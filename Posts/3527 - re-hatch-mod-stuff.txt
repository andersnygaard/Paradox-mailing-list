Yes, I had had the hatch closed for the previous 2.5 hours, so I did recognize the (potential) danger before it hit, and closed the hatch. 

I know 2 people who have made the same trip in similar circumstances (in a Wayfarer and an Enterprise) without trouble, but then it was probably just luck that I didn't do it without trouble. (I wouldn't have gone with them!)

Over centre type clips would hold it closed and it could be held against a neoprene sealing gasket.

I find the adjustability of the sliding hatch useful, I often sail with it partly closed. The folding hatch, with 'dome', may pose an obstruction to forward visibility when open. This is not to say that I am trying to discourage you from building one, I am just thinking out loud.

That was in Swamp Thing or Gjac wasn't it? Neither of which have a hard top.

I got some water in where the hatch was open for the harness to go through, enough to make my sleeve good and wet as I put my hand under the flow to stop myself falling. However there was not enough depth in the bottom to pump out and I had to dry it with a sponge. The time that water was coming in was just a few seconds before we popped up again and continued sailing. It was so quick that I suspect that even if the hatch had been open the amount of water to get in would have been in the 'nuisance' rather than 'danger' zone.

Next time I will reef more!
