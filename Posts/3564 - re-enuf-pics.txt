Subject: Re: Enuf pics?

Not sure what "dossing in laybyes" means, but I have heard the term "kip" being a fan of Monty Python. 

"Naw e's not dead guv, just havin a bit of a kip after a big squat. Lovely plumage - the Norwegian Blue, Probably pining for the Fiords he is!"

Places I have stopped for a kip, here in Canada are farmers "easments" - short turn-offs into their fields. And there are also occasional "rest stops" and all-night truckers centres, but they are usually smelly and noisy from the engines left running.

Better to stop at a small village gas station that is closed overnight. If anyone checks up on you, just tell them you are almost out pf gas and ask if they know what time it opens? 

Also I have pulled off at communcation towers. Having a white van is an advantage as it looks like I am just a service vehicle. The nice thing about them is they are usually at least 100 yards off the highway and are kept nicely nicely graveled in case it rains, and always kept plowed clear in the winter. They show up for miles too just like a welcome sign at night:-)

Another couple of options in small villages is to look for church steeples as there is usually a parking area nearby that is very quiet. If there is a graveyard as well - all the better. Nice quiet areas graveyards - usually with larger trees to park under:-)

I once observed a small motorhome during spring skiing time, parked behind a gas station that was closed for the winter and he was even plugged into their power. He was there for a week! You could not see him from the highway but could from the chalet we were staying at. Older couple with their two grandchildren:-)
