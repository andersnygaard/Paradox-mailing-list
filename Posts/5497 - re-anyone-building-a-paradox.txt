Yes, the step as drawn used to dig into my side when reaching forward and the dividers used to make the space quite restricted. I think that opening it up will make access easier though with the dividers more stuff can probably be packed in. (How you get at it then becomes the problem.) As I have a lot of unused storage space that shouldn't be a problem.

When I bought the bike, second hand, it also had the extended seat post, but I didn't need it. Then this summer I found someone who had a short post and didn't mind having the long one, so we did a swap. Which is why I suddenly decided to make the mods. With the short post it is almost a perfect fit.

This goes to show what a wonderful design concept PARADOX is and what a lot her pretenders and clones, which include NOLI, have to live up to.
