Rowlock that's the word I was looking for :0)

Ideally you want the top of the wedge parallel to the oar, but I
don't suppose it really matters.

If you mean an ordinary rowlock then be aware that there is high
likelihood of tangling with the sheet, which may lift it out, and
there will be significant wear on the oar, so good leathers are
needed. But many people scull using a rowlock.

If a rowlock socket is fitted it would be easy, later, to drop in the
designed pin (or some other system) if the rowlock was
unsatisfactory.

Today I made the yard. Took a look at my wood stock and
realised that the boom with a dead knot could be cut down. The dodgy bit with the knot is now near the end and the knot
is half the depth it was. I'm going to cut it out and fit a wedge shaped piece to replace it.

Questions: Is there any reason why I can't mount the yuloh in
a standard oar socket? Has anybody any knowledge of the respective merits of 2hp Honda and Suzuki outboards?
