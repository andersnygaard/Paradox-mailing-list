Nels,
I haven't done a lot of looking but the "Show only current waypoints" on
the Mapper shows these two "check points" which is the beginning and end
of the 40 mile portage.
"UF Stage 4 Traders Hill CP, Mile 770
Traders Hill on the St. Marys River, GA.
Challengers in classes 4, 5, and 6 may switch to a kayak or canoe for the
upper river sections and long portage."
The end of the portage....
"UF Stage 4 Fargo CP, Mile 840
Enter the Suwannee River at Fargo, GA."
You now know everything I do.  The trip down the Suwannee will be much
faster with the current.

John,

Does the portage begin at St. George and go up route 94 to Fargo GA -
where they put in on the Suwanee River? If so the two leaders, Whitecaps
and Manitou might make it to the portage before the day is out. Kind of
fun to zoom right in and see where they are. You can see some of the
fallen trees in the water. Lots of white sand and some really big oxbows
in the river. You can see at one place where the river almost rejoins
itself and there is a path right across, which cuts off about 1/2 mile
of paddling. Then there are some dead ends if you take the wrong fork.

WC has recently forged ahead of MC by about 3/4 of a mile at 11 AM EDT.
Matt has fallen back quite a lot and is going about 1 knot slower on
average. Hard to guess how far back as the river is so crooked.

Crazy Russian is just about at the mouth of the St. Mary's river. I
understand he may be carrying a folding bike as is Pelican. If the bikes
work as planned they can do the 40 mile portage in maybe 4-6 hours
compared to the better part of 2 days walking the boats over. Will also
be interesting to see how the mirage drive does speed-wise on the river.
