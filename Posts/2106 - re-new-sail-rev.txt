Hi Kjell.

It's probably more helpful to think in terms of the theoretical "center of effort", or "center of sail area", rather than thinking about the mast as dividing aft and fwd area.  Achieving proper balance will require a bit of experimentation with the halyard placement, after first having trimmed the boat to her lines.

Just as with most catboats, coming about can be a struggle if the rudder is stalled, ie: shoved to leeward too quickly.  I imagine that this can be particularly true with the Paradox design's rudder which is quite large, representing a great deal of the lateral area.  Of course, light wind requires even more attention.

Similarly, being sheeted in too much will cause problems.  It is generally helpful aboard most any catboat to tack rather more slowly than one would aboard a typical marconi rigged fin keel boat, with sheets tended at all times so that the luff is just curling or fluttering.  It would be helpful to add telltales to the sail to indicate flow at luff, leach, and draft.  I might be inclined to include them also just aft of the mast, which would be useful when the sail is bearing on the mast.

I really love the balanced lug rig.  A well made balanced lug sail can exhibit fantastic shape, with less requirement for control than other sails.  It is naturally low aspect, which places the centers of effort and balance very low. 

Should I eventually decide to have my sail built by a loft, I will provide a copy of Matt's "new sail" post from the files section, and emphasize that the sail does indeed need a great deal more draft than a similar sail for a lighter boat.  I may however, decide to sew my own sail, as it is easily managable by my machine and collection of seam rippers.
