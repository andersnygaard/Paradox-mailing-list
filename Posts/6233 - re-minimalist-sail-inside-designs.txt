How about configuring with the cabin at the rear and a flush deck forward?Don Elliot designed something along these lines.

There was a lot of discussion over at
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Smallboats/
when Don started his design work on Illusion.

IIRC his work developed from Squeezebox,

which was first designed as a lifeboat.

Unfortunately Don passed away before his work could be completed.
There remains all the correspondence over at smallboats, which unfortunately now only has spam posted there, but there remains a legacy of his outsatnding illustraions at an open directory here:

most of his work on illusion is here, it just needs someone to pick it up and run with it!
