Hi Matt.

You are right of course in the use of eco materials.
I forgot to say that I already had 6 sheets of 3/8" marine ply already otherwise my hall will stay cluttered up with timber if it was not used.
I hope that Dave, Mindy, yourself and others in the States fare well with the coming bit of high wind.
I am sure that all of us out here wish those in its path a happy outcome.
