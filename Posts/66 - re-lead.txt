There are a few reasons for tapping the wood as shown in the sketch.

One, the bolts are in a pieces of hardwood (not oak) and bonded to the hull with epoxy prior to threading, so tapping is safer and easier at that time. The tapping cannot be done on the bench as it has to be drilled and aligned at assembly. 

Two, I didn't want to take a chance on splitting the wood (Blocks and chines) if they did it would have created a lot of extra work.

Three, eventually I will bore oversize holes and fill with epoxy and place course threaded bolts in these modified holes (Waxed as you have said (but being very careful with the handling of the wax), so they can be removed, one thing I do not like any wax or oils around the boats at any time when I'm building a boat, as it can cause an epoxy bond to fail if the joint is contaminated with any of the wax), this is by far the strongest method, but takes extra time. 

So at the time the way it was done seemed the quickest and safest procedure. 

By the way the forward compartment leads (for trim weight to counter balance the battery) and held in place by heavy nylon straps (With bolts) as it was a tight fit.

The lead is sealed in heavy plastic, and has rubber padding on the bottom and top, the lead will never move in normal use. 

I intent to write an article on the these final steps on building Paradox for MAIB but haven't finished it yet.
