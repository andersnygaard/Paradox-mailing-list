Subject: Re: Seat Cushion

Do they make an inflatable armchair with a coffee cup holder Al?

I have a number of cushions. a hard foam, a soft foam and a small 
inner tube. I switch round every couple of hours and find that this 
reduces the pain.

I have wondered about getting a small inflatable arm chair, then I 
could be a real arm chair sailor.
