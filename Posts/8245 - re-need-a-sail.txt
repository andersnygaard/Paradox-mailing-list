I can't speak from experience with these sails yet as I am building now. However with 60 years of sailing experience its my opinion that how much sail you need is a factor of where you sail. I sail in the US midwest and have to cope with very light winds in August, a time when it is really nice to get out on the water. So I am opting for maximizing my sail area with a sail like the Mk 2. Alastair from Britain lives in a region of stronger winds and has cause for limiting his sail area. I expect to use the equivalent of one reef much of the time but will need all the power I can get when the wind and water go flat. I personally enjoy the rather intellectual game of nursing headway out of light breezes and expect that the higher peak and greater area will help me with that.

Feedback would be appreciated.

Thanks....Guy

PS: is the Mk2 sail an improvement over the standard design?
