Your inquiry about the folding kayaks made me look at the yostwerks site.=C2=A0 And now I am building a Sea Bee 13!! In order to complete the final stages of the paradox I am building I need a large chunk of cash for the hull glassing and finishing projects.=C2=A0 I was hoping to be in the water by May..... but it's not gonna happen.=C2=A0 Not with my paradox, anyway, so found lots of scrap wood and the Yostwerks site is very helpful.=C2=A0 

Now, if I could just get my wife to understand why I am building 2 boats...........

Subject: [paradoxbuilders] A folding Illusion

I have been musing over boats in general as I often do. Daydreaming. I was recently looking over the excellent designs of Tom Yost folding kayaks. And also looking over Matt Laydens Illusion design. Then I fused them together and saw an Illusion shaped boat built with folding kayak construction. At 9 ft. by 3 ft. the Illusion would be easy to make with aluminum tubing skeleton and vinal canvas skin. Even with a cabin with clear vinal windows too. To carry this boat folded up into a small package and fly off around the world and assemble it where ever you want would be wonderful. Keep it in the trunk of the car too. Smaller, lighter, thrifty and effective. Steve Yahn
