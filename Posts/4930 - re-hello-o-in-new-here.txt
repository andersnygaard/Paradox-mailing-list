Subject: Re: Hello :o) In new here.

From my own research, Matt built a boat called Little Cruiser in 1988, she measures 4.62m (and her current owners have been sailing her for 10+ years).

Admittedly she is a centre boarder but she carries an outboard on her stern (see http://www.microcruising.com/lc1.htm).

There is a prototype Enigma 460 under construction designed by Matt at http://e460.blogspot.com/ and as the name suggests she is 4.6m in length

And Jeff is building a 4.24m length Enigma ( see MY NEW BOAT.pdf at http://groups.yahoo.com/group/EnigmaBuilders-as-Designed-by-Matt_Layden/files/ ).

All of the latter designs use Matt's chine runners and are currently being constructed.

They all seem to me to be a developmental progression .

All of the latter I am watching with baited breath!
