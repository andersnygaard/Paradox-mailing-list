I had the good fortune to be passing Yeovil this morning where Al lives, and as always he welcomes anyone interested in 'Little Jim', his Paradox.
 
We spent nearly hours chatting, mainly about his super boat and I've come away all the more enthusiastic to carry on building my Paradox.
 
Thank you Al, for your hospitality and advice.
 
You're welcome (as is anyone else who wants to call round).
 
Hoping for calm nights

Yeovil, England.
