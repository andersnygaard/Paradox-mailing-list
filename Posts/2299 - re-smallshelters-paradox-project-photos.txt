Hi Dave,

I didn't realize you were that far along!

So I guess you require two more sheets of 3/8" plywood? By the time
you factor in the cost of fastners and glue, the amount of work and
wear and tear on the saw, plus the effort to fair it all up - I
wonder how much you end up actually saving, when stripping?

But it would no doubt work. I might be tempted to use heavier glass,
or maybe even (shudder) mat -  and maybe three longditunal strips for
stiffness and protection.
