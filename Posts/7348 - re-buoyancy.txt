Subject: Re: buoyancy

If the boat is full of water then you are floating in it so your weight doesn't count. In practice the worst case scenario doesn't apply so the real value is a lot less.

Builder's polystyrene sheet is waterproof and weighs very little. The density is about 3% of that of water.

I have about 200 litres of foam. My theory is that everything is in the boat is either replacing lead ballast or will add to the buoyancy so I only need enough to float the ballast. The only way the boat can end up completely full of water is if the sides are stove in so bailing will not be possible anyway. That's when you are glad you got that PLB. Well, that's the theory.
