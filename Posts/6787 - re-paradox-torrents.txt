I would like to know from you who have build a Paradox the following:

1. Completion time (would like to get on the water before I am grey)

It took me about 18 months working an hour or so each evening after work, and some time most weekends.

2. Basic Material needs (work in the charity industry, so budget is important)

I built using marine ply, but Matt built the original in exterior ply and it is about 20 years old now and still going strong. I believe one has been built using mainly salvaged wood.

3. Will it be able to occasionally cruise/race in the Wednesday round the can races?  (phrf rating, handicap rating for paradox?) 

I doubt if anyone has worked out a handicap figure.

4. If there is a picture of two people stretched out on the floor of the cabin

Dave has pointed you towards a picture.

Note that if the side bins are left out or modified then there would be a couple of more inches each side at the shoulders. If the insulation is also left out there that gives you another couple of inches each side.

However, I think, for 2 people to spend more than a weekend on board you would both need to be very tidy and organised.
