Andre....

I clicked on the link to your blog. WOW! I find myself totally in awe of a couple things. First, your blog is written in Portuguese, a language I cannot speak, yet Google translated the whole thing to english from me with one click. Amazing. AND THEN... well what do you know.... We live on the opposite ends of the world and speak different languages...but sailing is sailing. we enjoy the same things for the same reasons... LOVE IT! What an incredible gift to be able to communicate worldwide with each other! 

I very much enjoyed reading your blog about your boatbuilding and sailing.
