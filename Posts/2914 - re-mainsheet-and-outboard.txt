Hi Martin.

I remember the way to do it is to attach a bridle to the bow and stern cleats with a towing line fixed to it about 2/3rds from the bow, set the rudder slightly so the bow will turn out and walk on at a comfortable 1.5 - 2 mph. You can find the best towing position by adjusting the bridle F&amp;A and the rudder set. Try to get the boat moving as fine to the bank as possible.
