Cheers Bill.

I am getting quite excited at present as NOLI at last is coming together. Although I have designed and built about a dozen boats for myself, NOLI seem to be giving me the greatest buzz. Will the money hold out till the end of the build?

Some SOB took my door mirror off on my car the other day and drove off without stopping. I am having a new one fitted tomorrow. All electric with a built in heater. Ouch! That would have paid for a lot of epoxy. Lucky I am a head case or else it might worry me.

Did I tell you about the car insurance, electricity and gas bills I have just received this week as well. Lucky my sail won't be ready for about two months. I will post a couple of photo's again showing some details in the next few days.
