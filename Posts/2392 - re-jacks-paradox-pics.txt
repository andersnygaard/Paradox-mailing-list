Yes, 

I took her out to the same place with my buddy that helped alot on construction, to prove the windward preformance, the day started with light wind and things went fine. We had very calm sea state tide was at the end of her outgoing cycle in the bay, we went with the wind and current for about 3 miles and started tacking back home,.... pointing very well and basicly racing a few other small sailboats back, we were holding our own very nicely. as we were noticing we started loosing ground but still tacking well, I stated that the tide had changed and this is usually when we experience a weather change in the bay, boy was i right, just then the wind started to freshen, and with fall winds they like to switch and change and do circles...... uhhhhh as we passed a boat that had hit the sand bar on the way home he was just lifting off and starting to make his way home also the current picked up alot too, we noticed that every sail boat had pulled in the sails and headed in. A family out on a lobster boat pulled up beside us for about 15 mins very close, about 15 feet just simply amazed at us, staring at the boat. after a long afternoon of trying to get her into the cove we fell off and went for the protected side of the point and beached her and walked her along the shore for a few miles and paddled her back to the boat ramp. lessons learned, check the tides!!!!!!! I may find an inland lake sometime this week or weekend to take her out, at least I can camp in her, the nights are getting cold but shes a warm comfortable boat. ive also fitted a 30 lbs thrust electric trolling motor, guess il have to break down and build that yuloh. also looking at Glens topping lift, I think im going with something similar. If anybody else is thinking of going with the mk2 sail they may want to make the same considerations. I may even sew up the orginal sail this winter when cabin fever sets in, as a spare and something to compare to.

Paul,

I've posted two pics of Jack's Paradox from my visit last month to the files section, in the folder called Paul's Files.

Did you get any more sailing time in Jack?
