Subject: Re: trailer for paradox

I found that just a regular power boat trailer works fine for towing 
our two sharpies, Little Cruiser and Swamp Thing. The main modification 
I made to the stock trailer was to add two custom 2 x 6 treated lumber 
bunks that follow the rocker of the hulls. Of course this type of 
trailer is designed for a boat that has a heavy engine hanging off the 
transom; therefore you will probably need to centering your Paradox 
slightly ahead of the axle, which also means that the stern end of the 
boat may appear to be hanging off the trailer abit. Nonetheless, by 
positioning your boat this way, you will end up with the right amount 
of tongue weight, which seems to be around 100-150 lbs for our Accord 
and our expedition loaded boat. I don't think the exact weight is 
critical, but if you make it too light, the boat will bounce up and 
down like a bucking bronco everytime you hit a bump or dip in the 
road. During our long 900 mile trip to the Keys ever few years, I have 
not hesitated to trim Little Cruiser whilst on her trailer using some 
of the trip stores as well as some loose lead ballast to acheive that 
safe and comfortable tongue weight.

Happy towing.... Dave
