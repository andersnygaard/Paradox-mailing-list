The "filoir" is just a guide for the furler rope, to get it clear from the "arm" and running along the roof, I think.... I'll ask him
Same thing for the fingers in the plywood : I'll ask. I know he did a first attempt with round shapes, but didn't succeed (lack of precision). 
You'll find a second video on the top of the Google image page (without violins alas)

Yann is following a course to improve his English. Send him an email, it will be a good training :-))

Thanks, I had found the site for that boat, but didn't know about the video. In exploring the site I found the plans online too, but still don't understand how that furling system works. I'm not quite sure why the piece marked Filoire is used here?

I liked how he made the finger joints for scarfing plywood. Wish he showed how he made the jig for that.
