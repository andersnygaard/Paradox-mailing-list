Subject: Pete's video

Thanks again, Pete! Great video! 6 knots from a displacement hull under 14 feet loa; What a hoot! Al, why was the yuloh so far aft? New trim trick? I love the fact that you sail Little Jim sans motor. Also, the conditions you are sailing in are the same I hope my version of the Paradox will revel in as well.
