Subject: Re: Double Rudders

Thanks for all the sage advice.  I built a windvane self-steering for my Folksong.  It had a tab on the rudder and was very successful.  I've used the Hasler SP 90 on my Round Britain boat and that was excellent.  My Buccaneer used the Autohelm and that worked perfectly well, the battery being supplied with a Wasp wind generator.
The sort of sailing I envisaged was coastal cruising in UK waters.
I would like to fit a Hiscock type that is directly attached to a trim tab on the rudder, but how to do this on Paradox's rudder I cannot fathom since it folds upwards.
Hence my questions.
I know some windvane operated devices can be mounted to one side, but the ones I've looked at are all too large and heavy.
The lightest and most suitable would be the Navik, but that would need to be mounted outside the rudder, and because the rudder folds up, I can't see how it will work.
I'm not partial to the continuous whirring sound of the Autohelm, therefore I would prefer a windvane steering.

Cheers,
Bill.
