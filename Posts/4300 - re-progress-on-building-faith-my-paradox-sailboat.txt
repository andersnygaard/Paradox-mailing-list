Subject: Re: Progress on building 'Faith', my Paradox Sailboat


I made a holder for the bower anchor which stows upright in the cabin near the tunnel to the forecastle, but I haven't worked out where to put the kedge anchor.  I would like to have it on the stern deck, but I think the mainsheet would snag it.  The advantage of having it on deck is that mud and weed does not get caried below.  Having it on the foredeck means one has to get forward for anchoring, which under some circumstances would not be practical.

There is roughly a triangle, with the base along the rear of the cabin and the apex at the rudder, that is clear of the sheet. I did toy with the idea of fitting my Bruce anchor there, but couldn't find a way to mount it neatly, also this area is useful for standing on when entering or leaving the boat.

Going to the fore deck to anchor is not a good solution. It would be almost impossible to go forward safely with the sail up, and sometimes it is better to have the sail up (at least part of the way) before lifting the anchor

Yes, that's definitely a good plan.

There is a meeting on the Tamar 2nd June and on the Exe 16th June so it look as though you will just be in time to miss them :-(  Still, I should be able to join you for some of the time and definitely for the crossing to Scilly.

I am interested that you would sail from Falmouth. I would have expected Penzance to be the natural jumping off point.

I have faith in you.

Hoping for calm nights
