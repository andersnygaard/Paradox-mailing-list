I'm thinking of sailing 'Faith' to Holland next year for an exploration of the inland waters.

You wouldn't be disappointed with the Scilly Isles.

Incidentally, I have rewritten and illustrated the account of 'Faith's Cruise' which is available on a CD for anyone who makes a donation towards the upkeep of the Small Sailboats web site. Details can be found at:

Both of these boats are exciting projects and I would welcome a chance to see them on the water. Maybe the UK 'lads' could arrange a get-together in 2009?

Cheers
Pete

I'm pleased to see your boat is coming on well.
