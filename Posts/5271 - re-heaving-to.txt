I have found, in a F4, that lifting the rudder and heaving in tight on the sheet will leave you lying head to wind drifting astern at about 1 knot. If the sail is reduced the bow settles further off the wind. If the sail is dropped completely it lies nearly broadside on.

I have been told by an experienced sailor that sailing a Paradox is not like other boats. I cannot comment on this as I had little small boat experience before building Little Jim. However, I learned to sail LJ by following the advice of an old sailing friend of my youth: "Point the boat where you want to go and pull in the sheet until you are moving". It worked for me.

Hoping for calm nights.
