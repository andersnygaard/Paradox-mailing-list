Subject: anchor locker

Al has brought up a subject, which I also have contemplated: anchor stowage.

Dave and Mindy initially tried stowing a Bruce in a bow roller aboard Little Cruiser, but found that the weight perched on the bow was not conducive to performance.

A simple bucket full of line and an anchor can be employed, as can a canvas icebag on the afterdeck. I value visibilty, which suffers to some degree, when anything is stowed on the afterdeck.

I've brought up the idea of nylon webbing on a spool, used as an anchor rode, but still one needs an anchor ready to go. A Danforth type could be stowed on the afterdeck in chocks, without taking much away from visibilty, but it would be susceptible to fouling the sheet.

What about a flush anchor well for a Danforth type, installed in the afterdeck? It could drain overboard through the vent baffle (as low as possible, to assure dryness in a roll). It must be as shallow as possible so as not to interfere with the tiller, but this shouldn't be too much of a burden with the Danforth.

I imagine a similar arrangement could be worked out for a heavy, folding grapnel (squid anchor) in a tube. Such a tube could be installed off center, at an angle, perhaps with the bottom resting within the vent baffle for drainage. I think that a 4" PVC pipe would do the trick, and pose little issue with the tiller. This could conceivably be an easy retrofit for an existing boat. Perhaps a flush set, small rectangular bin could be fashioned, slightly forward and under the tube, for anchor rode (conventional) stowage. This bin would drain into the side of the tube and be accessed through a shared, rectangular, flush hatch. This situation would not take much away from the galley area, and would keep the primary anchor and rode out of the accomodations, while insuring unobstructed visibilty.

Ideas?
