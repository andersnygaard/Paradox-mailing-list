Possible, certainly, but how well would it work.

It is the tension in the wire that I would investigate first. The load in the sheet is probably greatest when gybing, anyone care to estimate a figure? Sometimes when close hauled it is most difficult to pull in the sheet.

If the wire starts parallel to the boom and is tensioned so that under maximum sheet load it angles 5 degrees off the boom then the load in the wire is 11 times the load in the sheet.

The wire would have to span the furling 'bearing' at the drum and the bearing at the clew. As designed these are simple and maintenance free. With the extra load you may want to fit proper bearings (with regular maintenance etc, and don't forget to carry spares.).

Bill and I both had problems, initially, with the tang at the boom end bending just from the load from the sheet.

Let us know what happens.

Also note that the indirect forward loading caused by the sheet helps keep the boom in place on the tack bearing.  This is useful if for some reason the tiny retaining screw for the hooked 'gooseneck' comes adrift, as happened with mine.  In fact I no longer use a retaining screw because the boom is always thrust forward by the sheet.
