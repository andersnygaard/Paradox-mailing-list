David,

My experience suggests that small and quiet are exclusive. I've used the Endless Breeze box fan with satisfaction. It's about 14"x14" but has 3 speeds, low power requirements, with satisfaction. It has saved my life (it just feels like that) many times in somewhat larger boats. When and if I build my Paradox, that's what I'll use even if I have to shoehorn it in.
