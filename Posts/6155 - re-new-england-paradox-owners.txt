Hot damn!

I hadn't seen any mention of a RI Paradox out there anywhere, so I assumed I'd be shipping off to somewhere in Mass. at the least.

I'm not sure if you sent an email or not, as my address didn't come up clearly. I also get loads of junkmail, so if you did send, by all means please give it another shot.

As far as the rest, I would be happy to get whatever advise you're willing to give. My boatbuilding skills are nothing to be bragged about: I've done some signifgant refit work on an 66' aluminum Palmer Johnson in Portsmouth along with repairing/painting my C&amp;C. Paradox will be my first 100% build, but I don't think she's outside of my capability as long as I don't go off half-cocked. I've been digging into the plans and doing plenty of thinking. I figured I would save up 'til I was certain to have enough money to get the majority of the material. The biggest thing I am facing is building space. I'm putting up a local listing offering some work in trade for some space, but I don't know if that's going to pan out. I'm not really in a rush, and circumstances are always changing. I'm actually refinishing my family's garage into an office for my Mom's new business, and its killing me inside!

Thanks for the great reply. I'm looking forward to scooting over those sandbars myself. Even with my 25 drafting 3' 10", I get excited with the thought of pulling up to shore when I get somewhere, rather than always anchoring and figuring it out from there. I gave some thought to stitch and glue as well. The nails vs. stitch and glue discussion had me thinking about how much better the nails could possibly be, especially if someone was to opt for a little extra glass.

Looking forward to hearing from yah. Fair winds!
