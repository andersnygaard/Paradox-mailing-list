Glenn,

Re: the sail aspect ratio...

My first attempt at the junk rig design for the Paradox did have a higher aspect ratio, but it moved the CE of the sail forward of the center of lateral resistance of the hull. I don't see how the rig can be adjusted much from the final product that I posted without creating a great deal of weather helm to the boat. I would appreciate your input. Personally, I was amazed at how far Matt place the sail rig aft to begin with.
