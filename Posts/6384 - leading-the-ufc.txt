Subject: ???...... Leading the UFC

Okay I don't know really, can you tell me where everyone is watching this? Is it online somewhere? Or must the observers watch there in person? Watching some would be far more fun than reading about it  

Is there a site listing the entries and the specs of each boat?

Matt Layden has never been a prolific writer about his boats. The sum-total about his "chine runners" can be narrowed down to one or two articles. I sure wish there were more.

Thanks,

Andrew

Wizard is presently (10ish AM EST) only about 30 miles ahead of Whitecaps and Manitou Cruiser, and has just hit about 4 knots for the first time in a while. I think he needs a larger lead than that to stay ahead once they start upriver. Pelican looks like he has gone "outside" and is clocking almost 6 knots!! Big gamble but he is a long ways back. Crazy Russian got stranded when he landed to rest, and could not get back out on the water again for awhile due to the surf.

The next two, Running Mouth and SnoreBringsGator are quite a ways further back. Don't know if there are any others left now?

Will be interesting to see if Matt stays in the ditch or heads off-shore for the final leg north, before turning upriver.
