Hi Verbertus,

Thanks for the kind words about the translation revision!

Regarding your question about Sven's latest project, the 7 meter something 2-person Bris, I think that project was commenced before he got to know about Paradox. It was meticulously built with custom-made everything, including screws and other small parts. After several years, he had to sell her without having sailed her. 

Now he wants a boat that is light enough to be carried on a car-top. His current design is better suited for this purpose, as it should be very easy before the wind and to scull. Additionally, boat design is also a question of "feeling" for him.

As for an English edition of the book, I actually wrote to the editor some 2 years ago after having read the manuscript as a kind of referee. I suggested that the book probably had more potential readers outside Sweden, but publishers are often very cautious, especially within a small language like ours. One way of promoting an English edition would be to post an excerpt here...

Best regards,
Kjell Karlsson
