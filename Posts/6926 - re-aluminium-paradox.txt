Subject: Re: [paradoxbuilders] A question about build time vs the Enigma.

i think many would be builders of Paradox are put off by the amount of effort it takes to complete. me for one. so i have been thinking that if i do undertake a build i would use aluminium which is stronger and would, i think, cut down on the time significantly.
