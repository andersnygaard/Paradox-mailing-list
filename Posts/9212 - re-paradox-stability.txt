Yes

Twice

Once on purpose, to see what would happen, I set the boat up to roll, during a big race regatta, next to the judges boat, took a sharp wave directly abeam, full sail. It rolled to almost right angles, sat for a second, the abruptly rolled upright, it came up quickly.

Some months later I was in shallow water, end of the day, looking for a tide race inshore to speed me up, after a slow day I was hunting for more speed. Silly me
Hatch open, anchor near me ready to set, fishing rod out looking for dinner
First I knew was the noise of the wave breaking, I mistakenly sailed over a reef with shallow water
I had the Honda motor idling and it disguised the noise a bit
Then it was over, sail buried underwater, boat over 90 degrees
Me hanging on with the wave bulldozing me along, very powerful force from any waves in shallows with a current stirring it up, scooping up water through the hatch
Full on sideways push

The wave eventually overtook the boat, maybe five to ten seconds later
The sail emptied of water shortly after, and BOOM! up came the boat, with a vengeance
Nothing polite about it righting itself, I got bruised from slamming into the hatch side.
Water sloshing in the bilge, anchor gone, fishing rod gone, other stuff too
I turned seaward and the Honda was still ticking over and I powered up and ride over four more largish waves, shaking, wet, but safe.

Never been over since
And I watch shallow water with a tide running

I have every confidence in the boat, I have all the ballast the plan asks for, don't skimp on ballast.
