Yes, I think that is where we will be (DCA rally). I have never been there before so am not too sure.

I am sailing across from Chichester on Saturday, so won't be too near Ryde then (I hope!), but I don't have to be back 'till Monday so have Sunday fairly free if you want to orchestrate something.

Hoping for calm nights
