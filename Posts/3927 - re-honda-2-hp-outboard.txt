Subject: Re: Honda 2 hp outboard

Would it be worth having a spare throttle cable?

---

Hi All,

I am researching my Honda 2hp outboard, Im putting together some 
spare parts for an extended cruise I plan on taking this winter down the 
Tenn-Tom waterway to the Gulf Of Mexico. It will be a 300 mile trip 
with the Honda as my main power.

I have not had any trouble with my Honda and am looking for some 
insight from other Honda users as to the spare parts Im might be needing. I have the norm, shear pins, props, spark plugs, etc. Any 
suggestions?

Best regards

David Beard
