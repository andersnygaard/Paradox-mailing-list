Online source for metals. Really nice site! They specialize in small
quantities, and seem to have quite an inventory. Located in Seattle.

My boat is coming along well. I only got my deckbeams laminated back
in May, before having to take a few months off to maintain house,
cars, etc. I should be springing the sides around the bulkheads this
weekend. I'll post some photos when it starts taking on a third
dimension. Having fun with this little project.
