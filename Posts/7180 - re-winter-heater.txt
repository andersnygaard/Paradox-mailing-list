Hi Geoff,

I use the 'easy light' barbecue charcoal which is impregnated with some kind of oil, probably kerosene, so easy to get going. It burns with a visible flame for a couple of minutes then just 'glows' like charcoal should. Also have used tiny scrap hard wood bits - about the size of an Oxo cube, with success. I normally cheat by sticking a teaspoonful of methylated spirits in before I try and light up. Because the fire is so tiny you have to add more fuel every few minutes and open the bottom draught hole about half way to keep it going. To extinguish just let it run low on fuel or close the bottom hole and it goes out in a few mins.

If doing it again, I'd use a bigger dia tube, say 3 or 4 inches dia. It would give off more heat and hold more fuel so making it easier to maintain the critical mass required for combustion. 
Also I wouldn't have to spend ages making the charcoal or wood bits so tiny.

Jim
