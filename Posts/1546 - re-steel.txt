"Oil canning" comes from the days in the early part of the 20th century when petrol (gasoline) was sold in England in squarish "tins" of several gallons each. These tins were simple, folded thin metal solders together and the sides would easily pucker, whether or not they had fuel inside- hence the term "oil canning".

Yes, I would use a heavier bottom, maybe 1/8" (.125), but then I'd really have to do the math to decide whether or not much water ballast was really needed- unless I wanted it for drinking water.

By oilcan you mean dent up??  I would go with a thicker plate for bottom, 3/16th? or so, what ever would be about the same as the target wieght.

Another thing would be I think with steel we could come up with a good water tank system thats VERY cleanable making gasketed hatch cover should be easy I do not like those production type covers.

Also the frame tubing is hollow this will aid in boyancy if flooded.
