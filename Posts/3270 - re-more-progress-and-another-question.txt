If you mean an ordinary rowlock then be aware that there is high 
likelihood of tangling with the sheet, which may lift it out, and 
there will be significant wear on the oar, so good leathers are 
needed. But many people scull using a rowlock. 

If a rowlock socket is fitted it would be easy, later, to drop in the 
designed pin (or some other system) if the rowlock was 
unsatisfactory.

Today I made the yard. Took a look at my wood stock and realised that the boom with a dead 
knot could be cut down. The dodgy bit with the knot is now near the end and the knot is half 
the depth it was. I'm going to cut it out and fit a wedge shaped piece to replace it.

Questions: Is there any reason why I can't mount the yuloh in a standard oar socket? Has 
anybody any knowledge of the respective merits of 2hp Honda and Suzuki outboards?
