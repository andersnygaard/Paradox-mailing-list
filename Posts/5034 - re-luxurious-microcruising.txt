Sorry for the delay...I've been away for about a week. I agree completely that one should never forget about the dangers of CO. Good ventilation is necessary, and an exhaust path is part of that. CO monitors are easily available and are recommended for more or less enclosed spaces, boats, trailers, and house basements and such. There are even cards or tags available which will change colour if the O2 level starts to drop. In this day and age with this sort of gear easily available it seems a little daft to not have something. to suppliment your common sense.

Hi All, John
 
Just be very careful. Heat diffusers can be carbon monoxide generators and even with Paradox's excellent ventilation you don't need too much to have serious health problems. The worst thing about them is they are not immediately obvious, just slowly feeling lethargic, achey, often taken to be a flu coming on.
Enjoy

They said, get a life. I looked on TradeMe but I couldn't find one.

I'd guess the Paradox would be fine with a couple of candles and some sort of heat diffuser
