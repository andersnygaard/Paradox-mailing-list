Subject: Re: Epoxy and Varnish

Hi Derek,

I like epoxy to close the grain in the wood and seal it then light sand and varnish, the varnish protects
the epoxy from uv. once I coated in varnish and waited a week it burned a hole in my yard sleeve about
8 inches long. I added a leather chafe protector to the sail and its taking the abuse well. As far as the
boom I hadn't shortened it and it would easily dip into the water. I cut it back and last time out we
dipped it twice, but the reasons that it hit the water is a combination of things like where I sail every area
has different wind conditions, also strong current areas and a tide that's always keeping things
interesting. I would seal and varnish everything completely to protect it. things are going to get wet.

Hi

Just made the boom while I waited for the current bit of the mast to set and I'm just about to put on the
reefing spool(?).

I'm starting to think about the finish for the mast, boom and yard.

I like to see a wooden mast with a painted end. Should I epoxy the whole spar or varnish or epoxy
then varnish? Or, is there another way to tackle this that I ought to know about? Do I treat the
boom and yard differently to the mast. I remember that Jack's hits the sea sometimes. I could fit a
wader, or a rubber glove on the end :0)

I just spent a happy half hour using a cabinet scraper around the knots in the boom and then
realised that it will be hidden in a sleeve of the sail!

thanks all  ....  Derek
