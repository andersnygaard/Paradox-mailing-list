Subject: Re: About cat sail for Paradox.

Hi Jimmy,

What do you mean by a "cat sail"? Are you thinking of a rig where the sail and boom are attached directly to the mast? Like this?

I do not think anybody has done that, and I think it would be a bad idea. That kind of rig would be very difficult to handle from inside a Paradox. The rig as drawn by Matt is perfect the way it is. Nobody has been able to improve on it to my knowledge.
