Subject: Re: [paradoxsailboat] Replacing windows.

Hi Chris,

Here is how I approached the windows.

I painted the area of the window that rested again the wood of the boat with one part poly. Pick a color: white or black. Then I used the butyl tape that Rod Collins sells aka Maine Sail. It's the good stuff because of its elasticity without breaking off a surface.

No leaks and the windows can be removed in the future. In the picture below you can see the edge of the black paint on the inside of the window. The payment protects the tape from uv.

Keep it simple: no goop.

Best,
Deric
