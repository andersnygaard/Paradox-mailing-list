I would really appreciate a picture of Matt Layden's SWAMP THING which appeared in Ida Little's book, "Beach Cruising and Coastal Camping." SWAMP THING is now in my back yard, and I am trying to figure out what is original and what has been added on since Matt first cruised this tiny sharpie to the Bahamas. If you wouldn't mind sending me a high resolution scan I would really be grateful. You can use my email at mbolduc@triad.rr.com. I probably won't get to restore the boat this year since I am in the middle of covering LITTLE CRUISER in fiberglass; but hopefully by next Summer, she will be sailing once more. SWAMP THING's got some rot in the bottom and in the deck so it's going to take a bit of work to get her going. However, I think the project should be fun.
