Hello,

My name is Cory and I have a partially completed Paradox. I still can't believe I have a freking Matt Layden Paradox in my driveway! The hull is complete, minus epoxy sheathing and some cut outs. The interior was just started when Brian Prescott the previous owner passed away. I rescued it from a burn pile and dragged it home on a trailer in a snowstorm. I took measurements and all seems very close to plans and even screws were used instead of nails for sides and bottom. This was not Mr. Prescott's first try to build a boat. I am a carpenter, with some interesting tools (cnc, 2'×3' duplicator, ect.)that will be put to good use. The boats name will be "Prescott Eagle" with the goal of an August maiden.  Her home port will be Kincardine Ontario Canada and sail the great lakes for now.

My first question is: Has anyone completed a sharp bow as to the planned snub nose? If so what would your comment be towards performance increase/decrease as opposed to leaving it snubbed?

Thanks!

Cory
