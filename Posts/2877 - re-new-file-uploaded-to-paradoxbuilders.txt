Hi Folks,

When I try to open the file you mention, realplayer pops up and gives me a message that  "new software is required to play this clip" then a notice it cannot find the software. So how do I go about connecting the torrent software up with realplayer? Or should I be using Windows Media Player or my favorite which is Winamp?

I was unable to follow the dialog that was flying back and forth here. But I have some video clips I would like to upload as well.

Paul, do you have the clip on your website which is what I was waiting for. Do you have the url for it?

Thanks, Nels
