I am sure you *could* do it, many less seaworthy boats have made similar trips. Whether you *would* do it successfully would depend very much on the conditions at the time. Whether you *should* do it is something I am not in a position to comment on.

Many people have asked me if I could sail Little Jim across the English Channel to France. My usual response is that I could but what is the use of owning a boat like this if you don't put it on the ferry. I find crossing open water, out of sight of land, very tedious and would rather spend my time sailing along the French coast.
