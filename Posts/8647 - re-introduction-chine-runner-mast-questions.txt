Thanks everyone for your speedy replies. I have viewed many videos of the paradox and have decided to build it as designed. I believe the stability is fine as is. I emailed the mbolduc@triad.rr.com address on the micro cruiser website for plans and have been reading through the posts in this group in preparation for the build. I am a very amateur carpenter and look forward to learning as I build. Is there a list of required tools for build as well as an inventory of materials needed for this project? I plan on acquiring the proper tools and materials through the next couple months and starting build in the fall of this year. I'm sure my wife will wonder why I am finally cleaning out the garage ( where I will construct)!

Your right once it's upside down it just matters that it's now heavy on the top side,and trying if you will , to balance on a curved deck .
The dynamic balance and "feel" is improved by weight outboard
The static balance is not effected by where the lead is placed in the bilge , providing , that it is symmetrically placed .

Having ballast as far outboard as possible might improve the roll characteristics and the dynamic balance,  but will not help the righting moment.
Each outboard weight will balance the other:  as one creates a righting moment the other will balance with a heeling moment.

Hi Erik , I live in Australia and have tested my paradox in rough seas
Only to the point of being knocked down , not rolled over
And the righting moment was fine , I have ballasted the boat with lead bolted along the inside of the hull , inside the chines , as far outboard as I could get it , it helps the dynamic stability , to keep the ballast lead outboard . I asked the engineering department of Adelaide University for advice on it . Nutty I know , but I'm a novice boat builder and like you wanted to be sure .
The rounded deck and roof coupled with the sheer amount of weight in the bilges has me more than convinced it will right itself , if rolled , there are stability graphs around too , for the a Paradox , I found them on a Google search and again when I ordered the plans . It's very comforting at sea , it feels solid and stable . I fell asleep the first time I was in it , about 5 miles out from shore . I have other boats and this one is big fun .....
Flotation foam , or if you like , insulation foam , placed wherever the space allows , means if the boat is swamped it should sit proud of the water , even when swamped
I measured the buoyancy of the woods I used . Did some math on that .
Calculated the area that I filled with buoyancy foam ( the sort of foam they use to make surfboards , it sands easily and was shaped to fit under the decking and floor in places , see the pic below )
There are stories around of one being swamped , bailed , and sailing on .
I let the boat be blown over in about 25 kts of breeze
It sat on its side momentarily
I touched nothing , I just laid  there waiting to see what would happen
It popped up , turned into wind a bit , and laid a hull , or heaved too ,if you like ,  drifting across the chop sideways until I fiddled with sail and tiller to get it going again, I then reefed the sail and went home . It Was an experience that confirmed to me that I'm as safe as the design suggests l
Uncomfortable yes , being on its side is not natural , but safe all the same .
Hope this helps
Nick

Hello! I am Erik from northeast Ohio I have a Com-Pac 23 sailboat and sail primarily on Lake Erie. I have been bitten by the Paradox bug and I am researching building one. My main purpose for building will be to sail in the Great Lakes/Georgian Bay skinny waters and a Florida to Bahamas adventure in a couple years (crossing GulfStream of course). I love the elegant simple design of the Paradox but I am still not 100% sold on a keel-less boat out in offshore conditions. In an effort to increase the chance of righting the boat I have been trying to work on a solution to instill more confidence in the event of a capsize. My ideas are in order of preference.
1. Add lead to gap between chine runner and side of boat covering with fiberglass. This will increase the moment arm for self righting. I don't think this will help for a 180 degree roll though.
2. Adding a bolt on lead bulb-keel of 10-12 kg concentrated near end of keel perhaps 15-20cm in length. This will also increase the righting moment arm. It could be taken off when offshore passage is completed.
3. Installing as buoyant mast as possible and/or running a tube through/alongside mast with an inflatable "balloon bladder" at top of mast. Tube could be attached to a small compressed air cylinder allowing it to be filled several times if you get in series of BAD survival storms.

So there are my ideas on this subject. I want to increase my odds of righting my craft. Have these ideas been tried yet, would they work?
