Yes, thanks, very clear. I noticed the model you bought is rated for a carrying capacity of 580 KG. Any idea of how close to that you are when loaded for the road?

Also, I noted that your trailer is unbraked, as are, I gather from rummaging through posts in the group, several other trailers used by Paradox owners (Faith, Zoe, etc.).

Also, I'm wondering how realistic a 480 KG road weight is, assuming 160 KG lead + gear, but no water ballast or crew on board.
