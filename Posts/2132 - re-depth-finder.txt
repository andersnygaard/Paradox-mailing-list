Subject: Re: depth finder

Reading Dereks letter made me think, how about using a fish finder.
They do everything a depth finder does and more. They also scan forward and show how the bottom is made up.
Oh! They also tell you if there are any fish about.
They cost about the same to.
Fitting a sounder to a PARADOX I suppose one would make a hole in the plywood bottom through to the glass fibre and bond the PVC pipe to it, filleting around the pipe and plywood.
