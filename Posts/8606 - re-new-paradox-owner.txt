There is a time in our lives where reality an procrastination cross. After having the plans to build a Paradox for years I figured if I was going to own one I should hunt around and buy one already built.

I was able to buy Mark Waters Paradox from Folsom California. Mark is a shipwright who has built several boats and he used System Three epoxy for construction. It has only been sailed a couple of times. I picked up the boat last month and it is now in Scottsdale Arizona. I look forward to sharing my adventures and questions with this group.
