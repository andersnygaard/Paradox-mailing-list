Subject: Re: Sail rigging

I think I found the #1 problem (actually 1st of several) – the boom is warped. When I suspended it from the ends and reefed it, it was not smooth as you suggested it should be.

Now the question is how to remove the warp or should I replace it? It is Spruce and I think I would be better off with Fur. It did sit on two sawhorses for a long time, maybe I can weight the center and bring it back to straight? Suggestions?
