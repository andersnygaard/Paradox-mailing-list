Dear Paradox Builders,

I am having great trouble fitting the shear, particularly from frame 3 to the transom. The shear curves sharply down towards the transom and curves following the hull shape. The timber needs to be curved in two directions. Is that possible at all? Do I have to steam the shear? Actually, I am completely in the dark.

I am writing this for some help/advice.

Regards,
