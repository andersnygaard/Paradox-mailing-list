Subject: Re: Ironside revisions and progress

Today I discovered that the tackstrop pins which had cotterpins acted like fishooks and snaged the rope I setup for reefing. So I reworked the design and made fewer pieces and made new pins which use snaprings. This also fixed the overlong issue the old design had. I repainted the gray cabin sole to a tan color and installed it. I installed the foam insulation in the cabin and screwed down the varnished liner panels over both sides. The foam just "floats" between the hull sides and the liners. It's a snug non-moving fit. Now bulkhead 3 has no intrusion into the look or feel of the cabin. Just as I visualized it. I made an aluminum bracket to hold the mainsheet cam cleat and mounted it. I made a deck-block to hold the for end of the yuloh. I fitted the tiller with it's blade lifter jam cleat and fairlead. I mounted the side deck "arches" to hold the sail and yuloh. I made three rope fairleads out of delrin and fit them in their holes. The end is in sight. I put up a few photos too. I'm itching to launch!

Thanks Steve.  I, and I'm sure many others, can sense your excitement prior to the moment when you will launch Ironsides for the first time.  Your enthusiasm is inspiring and heartwarming.  I wish you success, much enjoyment and satisfaction.

Bill.
