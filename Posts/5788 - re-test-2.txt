Ok, your tested, and passed :) :).

My computer crashed and I changed my IP, and am having trouble setting everthing up, Im tired of messing with it, so I just hooked up my Paradox "Whisper" for a little (electronic free) trip down the " Tenn-Tom Waterway". 

I will be leaving Picwick lake in Tenn. and end up in Amoy Ms. a good two day trip. (A Christmas Present to myself)

Merry Christmas,

David
