Hi Pete,

Have a look at two photos of my trailer I have uploaded to the Photos section in the 'Faith' album.

My trailer is unbraked and I can tow 'Faith' easily behind my Ford Mondeo. When launching and retrieving the boat, the wheels are always below the water, because I need that depth to get her off or on the trailer.  The bearings are sealed, and so far I have had no problems with them.

Al has a much bigger trailer with an extended rear end, which means he can launch his 'Little Jim' without getting the wheels wet.  His trailer is fitted with brakes.

Cheers,
Bill.


Bill,

I'm currently driving a Mondeo also, so it looks like I shouldn't have too many problems on that front. I'd prefer a braked trailer to make control on slipways, ramps etc a bit easier. Al's trailer is certainly the way forward. My problem with that is that I don't think I'd have room for something that large at home so I'd end up storing somewhere else, which I'd prefer not to do.

My trailer is, as near as I could make it, the same  size as the boat with the drawbar sticking out the front and the wheels sticking out the side.

I suppose by raising the boat up and putting the wheels underneath it could be made narrower.

Hoping for calm nights

Al,
Yeovil, England.
