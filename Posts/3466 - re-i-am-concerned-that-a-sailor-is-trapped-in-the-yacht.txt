Hi Derek

Perhaps we had better take this conversation off list
as it's more to do with flying than sailing...;-)

BTW I hope to go and see a Paradox in the flesh
tomorrow afternoon. I wonder how it will seem after
looking at the pics and descriptions on the web.

You know how one has a picture in one's mind about how
it is and how it feels to be aboard. It will be
interesting to actually see one in the flesh and find
out for myself all those answers about access to the
f'ward compartments etc.

Jim Hall
