nels,
I am using plain old hardware store Ring Nails for the Decking { Ilike their Holding abilitie} and "Gold" Deck Screws for the Bottom. The deck screws seem to hold up pretty good. I had some in a fence that I built 6 years ago, I unscrewed them when I took the fence down and the most damage I saw was a little discoloration on some of them. Everything will be encapsulated so that shuld help deter rot/rust etc. Also this Boat probably will not ever be on the Ocean. Lakes, Rivers and Streams.
