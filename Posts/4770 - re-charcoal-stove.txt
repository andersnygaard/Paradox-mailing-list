Ps, what are the main constituent elements of the paradox series 
design?
I have done ome thinking;- 
1) Inside sailing position, 
2) internal ballast,
3) simple lug rig, 
4) Chine runners,
5) heavy displacement (except enigma)
  

To me it is not the 'what' of the design but the 'why'. Paradox seems 
to me to have been designed to solve a series of specific problems. 
So, for example, the lug rig, which is mechanically simple, is 
conceptually quite complicated and is an integral part of the whole. 
Extracting it and fitting it to a different boat may well produce a 
pig's ear.

So to answer your question, in my opinion the main constituent 
elements of the Paradox series design are that it will carry the crew 
in comfort and safety, in shallow water, in relatively poor weather, 
without the crew having to do anything energetic.

It will also, of course, do the same in deep water and good weather.
