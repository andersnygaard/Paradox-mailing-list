Hi,

Now hold your white horses. I wrote the comment not Ron and I only meant that Chief thoroughly vets the boats and their equipment, or so I believe. I've no doubt that in Winter and hurricanes it is awesome sailing but not in a Frolic 2 or Paradox 1. I don't suppose Chief runs challenges in hurricanes and my limited knowledge of him leads me to think he is a thorough sort of cove in the safety department. I'm not terribly impressed by the depth; I've come close to drowning in less than 1% of that.

Your last sentence I don't fully understand.

Best wishes
