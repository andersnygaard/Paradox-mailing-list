Hello Bill,

I still have not worked out how to make the socket. It needs to be made of a tough material able to withstand wear from the ball and yet run smoothly. Well greased metal to metal is probably the answer, somthing like a unversal joint from a bit of machinery. Because the yuloh is stowed beside the cabin trunk there would not be room for a permanent universal joint fixed to the yuloh ready for insertion into a shaft on the transom. The universal joint would have to be a separate item inserted every time is isused, which is not clever as it could be lost over the side.

What solutions have others found for the yulon?

Copper against a harder metal may not survive for long. Stainless steel tubing could be an answer.

Well, thanks Jim. There's always something to learn.

Maybe this is worth considering. That's the value of a discussion group such as this.

Grease or tallow has been used over the years and it works, but I agree with you, about not wanting to get greasy.

Bill.
