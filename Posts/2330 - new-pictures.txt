Hi all,

I have uploaded some new pix in the files section. When I mounted the aft baffel, it became too steep. So I had to recut it in a peculiar way. Hope it doesn't affect the function. The tiller looks weird. All in fibreglass and epoxy though. The bronze bottom at least looks shiny, doesn't it? I excluded the earlier discussed curvature and just cut it. And upon the protruding part I moulded the chinerunners in fibreglass and epoxy. So now I can slice mermaids. If you wonder about the hole in the stem, it's a stainless steel tube, instead of a fastening loop, because of difficulties in getting grip in the divinycell. It's Sven's idea, of course.
