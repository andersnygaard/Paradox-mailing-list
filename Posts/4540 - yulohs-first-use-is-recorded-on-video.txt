Subject: Yuloh's first use is recorded on video.

For a rather boring video of me using 'Faith's' yuloh for the first time you can have a look at:

Apologies for the sound track during the first half. Skylarks can be heard in the second half when 'Faith' is almost a dot in the distance.

There's a lot to film making, I can see, and a lot more practice will be required to get the best out of the yuloh.

Bill.
