After more thought on this I have come up with some more ideas on this.

Very important is the priming and painting of steel, either regular paint, or epoxy encapsualization, the problem with square stock is that it will lie on the plate and cause a steel to steel joint that is not primed and painted, one way around this is to obtain preprimed weldable steel, or use round tubing so that the paint can coat completely. I dont think it would matter much from the welding standpoint.
