I needed to do something for ballast to get my boat in the water. At 
Loews I bought 80 concrete bricks at .25 cents each. They weighed 5 
pounds each. So 400 pounds for $20.00 got me going right away. Later 
if the money and lead come together then I can use the bricks in the 
yard somewhere. I made little wooden blocks and wedges to keep the 
bricks from shifting. Lead for one dollar a pound is what I found 
here too. Casting the concrete like Buehler did might be hard to move 
or remove someday. 

Good luck, Steve Yahn
