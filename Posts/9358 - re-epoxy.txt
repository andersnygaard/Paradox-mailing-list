Hi Sybe,

For all my gluing, I just used West epoxy with their microbead filler. Worked like a charm. I used chopped strand only with epoxy for the centre of the gudgeon with about four layers of 200gm cloth around the outside. That gudgeon is so strong, it leaves any metal gudgeon for dead.

Cheers,

Rob.
