Subject: Visit to Al's

Dear Paradox Builders,

I had the good fortune to be passing Yeovil this morning where Al 
lives, and as always he welcomes anyone interested in 'Little Jim', 
his 
Paradox.

We spent nearly hours chatting, mainly about his super boat and I've 
come 
away all the more enthusiastic to carry on building my Paradox.

Thank you Al, for your hospitality and advice.

Cheers,
Bill.
