Subject: Re: How do I rig my sail for windward ability

Geoff,
Without being there and knowing your experience resume, I would suggest:
1) The sail needs to be relatively flat for that strength wind.
2) The sail should show some signs of luffing about 5-10% of the time in that seaway. (when the boat pitches forward) 
3) The boat must maintain good forward speed for the chine runners to be effective.

You should be able to do much better that that. 
Is the boat healed a good bit in those conditions...it should be? or, are you trying to sail flat?
