Subject: Paradox Transom Height??? Please help!

Hi,

Could someone please tell me the overall height of the Paradox Transom.

On drawing #8 i have 459mm from the base to the top of the Starboard side. The measurement from the top of the side to the top of the deck curve is missing.

I know i could find this once the deck beams are built but, i would like to cut all my bulkheads out first.

Thanks in advance.

Craig.
