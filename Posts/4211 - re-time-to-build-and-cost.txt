It cost about 2500UKP and took me about 18 months of evenings and weekends, fairly continuous building, with just the odd week off.
W O W !!
That's a LOT of work!
With that kind of time frame, it should take ME about 6-10 years.

I haven't built a Paradox, but have built the similar sized (and complexity) Bolger Micro Navigator. (I self confess that I am a 'quick and dirty' builder.) My build took about 450 manhours spread over two years, plus about $1,000 USD (with lots of scrounging). If I were to do it over I estimate it would come out at 300 hours and $1,500.

Paradox, though small, is really a big boat squeezed into a small package.
