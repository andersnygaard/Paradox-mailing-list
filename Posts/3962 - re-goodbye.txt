Sad to see you leave but keeping your health plays an important part in making such decisions. I myself would like to sail around the globe but health is causing a prohibitive plan and thus I find joy sailing by reading other sailors logs, shared experiences and pictures that are posted on their sites. 

Good luck and God bless.
