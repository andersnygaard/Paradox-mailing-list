I have 930mm between the floor and the closed hatch. It is worth noting that, when sailing from inside, I am rarely sitting bolt upright but am much more likely to be slouching in the corner.

Several builders have put the removable rear window in their Paradoxes. I doubt if many sit there while sailing, the seat with it's backrest would be much more comfortable. It would be nice when at anchor, chatting to other boats, to be able to sit there with your feet on the seat. If you really feel you must get out of the cabin while sailing I can recommend sitting dabbling your feet in the water over the transom, very refreshing.

Hoping for calm nights
