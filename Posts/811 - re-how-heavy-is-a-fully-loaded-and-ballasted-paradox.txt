Dear oh dear boys,

Lets not get confused by designer talk.

Designers refer to displacement as the weight of water the boat pushes out of the way so they have a way of considering boats that are partially dynamically supported - by planing or foils (water or air).

For displacement boats, like the Paradox, the gravitational attraction of the earth on the boat and its contents (their weight) must equal the "push" the water trying to get back into the space the hull pushed it out of (that could be said better but not on the fly). If the boat and contents weigh more they will be pulled towards the earth displacing more water. If the push of the water to gey back to it's "natural" space is greater it will push the boat up a bit. So displacement (of a conventional sailing boat at least) will be the weight of the water pushed out of the way in the act of floating and always equal the weight of the boat and it's contents.

Designers divide the weight of a boat into "liveweight" and "deadweight". I find the easiest way to think of this is that the boat is a living thing and it has a liveweight but it also carries things (including the crew) which make up the deadweight. Close enough, the liveweight will be the trailing weight and the deadweight everthing you put in the boat.
