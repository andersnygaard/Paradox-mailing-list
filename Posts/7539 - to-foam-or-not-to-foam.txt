Subject: To foam or not to foam...

I'm pretty much at the point I need to cut and fit foam panels or do without. I'm having trouble finding anything but white styrofoam. 

Pros: 

Flotation. 
Insulation, though not needed much in my area. 

Cons:

Doesn't look like it's a fun job. 
Expense. 
Loss of storage volume. 
Easily damaged. 
Mildew issues. 

Let me know if I missed something because foamless looks pretty good. I just hate to try and second guess the designer though. 

I spent several hours shaping my yuloh last week. It's not perfect but much better than I expected it to turn out.
