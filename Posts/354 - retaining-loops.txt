Subject: Retaining loops?
Date: Tue, 19 Feb 2002 18:52:11 -0000


I'm looking at the plans, and at the photo of Paradox under sail
that I have as my screen background, and I'm wondering about the
two brass tube retaining loops that hold the yuloh (to starboard)
and lowered rig (to port) aboard.  I think I understand how the
yuloh stays in place, given the forward loop that's attached to
the intermediate deck beam (but what keeps it from sliding aft?),
but I'm a bit confused about the portside loop that's supposed
to keep the lowered sail and spars aboard.  What holds the
forward part of the sail aboard?  There must be something, or
there'd be a second retaining loop, but what am I missing?
