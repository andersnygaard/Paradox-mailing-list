Subject: Re: Colour Schemes


Designers use complimentary colors when they wish to attract the eye of the viewer. The color scheme in compliment will give the impression of energy as the colors have their own sense of vibrancy. You can use any of a hundred different colors in the general green scheme to enhance or reduce this effect. A trip to a good paint store and the use of their chip charts will give you the relationships you wish.

Keep in mind that this type of scheme can also become tiring for those on board as it excites the part of the brain that responds to color. If the hull colors are kept muted above the gunnels, it should provide for a more sooting effect.

A paler green with the red sail, perhaps?
