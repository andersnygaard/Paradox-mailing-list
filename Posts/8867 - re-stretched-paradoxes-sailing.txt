Subject: Re: Stretched Paradoxes Sailing?

I’ve never heard anyone say that a lug can outpoint a marconi sloop upwind.  Ease the sheets a bit and it’s a different story :-)  

As to the leeboard/fin comparison, I think that’s going to boil down to aspect ratio of each.

I'd love to see your evidence on this.

This seems to echo the nonsense I've heard floating around that a lug sail, Gaff, Junk, etc, can point higher then a Marconi rigged high aspect ratio sloop  But hey, always open to see results, some good A-B-A or boat on boat tests would be nice. 

But I understand usually when someone choses to use Leeboards they usually are not chasing high performance.
