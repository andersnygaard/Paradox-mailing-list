Subject: Paradox in Build

Now that the fine weather has arrived I'm making good progress with 
building my Paradox. For those interested in seeing photographs of some of the latest bits and pieces go to http://www.smallsailboats.co.uk/paradox/con_gallery.htm .

Within a few days I should start assembling the hull. Practically all the other parts have been built.

Bill.
