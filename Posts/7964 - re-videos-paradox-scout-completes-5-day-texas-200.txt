Hey Rob!

Thanks for the message. I'm glad you enjoyed the video...I have fun making and sharing them.

I can tell you that the boat you are about to start building is going to amaze you....It surely has me. I have been sailing for 40 years and I have never sailed anything like Scout. The confidence I have gained in the boat by sailing it in different conditions...is phenomenal. I am so thankful for Matt's design and adventures, and for Dave and Mindy Bolduc for bringing it forward to the world on the internet. Without them, hardly anyone would have ever known of Matt's revolutionary designs. I hope someday to take on some adventures comparable to what they have done...but I'm not sure I am up for it. Matt, Dave, and Mindy are truly in a league of their own...pioneers that have blazed a trail and that has opened a road for many of us to follow.

I will watch your progress as you post it on here with great excitement.

With respect to the yahoogroups.... Long before I came into the Paradoz scene these boards came into being. I find myself wondering why there are two seperate Paradox boards rather than one. Seems to splinter the group up...but there must be something I am unaware of that led to this.

PS here is the latest video that includes a link on the video to Scout's Texas 200 playlist.

A Taste of the Texas 200...just some a quick look at a few parts.... http://youtu.be/E2FqS5u0WXk

And a video that was posted today of Scout and the Texas Ducks arriving in Magnolia Beach on Day 5 (The final destination of the Texas 200). I guess it looks a bit anti-climatic to watch it...but believe me...we were all stoked that we pulled off the whole trip...
