Hello! I am Erik from northeast Ohio I have a Com-Pac 23 sailboat and
sail primarily on Lake Erie. I have been bitten by the Paradox bug and
I am researching building one. My main purpose for building will be to
sail in the Great Lakes/Georgian Bay skinny waters and a Florida to
Bahamas adventure in a couple years (crossing GulfStream of course). I
love the elegant simple design of the Paradox but I am still not 100%
sold on a keel-less boat out in offshore conditions. In an effort to
increase the chance of righting the boat I have been trying to work on
a solution to instill more confidence in the event of a capsize.

You are trying to solve a problem that doesn't exist. Matt has got it 
all sorted. When ballasted according to the plans the boat should 
self-right from 165 degrees. In practice you are never going to be 
out in conditions that would cause that sort of capsize.

Look here <www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9zFRR3M2M0> 
and here <www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHVp7Xxzqf4>

In the first film, my boat, the idea was to measure the load at the 
masthead required to hold it down. The spring balance went way off 
scale.

In short, there is no need to worry about capsize recovery because 
the boat won't capsize. The worst that will happen is a 90-degree 
knock-down, but the boat will be up again before you can do anything.
