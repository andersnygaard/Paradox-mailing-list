It really makes a lot of sense to make permenant at least part of the ballast on a boat that needs to sit on it's lines.  The choice would probably hinge on boat use.  As a local day sailor or short term cruiser I would be seeking a more permanent ballast keeping the inside of the boat uncluttered and avoiding the water and tank maintainance issues; adding water in small containers as needed.  As Dave uses his for 3 months of cruising, I would likely be saving every once for water and food... at least it seems to me.  I can see both veiwpoints pretty well.

Hi Paul,   I prefer to store my water in small containers, the tanks make great storage areas  also. I  have permanent ballast there and don't have use the water as ballast. I have glassed the outside to stop the checking, But there are way to many small pieces to glass on the interior I  believe it would be cheaper to change plywood.

I am curious why you want to eliminate the tanks.

Also, a thin (6 oz or so) glass cloth in epoxy should stop fir ply
from checking.
