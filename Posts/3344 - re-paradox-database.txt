Hi Bill,

You might want to add my name to your list. I would be interested in 
corresponding with any other Paradox builders owners in the Los 
Angeles, California area. Incidentally, I also completed a Selway-
Fisher 50/50 sailing canoe so we appear to share the same taste.

Details of my Paradox are as follows:

She is 90% complete.
No name as of yet.
Follows plans exactly.
Being built in Los Angeles, CA.

I will be sure to send photos in due course. I estimate completion 
by this summer.

Regards,

Mark Waters
