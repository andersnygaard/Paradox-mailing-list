Thanks John for pointing us to those links!

If you go to this URL you will see pictures of the construction and
position of the chine runners - to me they look as if they follow the curve
of the hull side and hull bottom - "sea of peas" again ?

This second URL shows the finished boat being car topped.

Yes they start farther aft and end a little farther forward. No, I think
they work because of end plate effect.

Glen, this is very interesting. Do the runners start further aft on
the new little boat? Do they end before they reach the transom? Do
you think this has any bearing on the theory that they work because of
the curvature of the chine?
