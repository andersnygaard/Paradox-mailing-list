I too have no desire to cross the North Sea (especially in a F9) but to my mind there is one area that Paradox wins out over both Noli and Enigma. I often sum up the advantages of Paradox as 'comfort', but one area of comfort not often mentioned is the comfort of confidence. I often spend the night beached with like-minded souls in more conventional craft. One of the important operations for them is to survey the bottom, where they will dry out, for rocks that could damage the hull. This is something that I just don't have to bother about, the thick bottom board is more than strong enough.

While cruising the West Country last summer with Bill we returned to the boats to find that Faith had dried out on a concrete sinker. The metal ring on the top of the sinker was almost under the balance point with the bows about 3 ft in the air (I don't know why it never occurred to me to take a photo). Bill climbed in and waited for the tide to return. Later when Faith was on her trailer I was unable to see any damage to the bottom.

This general over-construction gives me great confidence that the boat will protect me.

Hoping for calm nights
