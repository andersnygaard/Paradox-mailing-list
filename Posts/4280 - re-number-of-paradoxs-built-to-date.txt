Hi Perry,

You are welcome to see Zoe, I live just south east of Live Oak, FL which is on I-10 about 70 miles east of Tallahassee. I will also be at the Cedar Key small boat gathering the 1st week end in May as will David and his Whisper.

Hi folks,

Has anyone assembled a list of Paradox boats actually built to date? I am getting my information organized to build one. I've never taken on a project of this size. I'd love to see a boat that has been completed before I start work on mine. I live in South Alabama and could travel to see one along the Northern Gulf Coast.

Thanks,

Perry
