I reckon that Rob's advise is spot on. A good bespoke trailer for a Paradox is essential and totally different to a 'normal' boat trailer and it's going to be expensive to get one made for the job.

I designed and made my own trailer and that's an economic way to go if you can. Before then I had a 'normal' one and that was disastrous

I also concur with using.top quality materials. Building a Paradox is a lot of work and it would be a waste of all your huge efforts to build a boat with a short life span made from inferior wood.
