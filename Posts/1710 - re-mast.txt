Wooden Boat issue 149, page 31, which is the July/August 1999 issue. Bird's Mouth Hollow Spars by Aime Ontario Fraser, covering the techniques of Craig Wright and Richard Duke of Mountain Marine.

This is a very good article, and I had built a 6 foot test section. Very easy, even for me, who has really poor woodworking skills. Although I did take an introduction to bandsaw class with Aime Fraser with one of the local woodworkers clubs. She's really into handplanes in the thousands of dollar range!
