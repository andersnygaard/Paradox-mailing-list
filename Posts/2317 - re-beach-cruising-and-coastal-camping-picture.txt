Sorry about your finger, It only takes a moment doesn't it?

I too had trouble with the stem. I had developed the shape in 3dCAD 
and cut it most accurately only to find it needed to be entirely 
different. As a general rule, to all you who haven't got that far 
yet, I would advise leaving all the bevels with excess material on 
until the trial assembly when they can be cut to the correct angle 
(whether this agrees with the plans or not).

For breathing epoxy fumes I use a cartridge filter mask I bought from 
Buck & Hickman (we have a shop on our factory site). The cartridge is 
was recommended by the salesman and is labelled ABEK which I think 
covers inorganic gasses. Using this there was no epoxy smell getting 
through.

Try the B & H site at http://www.buckhickman.co.uk/. I wouldn't be 
surprised if your local tool hire shop couldn't sell you one.

If you get one keep it sealed in a plastic bag when not in use 
otherwise the filter goes on absorbing chemicals from the atmosphere 
and will wear out sooner.

Hoping for calm nights
