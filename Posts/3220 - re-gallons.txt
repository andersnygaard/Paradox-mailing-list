Hi Nels,

I've never been confronted by an American beer although I quite liked 
root beer when Macdonalds used to sell it :0)

I'm fond of Stella Artois and a few obscure English breweries but 
I don't drink much nowadays. I spent 3 years in Europe about 20 Km from 
the Belgian border and have drunk a few Stella. There is a brewery in 
Belgian run by monks that made a brew much better but I can't recall the name then. 
(Hic!)

Kronenburg was the only French beer worth considering and it was 
borderline. I really preferred Lowenbrau, Heidelberg, and Parkbrau 
which was German and available at most NATO air bases. Amstel was an 
excellent Dutch beer but the Danes had the best on the Continent in 
Carlsberg and Becks.

But my favorite all-time libation has to be Murphy's Irish stout 
followed by Beamish - both far superior to Guinness! And either of 
which provided a full balanced meal in a bottle, complete with 
vitamins and minerals. Perfect for a diet at sea :-)
