As a lurker here, it is such a shame that the Paradox "movement" is being damaged by such a bad tempered group.

Don, Please realise that everyone here is very grateful for your advice, but do you have to be so rude to people whose only sin is to have views that differ from your own?.

Stay here, help people and just count to ten when people post views that you personally do not like.

With best wishes

Brian
