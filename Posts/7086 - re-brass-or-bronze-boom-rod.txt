Subject: Re: Brass or Bronze Boom Rod

Recently there were posts about the making of the boom swivel. I can't find the posts that tell what kind of metal rod was used.

I am needing to make mine, and want to get something that can be easily bent. Could someone help me find these posts?

I replied to that post,

It wasnt that long ago, should be up near the top. Best is prob bronze, Stainless steel prob pretty good too. brass I fear maybe to brittle, brass likes to crack when under stress. I think the guy that asked last time was using brass, I guess time will tell if its well suited. there are pic's in the folder. the problem with things that are easily bent is, that they unbend easy too.
