There is a little ditty that goes with the words PORT and STARBOARD. It 
goes; "IS THERE ANY RED PORT WINE LEFT?" So this way it helps you 
remember that the red running light goes to the left side of the hull, 
called PORT and the green running light goes on the right side called 
STARBOARD. When your tired and maybe seasick and maybe a little scared, 
all these little things are a help, at least it has been for me. Good 
Luck, Steve Yahn

On the east side of the pond we can append the words IN THE CAN to 
indicate the shape of the buoys.

Hoping for calm nights
