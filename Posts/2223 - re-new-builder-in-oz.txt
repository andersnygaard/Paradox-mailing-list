Sorry, mate. Guess I'm one of those people who thinks "if all else
fails read the instructions". I just assumed that the plans wouldn't be
in metric. Hope your building goes well and I'll be very interested to
hear about the progress, as I'm sure will the rest of the group.
All the best
Shane
p.s. Are you opting for exterior grade or marine ply?

Hi Shane,

My plans are already in metric. Makes it much easier as I don't think
in 
feet and inches.
I didn't specify metric plans though, I thought that was standard for
Paradox.

There is an easy conversion program for free at 
http://www.joshmadison.com/software/convert/.
This converts most units into whatever you want and it's pretty
small.

Sounds like the Aussie fleet is growing.
