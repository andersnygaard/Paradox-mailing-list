Hi DC,

When I got to the runners I found that all three dimensions were changing over the entire length of run so to make the task easier I made foot long blocks to rough shape and glued them to the ply bottom extension. It took very little time to do this with a band saw and once complete, only minor fairing was required with a mini grinder and 24 grit disk.

I am now thinking that a mold made from a section of the chine runner and then used to cast lead for ballast would be a good idea to get the ballast out of the bilge and out farther on the lever arm. The lead could be bolted (hardware bonded) to the chine log. Just a thought.

Tailwinds

Glen
