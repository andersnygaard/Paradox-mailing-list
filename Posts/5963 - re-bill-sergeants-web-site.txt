Subject: Re: Bill Sergeants web site

Does anyone know what happened to Bill's website? I just tried to access it from the links page within the group and also tried it manual... no response.. is it down temp or gone for good?

Bill has closed the website down. He gave 3 months notice of this in January, and it closed at the end of March.
