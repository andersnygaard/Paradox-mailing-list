Hello Nels,

How much current do you have flowing past your place ??

JG

It's not too bad here, along the upper South Thompson, although we have just passed flood stage so you can hear the water swirling around the bridge pilings, maybe 4-5 MPH. You can paddle where the walking path is behind the shore willows - it is like a little canal:-)

If you google earth using my postal code (V0E 2P0) you can view the location. (The "0's" are zeroes  for those not aware of Canadian postal codes.) Click on the blue dot in the middle of the bridge and a photo appears. It is a really funky one-lane bridge and has a boat launch at each end. I live downstream about a five minute walk along River Road on the north shore.

The water is pretty swift around Banana Island upstream and then you get to Little Shuswap Lake and the river section between it and the main Lake has some grade 1-2 rapids for a bit.

There are two concrete boat launches at Chase and an non-secure public marina and parking area.  A private marina is just on the right of where the upper part of the river begins.

Downstream from here - at Kamloops - the North Thompson joins and they have whitewater rafting on the river, further downstream.

That's pretty impressive.  I didn't realise Google Earth was so revealing.  You sure live in a fascinating part of the world, and I note that the sort of boating you do needs to be tailored to the type of water available.

While I'm about it, I want to thank your for the many valuable contributions you make to several Yahoo boating groups, not least smallsailboats, my own forum.

Thank you,
Bill.
