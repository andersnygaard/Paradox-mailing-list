Subject: Re: Sail

Hi Ron and everyone else,

My sail was built by Sails Etc. in St. Augustine. Their phone number is 904-810-1966. While I'm not 100 percent satisfied, I'm about 85-90 percent satisfied and the price I quoted was high. When I pulled out the receipt, I found the cost to be $420, so according to the costs coming over the wire, I guess it was a pretty good deal after all. If anyone orders a sail from them, I would recommend requiring that the sail be made exactly as drawn and detailed in the plans. They took some liberties with mine, mainly at the tack fitting, and it irked me a little. The sail has actually performed very well, but I'm a stickler for details and on some points of sail, mainly off the wind, a slight wrinkle develops in light air and I find it annoying. Maybe it's my trimming, but I don't think so. The good news is I was told if there were any problems to bring it back and they would adjust it, so I'm waiting to see if anything else develops before returning it. It was delivered on time and at an agreed-upon price. I believe it is 4.5 oz. British cloth.

Tailwinds,
Glen
