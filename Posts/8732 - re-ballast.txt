'WINTER IS COMING AND SO IS THE THOR' headline by dreadful punster in the Couriermail (Qld tabloid), referring to Chris Hemsworth not Nick Bell. Hemsworth is Thor in THOR (2nd instalment) to be shot on the Gold Coast about 60k sth of where I'm seated at the mome (Dunwich Historical Museum Nth Stradbroke Island). Don't fret Nick, the guy ttying to steal your thunder only made page 25. Hollywood would love your name, storyline in minimum syllables.

Apart from tools, spare cordage, some thihn ply for making an emergency patch and epoxy glue, having nice stuff to eat and drink is pretty essential.

Enjoy yourself Nick.

Hi Jim , I'm about to leave one for a while to sail
in better weather , a long way from home , is there any
advice from your experience as to what to pack , repair
equipment etc ? I have plenty of space in my truck, that
I'll be towing the boat with ..mostly day sailing ,
but some overnights ..planned or otherwise ..I'm thinking to
take resin and a few tools and spares for the outboard motor
, ( Honda 2.3 air cooled ) Any advice would be
welcomed

Hi Eeric

Thanks for quoting my concerns, but since your Paradox is
larger than standard the tendency for tenderness may not be
such a big issue as I think it would be for my regular
sized one.

There are a few issues for my regular Paradox sail

. Often when I roll some of it up for reefing in stronger
winds it unfortunately doesn't roll up on the boom
evenly, but with creases at luff and leach, which ruins the
sail shape and increases local stress.

Also when sailing on Port tack for a long time with a reefed
sail it chafes against the mast enough to make a few tiny
holes after a time.

Stephen,

What is meant by having a little stress on junk sail is that each panel acts as a single sail, due to its battens being additional "booms". Therefore the each sail has very small area and bears smaller stresses (comparing to lugsail having full sail area just between boom and yard). On contrary, Jim has expressed concern that the junksail may be too heavy, and tilt the boat too much; due to having many heavy battens, and also the extra sail cloth for forming camber. Hopefully we'll see...

Regards,
Eerik

Oops!
Just thought of something worrying about marrying a junk rig with a Paradox. The lugsail (being a big powerful lug of a thing) tilts the Paradox over to that audacious angle enabling the chine-runners to do their thing. Am I right so far? The junk rig is as aerodynamically efficient but unaccompanied by the 'lug of a thing' power lugsails and other 'western' sails possess. Junksail are famous for how little stress is exerted upon the rig, resulting in a lot of money saved not having to pay for wear ans tear and the expensive cloth and construction required in lug/bermuda sails. So the junksailed Paradox stands upright and goes really well sideways, the chine-runners never being properly employed. It would be good if this assumption is wrong. But if this is the problem Matt twigged to it a couple of decades ago.
