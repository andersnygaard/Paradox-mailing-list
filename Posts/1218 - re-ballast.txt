I'm starting to think about what I want to do for ballast. As drawn, I can use smallish pig lead, outboard of the tanks. I'm also considering the possibility of lead as part of the chine runners, such as Glen has mentioned. As I'm just in the mulling about stage, I haven't yet gotten to figure out what the lead in this configuration would weigh (at most).

Use lead birdshot and mix it with epoxy and enough silica filler to make a putty like mixture (thick!).  Apply it to the chine runner and use a rounded shape to give it a radius.

I may apply this type of mixture on the hull bottom exterior as a base under glass mat and cloth.  Can't get ballast weight much lower than that! 

I expect that you could add between 100 and 200 lbs lead in the chine runners and on the bottom. The rest can be interior lead pigs, or my preference, sand bags. I prefer to limit any skin contact with lead and do not want it with me in my cabin.
