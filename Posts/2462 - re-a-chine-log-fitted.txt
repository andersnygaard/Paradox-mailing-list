Hi Derek,

I don't seem to quite follow you here. Seems to me 25 mm nails would 
go right through wouldn't they? Obviously I am missing something - 
besides the brain cells I mean:-)

This illustrates nicely the problem of living with metric but raised on Imperial. I was 
thinking half inch and somehow converted it to 25mm which is one inch! Doh! Not your 
brain cells at all, but mine. I teach metric measurement in school and think that it is much 
simpler than Imperial , but I just can't stop thinking in Imperial. Our money has been 
metrified for the best part of 30 years and I still convert to =A3. s. d. to see what things are 
'really' costing.

Peter Lenihan used nails or screws as clamping devices, since you can "fine tune" the amount of pressure applied between the two layers. And then removed the screws afterwards.

Sounds a good idea. I'll use stainless and leave a few in; belt and braces :0)

How thick should a line of epoxy be for a good joint? It would be easy to rout to 9mm and then take out to the depth for the glue line while leaving a few ridges at 9mm to ensure that the glue can't be squeezed too thin.

Cheers   
Derek
