Subject: Starting my Paradox build questions.
Date: 13 Nov 2014 02:53:11 -0800

Hello,

I am starting to cut wood on my Paradox and had a couple of questions. Thanks in advance for any help or advice you have for me. 

- Should the transom sides be curved? 
- Are there any issues with epoxying wood strips after they have been steamed to bend them? My concern is with moisture content of the wood before adding epoxy. I am using Douglas fir lumber cut into strips for the deck beams.  
- What is the side cleat size for bulkhead #4?
