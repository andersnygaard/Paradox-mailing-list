I've just had calamity number two with my boom axle (all part of learning) and noticed that my boom has adopted a curve in two planes. I've decided to ignore it. Once it's in the sail sleeve it may not show:0)

How would you suggest the yard should be modified to minimize sag, at best to eliminate it?

I hadn't actually noticed any sag on my yard (but then I haven't been looking), but it would certainly be easy to increase the depth of the yard to make it stiffer. 

If an estimate could be made of how much it is bending, a yard could be made with that much initial bend (in the opposite direction) so in use it was straight.
