Hi Paul,

Yes I am interested! I contacted Don twice to order them, along with 
a couple of other articles of his, and never heard anything back from 
him on how to pay for them. It was mainly the Paradox articles I was 
wanting, but he also has a set on building Caretopper and on 
constructing taped seams that seems really well done.

Let me know what you want for them. I am in Canada so there is extra 
postage involved, probably about $5 US (I will pay you $20 US Cash if 
I can get them.)
