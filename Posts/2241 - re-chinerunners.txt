Now I remember! In "Beachcruising and Coastal Camping" Matt talks of a knockdown in Swampthing.

On page 94 Warren Bailey commented on Matt's design:

"Back in '35, Key West sponging dingies had about a 4-inch radius on their chine protrusions, called a "knuckle-V". I made a cruising sailboat of one of these, and was amazed  at the way she'd surf sideways in a breaker-wouldn't trip over as ordinary hard chine boats did. Nowadays this relieved chine is called a non-trip chine; which you may want to consider in the light of your capsize while surfing sideways"

"A couple of years later , Matt sailed out to the Bahamas in his next boat. ... and the chines are gently radiused"
