Hi Nick

I've been sailing mine for a while now - this will be my 8th year - and I'm still learning how.
So take heart.

Best
Jim

Great advice thank you
I was wondering if I was missing something. Seems my experience is nothing unusual. I'm tempted to mess things up and got a Bermuda rig just to see what would happen. A triangular main and a jib. For the moment though I'm going to sail as much as I can in warm climes.
Happy sailing
Nick

* There's less thumping when the boat is sailing heeled.
Being towed to windward would be like motoring with an outboard. The boat is more level and with more pounding then.

"I was wondering if the blog could include sailing
tips...Sail setting tips...especially in stronger head winds and getting caught in irons when tacking (More foreword ballast has helped that, I think? I added a tractor battery, a big one into compartment two, ahead of the mast.)"


Getting around a tack while in rough water is a slow and uncertain process........Sometimes a few strokes from the yuloh gives the extra drive required to get the bow onto the next heading.   Sometimes a gybe is more effective.

Ojn my boat with its present sail, both tacks are pretty evenly effective to windward , although
