Hi Greg.

I wish I had just put NOLI's photos up on the site. But the sun has been out nearly all day though it is still cold, especially in the shade at the back of my house where she resides.

Its funny.
I covered NOLI up at the end of October and uncovered her this Saturday afternoon to check her over. 
I left her uncovered during the night under my lean-too as it was due to be fine. So I thought.
Sunday morning about 7am in my slumber I thought I heard it rain but ignored it.
I woke up to it snowing!
Go figure.
Someone up there has a sense of humour.
