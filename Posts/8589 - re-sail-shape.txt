Sanding off and fairing the glass bottom ain't much fun in the heat of summer, so my build has stopped for a day or two.

By the way, I did quite of lot of research and concluded that woven roving is now considered old technology (and almost impossible to find in NZ), so instead of the plans recommendation of 4mm glass to be achieved by:

3 * 24oz woven roving OR 3 * 2oz mat + 1 * 24oz woven roving 

I went with 2 * 400gm (14oz) bi-axial cloth

The guy in the shop seemed to think, I would get 2mm+ per layer, but it looks more like 1.5mm, so I've ended up with 3mm rather than the recommended 4mm.  Bi-axial cloth is supposed to be much stronger than woven roving because the long fibers are laid on top of each other rather than being woven together which reduces their strength (similar to tying a knot in a rope which reduces its strength by 50%), so hopefully what I've done will be OK.

There's a discussion about the virtues of bi-axial cloth here:

Dave's wiki / Biaxial fiberglass notes https://aiki.pbworks.com/w/page/1594282/Biaxial%20fiberglass%20notes 

Woven cloth weaves bundles of fibers over and under one another. This is the same weave you typically see if in a table cloth, or wicker basket.
