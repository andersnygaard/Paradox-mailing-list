Subject: Re: Trailer

I could find no commercial trailer that would fulfil my needs so ended up designing my own (pictures on my web site, address below). It has generally been very successful and allows me to launch and recover single handed without significant physical effort.

The drawback is that I need a proper slipway that I can get a car to.

It is very docile on the road behind my 2 litre diesel car. This car is fine except on the odd steep slipway, when getting started can use a lot of clutch.

My main requirement was that the trailer wheels should not get wet so the trailer acts as a launching ramp putting the the boat into water deep enough for it to float. While doing this it puts considerable upward force on the towball so the towbar arrangement on the car needs to be strong enough to take this.

Hoping for calm nights
