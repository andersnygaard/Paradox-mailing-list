Hi Al,

Well at long last I've started to make some progress again on the boat.
It's been a long cold winter for boat building and I've found it hard to get motivated into starting off where I left off last year! I'm busy preparing the hull for sheathing, which I hope to start very soon. There are still 1001 jobs to do and the list never seems to get any shorter. I'm still hopeful she may be finished this year as long as other commitments don't get in the way. I've volunteered to do a sponsored cycle ride with work at the end of June, and i'm busy doing the route planning for that (650 miles). I'm also supposed to be organising training rides for participants which eats away at my weekend building time! Still it'll be all worth it in the end (http://www.justgiving.com/itservices if anyone would like to put a few pence to a good cause).

Are you and LJ attending Beale Park this year? I hope to get along and see some of the other builders handywork.

Update on progress at my blog http://www.freewebs.com/paradoxbuild/apps/blog/

Cheers
Pete
