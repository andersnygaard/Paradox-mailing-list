Canoests regularly go upstream on fast rivers and have done so myself. How much HP can you put out with a paddle? Generally the average paddler about 1/10 HP over time I believe. Working the eddies is the trick.

Trying to recharge a deep cycle battery with a solar panel will lessen it's life as well as does over-draining it.  I use AGM's which are not as prone to sulfation and stratification as flooded cell ones. But a smart charger is worth the price.

A lot of boaters were I live have one of these for added lift when applying more power than the boat requires.

Or for prop protection near the shore one of these.

But the majority have added a bigger motor and just pour on the coal going upstream:-) Never seen any electric trolling motors out there so maybe I am biased. I have given it some thought but a lack of shore recharging is an issue where I am. So have a 1500 watt portable genset - which as I mentioned - just find to be a pain to care for and listen to. Plus I prefer to anchor in a quiet out of the spot.
