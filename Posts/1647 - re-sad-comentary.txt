I guess it’s not a big deal. I can understand if one was to use lesser grade plywood and not using the epoxies and bonding fillers of today; it’s a cheap and effective way to hold the laminates together. Should the glue let go, also if one does not use epoxy to seal all wood and using regular paint, it could become an issue. It is easy enough to replace with flat heads and washer nut, and trim to hide it. Nails tend to move and break the seal of epoxy, then the water gets in.
