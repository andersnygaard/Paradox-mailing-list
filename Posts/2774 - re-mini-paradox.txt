Yes they start farther aft and end a little farther forward. No, I think they work because of end plate effect.

Glen, this is very interesting. Do the runners start further aft on the new little boat? Do they end before they reach the transom? Do you think this has any bearing on the theory that they work because of the curvature of the chine?
