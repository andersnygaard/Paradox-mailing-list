Subject: Re: Ladikan launched at last

Hello Bengt,

My name is Glenn Lundstrom. This morning I red your mail about the successful launching of your mini-cruiser D=E4nikan. It made made my day, but I got so carried away that I responded in Swedish. I'm sorry lads, but it will not happen again.

I plan to start building my own Paradox shortly. I was born and raised in Vasteras, on the western shore of lake Malaren. I spent most of my working-life at sea, but not as a carpenter. I'm 67 years old, but I'm in quite good shape for the time being.

Right now I live in Vara - a small place right in the middle of a farming community. But Lake Vanern, the greatest lake of Sweden is not fare away. My plan is to sail my future Paradox there. A great area for sailing - just like lake Malaren.

I hope to hear from you Bengt. Probably I'll need some good advice while building my own mini-cruiser. I wish you fair wind and happy sailing with D=E4nikan.

Greetings
Glenn L.
