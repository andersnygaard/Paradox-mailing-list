Subject: Re: Great Lugsail Article


I'd call the Paradox sail a version of a standing lug. Strictly as 
far as my experience is concerned a standing lug has the tack 
attached to the mast, however whatever works is ok. In this case the 
tack is not actually attached to the mast but is very close to it. A 
balanced lug normally has more of the sail in front of the mast. The 
rig as designed allows the sail to be roller reefed and furled by 
slacking the halyard and hauling in on the reefing/furling line 
(refurling??) Other ways of reefing will need more line or lines and 
be less adjustable. Since finding Paradox recently I have tried to 
come up with a better idea but so far this seems the best, easiest, 
most fool proof.  Well done Matt.
