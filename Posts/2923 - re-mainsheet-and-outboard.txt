Hi Nels,

Even back in the 17 and 1800's the authorities were trying to disband them 
because they drank to excess and bust up wherever they were. 

Oh OK - Nowadays they ride on dirt bikes, quads, snowmobiles, and jetskis:-)

So if you wanted to take your Paradox across the channel to explore some of the canals on the continent how would you go? 
Would you sail or tow it over through the Chunnel? Is there any boat traffic back and forth that way - or on the ferries?
