There are many ways to look at this. The protected steering position in the Paradox does a lot to reduce fatigue and general exposure to weather. This is a big plus. The skipper stays warm and safe.

Having been out just today, I am again amazed at how well the boat takes care of herself with minimum fuss and input from the skipper.

I have a junk rig which can be dropped in seconds into lazyjacks where it is out of harms way.

All of these are related to staying safe and avoiding extreme situations.

The other Paradox in Western Australia has been rolled over in breaking waves in shallow water. A lot of damage resulted but the boat was salvaged and repaired.

Positive buoyancy is important. I don't have foam, but rather rely on a number of plastic containers tied in place. Not that I have anything against foam, just thought it was going to be a bit too complicated for my skill levels.

And last one from me is - stay out of tight situations, always try to keep open water around you and plan ahead.
