Subject: Re: Propane powered outboards !

Thanks for the link. But that review is so full of holes it's inspired me to write up my own blog entry on LPG vs Gasoline. I'm in the market and just blew past these LPG outboards as just the latest suckers bet:) His only valid point is they are slightly cleaner, but he ignores the economics completely. I've traveled thousands of mile with gasoline and have a very different opinion than his. But then he spent the money now needs to justify the choice I suppose:)

A friend uses one on his WW Potter and likes it. His review:

From: Edward 
Since propane has less energy/gal(about 91K BTU) than a gallon of gas(about 116K BTS) and I pay locally(Maine) $3.15/gal for Propane and $3.48/gal for gas.... well doesn't seem like such a great idea it me:) Then Defender wants $1730 for a Lehr 5hp while a Tohatsu 5hp will fetch $1212 really makes me wonder about the economics. But hey based on Taxing policy YMMV:)
