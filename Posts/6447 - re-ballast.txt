The 180 kg of ballast that calls the plane, we must subtract water ballast?

I've tried sailing my boat with various weights. I tend to go heavier when cruising, 100kg lead, plus a battery of about 30kg, anchor, food, water, etc. This usually puts my boat down on her lines somewhat by the time I'm on board, but I've noticed no adverse effect on sailing. However, I do notice that with extra weight she responds to gusts more slowly, and is extremely comfortable at anchor even if the anchorage is a bit ordinary.

Cheers,
