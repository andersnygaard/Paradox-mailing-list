Subject: Re: Mast is offset?

I am in the process of building a paradox here in British Columbia, called Bye Bye love. I don't think that you need to worry much about the mast being offset a little bit.After all you out to see some of the late Phil Bolger's boats.He got offset centerboards incluiding radical mast and stern arrangments. if you can live with the looks the boats function just fine! On my project I eliminated the vent box. I just plane and simply needed all the room that I could get.
