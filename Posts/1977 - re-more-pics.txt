Subject: Re: More pics

Great pics, but can you please upload pics to the files folders? The large pics that you post can only be viewed in a smaller resolution, that only the group moderator can see full sized. For instance in one of the pics:
Screen Size: 19 KB   |  Full Size: 366 KB

All we can see is the 19kb size, so there is an additional 347 kb we will never see, and sorely miss :(
Thanks,
Paul

Surely, I am no net-wizard (actually, I've asked my Darling Digital Daughter to help me for a some weeks, but alas... the younger generation is utterly occupied). When I started the uploading, I ran out of space, Yahoo told me. I thought it was my fault that the photos dept. was nearly filled up, so I deleted almost all of my full-size pics and then at least the rest worked. Let's see if Glen is can do something about it. Otherwise, if there is a particular pic you want full-size, please let me know. Perhaps there is space for one or two.
