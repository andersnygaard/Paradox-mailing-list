Subject: Glass bottom Paradox?

The flat bottom and Dave and Mindy's accounts of sailing through shallow waters full of coral and tropical fish have me thinking: could the bottom of a Paradox be made transparent? Obviously, the storage compartments and water tanks are in the way, and the water tanks can't be shifted without rethinking the entire boat.

But perhaps the bottom under the storage compartments could be transparent, and the stored items moved out of the way and the floorboard taken up when viewing? Would plexiglass or thick plastic be strong enough structurally? Would it get horribly scratched when you pulled up on the beach? Is there a good reference somewhere to the engineering properties of transparent materials?

Alternatively, perhaps both the bottom and the storage compartment covers/water tank tops could be transparent, allowing visibility even with the floorboards in place. The obvious problem would be the risk of collision due to gawking at the marine life instead of watching where you're going....
