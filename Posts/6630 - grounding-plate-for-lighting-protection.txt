Subject: grounding plate for lighting protection

Glen, or anybody else who can help,

I noticed on Zoe that the copper plate on the bottom was attached with a vac-bag. I would like to put this plate on my boat but do not understand the process. Could someone please describe the process for attaching this plate or inform me as to where I may find this information?

Thank-you,
Rod
