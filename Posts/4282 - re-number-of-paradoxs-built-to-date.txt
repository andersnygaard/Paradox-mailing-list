Subject: Re: Number of Paradox's built to date


It's good to see you are back on the water with your faithful West 
Wight Potter and that you have planned adventures for this season.

I'll be keeping an eye on your blog.  Blogs are really good for 
keeping a daily diary online while cruising if one has something like 
a Vodafone card and a laptop computer.  A couple of years ago I used 
mine to advantage while cruising to the Scilly Isles so that my 
relatives and friends could be kept up to date with my news.  Within 
12 miles of the UK coast Vodafone has good reception.

The blog I use is

http://bills-log.blogspot.com/  Somewhere in the archives my 2 months 
log lays dormant waiting for anyone who may wish to read it. (Unless 
it has been deleted by the host ISP)

Paradox will be a different boat altogether from the Potter, although 
yours has a junk rig sail which must make for easy handling.

Best wishes,
Bill.
