Glen:

Do you mind if I use this tip in Duckworks Magazine?  I wish I had known about this before, although, I have not had a problem in the past with bottom paint.  I did have the paint on the topsides of my Tennessee come off in sheets after a day or two in salt water.  This was not more than a week after she was painted.

One question:  do you use the last coat like a primer, in other words, can you put it right over cured, sanded epoxy?
