Hi Steven,

You are going to be surprised how little these long narrow boats roll to begin with. When I started sailing "Zoe" I was amazed with the lack of rolling off the wind. Later when I sailed across the Atlantic with Chris Morejohn the same was true aboard his "Hogfish Maximus". I sold on offshore voyaging in these modified sharpies.

The mast is solid inside because it is such a small mast. I think a more massive mast may have a slower roll from side to side for the boat on the whole.
