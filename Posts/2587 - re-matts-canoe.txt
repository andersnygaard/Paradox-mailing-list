I don't have any plans for the canoe, nor have I had an opportunity 
to see it in person since I haven't been to Matt's house in about 2 
years.  However, I did talk to Matt about it 2 weeks ago, and he was 
very optimistic about this car toppable boat. He told me that he can 
actually sleep and cook aboard this 14' Rob Roy based design, which 
is amazing considering it only has a 28 inch beam. I guess I'll have 
to try it out for myself some time. Oh yeah, he also told me that he 
originally steered it by just shifting his weight around; however, 
he recently added a "trim tab" to improve it's control. Judging by 
his progress in this year's Everglades Challenge, the little canoe 
seems to be doing quite well. So far Matt has gone through cp3 (mile 
273) in 3d, 16h, 12 min, and he has only 30 miles to go. This comes 
out to 3.1 knots average speed including rest stops.
