Subject: Re: sailmakers

Hi all,

I asked a renowned sailmaker here in Stockholm to make up one paradox sail. For that he wanted 12000 SEK, which is about 2.5 times what you guys have paid. Wasn't it 500 USD some of you have reported? Do you have a mail-address to this sailmaker by any chance?

I bought some SEK yesterday and I think it was about 6 SEK to the USD. So that would make your price 4 times the US price would it not? (2000 USD) It is not really that complicated to sew your own, I would suggest.

Cheers,
