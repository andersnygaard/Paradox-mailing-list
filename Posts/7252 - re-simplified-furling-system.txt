Subject: Re: simplified furling system?

I found the bending of this rod to be very simple. I held it in a vise. I heated the bend area with an oxy-acetylene torch and easily bent it to a nice curve with a wrench. I made mine from stainless steel because I had it on hand. I too have a topping lift. I only need it to assist in the furling/reefing work. It is a fore and aft by way of a y and a single line up the mast and down into the cabin. 
The tackstrop prevents the boom lifting too far and is also needed to help hardening the luff. It also helps hold the furled boom into its place on the portside deck when stowed. It also is needed as an anchoring point for the fairleader of the reefing/furling line. The Paradox tackstrop, as designed, is in my opinion, a piece of design "genius" in all that it accomplishes so simply.
