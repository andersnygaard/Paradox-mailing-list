Subject: Re: [paradoxsailboat] hatch, bolts or screws

I was taught by a boat builder to overdrill the size of a screw hole. Then back fill the hole with epoxy to create a plug in the wood. Then redrill the hole to the correct size, that way rot won't start at the holes for fittings. It seems like a lot of work, but I'm used to it and it doesn't seem like an inconvenience now. Screws into a boat will create rot if not done this way. My boat is watertight and rot-free several years after launching it.

Here is the deck before and after filling holes with epoxy. I bolted the deck on, removed the bolts when dry and backfilled holes. No metal in wood anywhere on the boat.

The reason bolts are always better than screws is in case water eventually finds its way around the bolt or screw (almost always with time unless careful maintenance). With a bolt, the water drips inside the boat and you know you have a problem which can be fixed easily before the wood rots. With a screw, the water does not go through, and just sits there inside the wood causing rot, then you have to change the entire piece instead of just resealing the hole. Worse, the screw releases its hold at the most inopportune moment, Murphy's law. I have learned to use bolts, as Matt probably did long ago too.

Hope this helps.
