Subject: Re: ballast placement

Hi Peter

Confusing ain't it?  The way to look at it is that the
ballast is fixed to the structure of the boat and  so
acts in a way as if it was central. Another way to
look at it is that the centre of gravity would be in
the middle if you had two equal weights the same
distance from the middle of the boat.
Get it?

Which gets me thinking...what if you did away with the
internal lumps of lead ballast and instead fitted a
large sheet of galvanised sheet steel to the entire
underside of the bottom plywood. .......

You would gain space inside , add extra abrasion
protection to the bottom, possibly save some money
(lead is very expensive now)...save on epoxy too?

Naturally you would have to calculate the thickness of
metal  required to make up the weight specified for
ballast by the designer, wouldn't you? 
Or just maybe not. Perhaps the fact that the metal
plate was fixed at the lowest possible place - a
tiddly bit lower than the 'normal' internal ballast
would allow you a little  discount due to the
advantage of the greater righting moment.

what do you think?
