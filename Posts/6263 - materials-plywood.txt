Subject: Materials - Plywood

I have seen a few early, early posts mention the poor choice of ACX for the hull panels (something about checking, and being unable to avoid it). Should I go with the higher grade marine ply for the hull (bottom, sides and deck)?

Is there anyone who, with regret, used plywood that wasn't up for the task?
