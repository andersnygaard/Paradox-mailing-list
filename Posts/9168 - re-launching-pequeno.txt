Subject: Re: Launching Pequeno

Congrats, AF.

You are the man when it comes to having things in pairs; now you really have a pair-o'-doxes.

Glad to hear you made the launch. Fantastic. You have beautiful lakes as I remember them to be.

The items I have to complete in order to sail with you are the following:

1) Paint the boom
2) Sand the primer paint and paint the rudder block
3) Sand the primer and paint the rudder
4) Finish fairing, then prime paint, and paint the cabin hatch
5) Prime and paint the cabin rails 
6) Put everything back together
7) Get sail and test out with new lines
8) Float the boat - see what happens

The above will get me out on the water.  Hope to get going soon. I work on these items in between other boat projects (gel coating cat ketch, and gorfnik builds)

Anyone interested in sailing in Central New York late summer, please feel free to reach out to me.

Fair winds,

Deric
