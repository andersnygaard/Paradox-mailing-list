Brent,

Here are my responses to your questions:

- Is a continuous/piano hinge used on stateroom sole hatch, just like the cabin sole hatches, or standard hinges?
I've made all my hinges up from webbing and copper tacks and left out the "stateroom" divider. I couldn't imagine lifting anything over it while laying on my side. I put a floor right across, hinged down the middle with the port side fixed and starboard side lifting. I left out the bin in that compartment and so have storage on the floor across the full width and beneath the floor.

- How are the shelves mounted (I'm assuming) the bin sides?
I've made mine separate from the bin sides with their own lip.

- I don't at all understand how the "metal angle" is used in the "galley module" picture. Could you possibly explain that to me?
Is this something important I've left out?

Best,
Derek
