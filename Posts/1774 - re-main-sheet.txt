From the picture in Sailing Magazine(June 2003, p68), it appears to run through a hole in the transom into the hull just to port of the upper rudder pintle. At first glance it is to starboard in the picture, but I believe the picture is reversed, The sheet appears to chafe some against the upper rudder pintle in the photo. All of these observations are confirmed on p70 except the chafe - Matt is demonstrating the yuloh in that picture.

I would have thought it was quite a handful rigged like that.

Where did the sheet go? Through the as-designed fairlead, or through another fairlead between the as-designed and the fixed end?
