Hi Robb.

The guy you are talking about can be found here :-
http://www.amateurboatbuilding.com/articles/howto/sculling_oar/index.html

This is the type of yuloh I am at present making for NOLI with a few mods, just for the sake of it.

I liked this new type of yuloh because I suffer from weak, wrists caused by my first job in a boatyard, straight from school, of "holding on" during clenching copper nails while planking a 46 foot motor sailer.

Half the time I don't think I was on the right nail anyway.
Happy days :-(

I think Matt had trouble with his wrists after the Ultimate through all the sculling he did.
His yuloh looked just like an ordinary oar with a bend in it.
Any thoughts Dave?
