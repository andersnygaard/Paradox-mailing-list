Hi All,

Al, for ventilation I have added another 12 v fan to Whisper, That makes two, One mounted permanently and one with a clip and long cord so I can move it around, it seems to work ok. I will know later on this summer for sure. Whisper does not have the port in the transom, I have thought about rigging up a small exhaust port with some PVC pipe and a computer fan to see if that would help any. ( the computer fan is Dave and Mindys Idea).

I have tried several outboards on Whisper, You have to be careful about the weight, It will affect the sailing a lot. I was running a 65 lb OB and could not arrange ballast enough to offset it. I added a lot of extra weight and it did not help. I went to the two hp Honda at 27 lbs short shaft it works great !!! does not effect the trim (much) you can offset it real easy and will push Paradox at 4.5 knots at 1/2 throttle, and fuel consumption is minimal. Good Motor !!!

As for my post on outboards, I think it was misunderstood.(understandable, my writing stinks). My point was, outboards do not take the place of knowledge and seamanship. I was going offshore thinking that if anything happened I could depend on the outboard to get me home. It was very  wrong for me to think that. Still learning!

I would love to some photos of the interior of LJ.
