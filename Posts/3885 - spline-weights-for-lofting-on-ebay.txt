Subject: Spline weights for lofting on Ebay

To: paradoxbuilders@yahoogroups.com

For those of you who might need a set of lead ducks to hold your
battens down while lofting, I just wanted to point out a set on Ebay
item # 110025009760 .  I got a set of six spline weights from this guy
(no relation whatsoever), and they were pretty nice for the money. 
They are 6 1/4" long, weigh about 3 1/2 pounds and the lead is covered
in a thick plastic coating.  The bottoms are pretty flat (though not
perfect), and a threaded hole is tapped in the front for a hook that
you need to provide. I paid only $21.06 for the set during my auction,
but I've seen some bidders go as high as $60, which I think is way too
much. On the other hand, you could also make your own set. There are
even some plans on how to do it at
http://www.splineweights.com/makeyourown.htm for $3.50 .
