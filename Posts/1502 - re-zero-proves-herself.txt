Hi Guys,

Just reporting on my first passage in Zero across the open section of Moreton Bay. My last comment is that in real life Zero is the prettiest most beautifully proportioned boat in the water - much better than photos can show.

Sorry no sailing photos yet however I am sending some deck photos to Bill for his site.

Until next time.

Glad you had a good time. Thanks for the photos. They are now available at http://www.btinternet.com/~w.serjeant/paradox/zero.htm.

Cheers,
Bill.
