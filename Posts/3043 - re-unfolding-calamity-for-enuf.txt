Subject: Re: Unfolding Calamity for Enuf

Thanks for this David.

I did try neat hardener on a test patch and it still didn't set. I also tried a good mix on top of 
the problem and that set but didn't adhere to the sticky underneath. On my rudder blade I 
applied some mat to the tacky stuff and a good mix squeeged through the mat, and that 
seems to have set ok.

I have just started stripping with a scraper and the tacky coating with its fairing powder is 
coming away like skin off a burn. Great long strips that fold back on the scraper like 
butterscotch toffee.
