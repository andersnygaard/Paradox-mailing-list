Subject: Re: The Classic Paradox Boat "Zoe" Destroyed in Transport

Mark, I'm so sorry for your loss. I personally have been aboard ZOE and she really was an incredible boat. Glen did an amazing job of building and refining her, and it really is a tragic loss.  The only advice I can make now is that you don't abandon your dream and that you continue looking for another Paradox or Layden designed cruiser. They do pop up from time to time, and I'll let you know if I see anything. Your idea of getting another one made also sounds reasonable. It might be a good idea to get some construction quotes from some professional builders like Glen to present to the insurance company.   
Best of luck,
Dave
