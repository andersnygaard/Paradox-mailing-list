Subject: Got my plans today

What a joyous and frightening moment. I am really looking forward to sinking my teeth into this project, and at the same time am terrified of it.

Just a little history about me. My name is Adolf nickname Alf. I am 37 years old. Aside from spending time in a 14 foot fishing boat, I have no boating experience. Have never been in a sailboat. For whatever reason, about a year ago, the idea of sailing came to me. And in a year, it has almost become an obsession.

Starting looking for plans and stumbled onto the Paradox design. I have 6 years of carpentry and cabinet making experience so I hope this will be an advantage. 

Any grains of wisdom would be greatly appreciated.

Regards, 
Alf
