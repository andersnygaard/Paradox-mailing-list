Subject: built in toilets

I'm moving closer to taking the plunge and starting a build, but continue to have a couple of questions. I plan to sail a lot in the Great Lakes, and on the Canadian side, at least, this requires a "built-in" toilet. Some small boats solve this by bolting in a port-a-pottie, but I've been seeking in vain for information on toilet solutions in the Paradox.
