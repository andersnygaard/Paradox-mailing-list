Unfortunately, this CRAP is legal thanks to our glorious congress. They passed a law that allows people to use your information without your consent unless you tell them you don't want it used: the so-called "opt-out" mode. It used to be more "opt-in", but our cash and carry congress got bought as usual. They don't even have to tell you that you HAVE an opt-out option!

My position is that while there is no presumption of absolute privacy (thanks courts!), there is a legal precedent for ownership of identity - just ask any celebrity! On that basis, use of my identity without my prior consent is a tort under US civil law. (Note: i'm not a lawyer, this is just my opinion!)

Thanks for pointing this out!
