Subject: Re: What would you change on 2nd build?

I remembered 2 more things.

I have made a rear hatch as well. Some builders that have done that have converted it back as per plans, as the cabin felt too week, but it works for me.

And I made the hatch and hatch carlins higher in the aft end and lower in the forward end, for about 1cm or 2/5 of an inch, so that there is a gap between carlin and hatch seal when the hatch is open, it touches the seal about 10cm or 4 in before closed, and the seal is compressed a bit, when closed.
