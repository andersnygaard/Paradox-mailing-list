Hi Gene.

No, the PeelPly is not reusable.

It seems that the cured surface residue of the epoxy sticks to the PeelPly.
Due to the very fine weave of the PeelPly stops the resin soaking through.
One of the advantages of using this cloth is that after removing it, sanding does not produce clogging of the grit paper due to the removing of the blush residue.
Mind you, using MAS epoxy more or less eliminates this.
