Hi Derek,

I don't seem to quite follow you here. Seems to me 25 mm nails would 
go right through wouldn't they? Obviously I am missing something - 
besides the brain cells I mean:-)

I am pretty certain that the joint will be plenty strong with just 
the epoxy and certainly once the outer glass skin is added. So if you 
use other fasteners and/or glass inside - it will be really strong. I 
just can't recall off-hand the details if Peter Lenihan used nails or 
not. I believe he actually prefers using screws as clamping devices, 
since you can "fine tune" the amount of pressure applied between the 
two layers. And then removed the screws afterwards.

Ideally one should maybe do a test joint and see how strong it really 
is. I have a lot of faith in epoxy and feel it is stronger than the 
plywood anyway, so long as there are no starved areas in the joint.
