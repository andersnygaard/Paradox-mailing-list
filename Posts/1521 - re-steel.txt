I saw this in a post about 2 hp motors,.....Well , if you are going to do that, why not make the chine runners adjustable, too. I'm not sure it would be wise or practical, but irt sure would be fun to try and figure out how to do it.

Thinking more about the steel hull bottom, now I know this isnt for the "everyday" backyard boatbuilder, but if you have access to a welder and some basic tools you could make this steel hull bottom and weld to it anything you really need. Now im not trying to reinvent the wheel here, just make it a bit better if at all possible. In the quote adjustable runners.... you could make bolt on runners, or segments that could be added in or taken off, and these sections could be lead filled steel tubes or angle iron sections that would like plug into the next, or slide on a track. As i read somewhere Matt had said the runners were prone to picking up debris in the water, so they would have to be shaped..

As I have been reading thru the post here I have learned that ballast is not needed in the ends so steel floor would not have to extend to the ends of the boat, perhaps the cabin area only. Also, I was thinking about using the same steel in the floor to support the mast and brackets to open that bulkhead a bit more for the larger person to get around in there or make more of the formal cockpit larger, and perhaps extending the cabin top forward if this can be made strong enough, aside from reasons why it isnt any bigger than it is, just things im thinking about here.
