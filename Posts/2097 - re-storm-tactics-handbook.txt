Nels, 

At 1400# in 14 ft, a Paradox is hardly a lightweight Sharpie. I rather think 
it is a balance issue. My sailing canoe will exhibit the same behavior if one 
doesn't pay attention to it.

You point about the rudder is quite valid, I think. It's not exactly a foil 
designed for high angles of attack. I imagine it would be pretty easy to stall.
