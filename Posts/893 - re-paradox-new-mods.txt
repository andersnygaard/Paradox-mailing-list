He hasn't changed the sheeting arrangement Al, the one in the picture was the prototype, the one on the plans is a two to one purchase. Yes the mainsheet does catch on things, mainly the rudder head and the yoloh mount and also the cleats. Matt's fix was very simple and works well so he told me. Good luck on your launching tomorrow, we are all waiting to hear how it goes.
