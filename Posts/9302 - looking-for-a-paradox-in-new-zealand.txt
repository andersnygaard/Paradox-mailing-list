Subject: Looking for a Paradox in New Zealand

Does anybody know the contact details of the current owner of "Petite Lady" in Auckland, originally built by Hugh Millar? I know someone in Auckland who builds replica NZ scows and he is very keen to look over a Paradox. It's a bit far for him to come south to Christchurch to see mine. Is it still you Peter Bennett?

Cheers,
Rob.
