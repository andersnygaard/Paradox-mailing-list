I agree wholeheartly, the one thing going for you is that it is a lamination of 2 and you still have the other one backing the convoulted and irregular grain patteren, also a knot or epoxy filled will not transfer the forces evenly, the spars are part of the sails shape as they do bend, you would get a straight area with more tension than anywhere else where the knot or repair would be. I think the peice of mind is worth the cost and effort to replace it. It would make a great place to store your backup set of sails.

Based on personal experience, knots do indeed cause weakness in wood spars, but surprisingly it is not the knot itself, but rather the fact that the normal 'straight grain' of the wood swerves around the knot and has 'grain runout' in the vicinity of the knot.

In my opinion, wood grain runout can be viewed similar to a scarf joint.  If the runout of the grain is more than 8:1 or so, the wood piece could be improved by cutting out the section and replacing it with a 8:1 scarf.

In short, filling the knot with epoxy would do nothing to fix the grain runout.

In an emergency, I might be tempted to wrap the spar with fiberglass and epoxy on the section with excessive grain runout near the knot.  [Just my opinion.]
