Respecting everybodys reasons for having or not having a motor, I do
have a heavy 80's johnson 6 hp mounted on a folding mount, offset, I
mount the plastic gas can between the two rear cleats, I also strap a
bungee cord over the cover to the cleat and the sheet does not foul,
unless too much slack, and then the rudder is usually the culprit. If i
had more time, more money, etc etc I would go out without the motor, or
get a smaller motor, but this setup does not strip the boat of her
sailing abilty or stabilty... adjust ballast....

I wouldnt count out the paradox if the only thing holding you back is
the outboard decision.
