Subject: Oppositional Defiant Disorder and 2 HP Motors

Hi DC,

If you do a Google search on the above subject, you will discover that by responding, you are only feeding the behavior.

By the way, what is your opinion on a 2 HP Yamaha 4-stroke motor on a Paradox? Do you think it is too heavy of a motor? Anyone else have an opinion?

Cheers,
Nels
