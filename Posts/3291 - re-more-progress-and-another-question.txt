6 hp Johnson on JillBaby, 60 lbs, just move the ballast and cruise at will at low rpm, motor sails very well, I plan on going to a 3 hp when in budget. I also added a 1000 watt 2 stroke generator to the boat charge the batts and keep that juice going!! I sail in Rhode Island USA near Newport very strong currents and tides, changing winds, rocky coasts and lots of traffic. and with my granfather of 103 years old living with my mother if a problem arises i must be home ASAP.
