Subject: Re: Cabin Fans

Best fan I ever saw was a 220v AC unit for some computer equipment or appliance. It looked like a giant computer fan (9 or 10 inches square possibly). I ran it at 110v (here in the states, ya know). I could barely hear it, but it produced a very nice breeze. The bigger fan, the slower you can run it and still produce good airflow. The slower you run it, the less noise it will make.

Modern CPU fans are terrible, IMO, because they're built to pump 50 cubic feet per minute through a 2x2 inch hole. My computer sounds like a jet taking off.

Also, automotive radiator fans are built to be fairly quiet for their output. The blades are staggered so that they don't set up a consistant hummmm.

Good luck! I too am very sensitive to noise.
