Subject: Re: Progress on building 'Faith', my Paradox Sailboat

On my old cutter, the pin for the yulah was lignum vitai (spelling??) and the socket was another piece set into the stalk of the yulah.
For Paradox the bolt with the head rounded seems about right. The socket I'd inset a block of real hardwood into the the yulah, fitted in such a way that it can be replaced relatively easily when it gets worn....the idea of graphite-epoxi seems interresting.
A small universal joint attached to the yulah with a pin to inset into an oarlock socket may work well.
