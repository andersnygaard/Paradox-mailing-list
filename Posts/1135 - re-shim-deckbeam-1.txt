I had the same problem with frame 1 and was relieved to see the shim on the NZ Paradox.  I have shimmed about 5 mm at centreline.  To get a straight carlin between frames 2 and 4 I had shaved down  frame 3 a few mm too.  I made longditudinal intermediate deck beams instead of athwartships.
 
I now have sides, bottom and deck framing / vent trunk done plus rudder blade and stock and internal panels - I'll post a progress report and updated photos (Aussie Paradox) in the next few weeks.  
 
I laminated the chine runners to sides before attaching bottom.
