Here are the details of the two leeboards and rudder.

Built all of these with solid black ash, which I already had in the shop. Covered working edges with 6 oz fibreglass and epoxy. Have run into rocks at full speed- bombproof.

Used standard procedure to weigh the leeboards and rudder so they sink instantly, which involved screwing brass screws around the perimeter of the hole and filling with melted lead (used car tire weights purchased for $10 from a scrapyard). Melted lead outside with a camp stove and poured it (after levelling) into holes using heavy leather mitts and protecting myself with face mask and apron.

I used standard kitchen cutting boards cut into 8-9 inch diameter circles to fully support the swivelling points. Again, I wanted all this bombproof. I sure appreciated this last time I was going down the river and got the leeboards jammed between rocks in a rapid. No damage.

Here are the dimensions:

Holes for lead- 5 inches in diameter

Leeboards- 34 inches from pivot to tip. 44 inches overall. 9 1/2 inches at widest point. Inch thick stock at start.

Rudder- 28 inches from pivot to tip. 32 inches overall. 8 inches wide. Inch thick stock at start.

All three pieces have cross sections shaped like an airfoil.

Why 2 leeboards? I was guessing, but guessed right. On short tacks or in light winds, I only use one, either one. But on long tacks, especially while reaching, it is better to lower the one on the lee side. And when close hauled, especially in stronger winds, both leeboards down make the boat point higher. I also think the weight on each side adds to boat stability in heavier weather, and besides, it makes the boat looks nicer in my opinion.
