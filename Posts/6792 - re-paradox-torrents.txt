I would now and again want to do a race, just because I raced a lot when I was younger and enjoyed all the boats going out on a course in unison.

I have also been looking at the Souriceau 4.75m from a french designer, but feel that the plan cost is far to much for a boat that size

THanks for alls comments and answers to my questions.
