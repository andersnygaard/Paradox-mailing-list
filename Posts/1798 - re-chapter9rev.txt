I spoke to Sven about the issue of having his latest book translated into English. He said he could do it, but absolutely doesn't have the time. I then asked him if he would be interested in co-authoring a "photo" book. Again, he's too busy. The only way we're going to see any of Sven's books in English is if someone like Kjell, or another person who will translate for free, decides to do it. I had a Swedish friend paraphrase Sven's book BRIS about six years ago, and it took a huge amount of time. We all owe Kjell a debt of thanks for doing what he's already done. That took more work than many of us realize.
