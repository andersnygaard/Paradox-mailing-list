Hello,

I'd like to know that I have set up a new Yahoo! Group, `smallsailboats' and I invite you to join.

The address for joining is http://groups.yahoo.com/group/smallsailboats 

Subject matter will be, as you have gathered, any discussion  regarding small sailing craft.

I am hoping it will be a profitable gathering place for those with like interests, whether they sail, own, build, cruise or just have an academic interest in small sailing craft, traditional or modern.  A broad spectrum will be considered, from messing about, to top class racing.

Please join in and be part of the fun.

Bill.
