I don't want to be picky, or to get in the way of the discussion; but this word "vang". . . .

A 'vang' is the line connecting the peak of a gaff or sprit to one or other of the quarters: it controls the twist of a gaff sail or of a sprit-sail, and helps control the sail during a gybe.

The line which pulls down the boom and flattens a Bermudan sail is a 'kicking strap'.
The line which pulls down the luff of a sail is a 'tack-line'.
The line which pulls down the boom of a balanced lug can be either a kicking strap or (more usually) a tack-line. It is neither a vang nor a down-haul.

Sorry to interrupt: back to the discussion of tacking. (Or, more correctly, changing tack. Sorry)

Best wishes,

John
