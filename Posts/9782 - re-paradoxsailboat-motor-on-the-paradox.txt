Thanks for the information, Nick!

Good to have some information, it looks so much more advanced than the trolling motors. I want to use it in choppy conditions as well, but I never thought of fixing it the way it was meant to. I will have a second thought about it; and if there is any suitable alternative.

Regards,
Eerik

Swapped it out for a Honda 2.3
The torqueedo is fine in calm waters , no good at sea , it=E2=80=99s not robust
enough , a few rough hours of hull banging and you=E2=80=99ll find damage to the up
lock . If you mishandle the battery the case will break . They are a
fantastic motor for calm water though .
Fishing line in the propellor can cause the motor pod to leak then you
need expensive repair .
So if your a calm water sailor , go for the torqueedo

I have also cut off the head of the trolling motor, and installed the
speed controller inside. I went for the motor when I experienced
difficulties with getting in and out the marina with stronger winds. The
motor doesn't have enough power in choppy waters, so my plan is to upgrade
to Torqeedo Ultralight, 3hp equivalent.

Cheers,
Eerik

My paradox had a trolling motor that I had cut the control head off to
mount inside. The trolling motor worked great.  It did not have much range,
but it did have enough to take care of my minimal power needs.  I have a
2.5 HP outboard, and when looking to fit it on the Dox, I just could not
get past the weight and the sheeting issues.   Others may have had better
luck but a trolling motor cut in half is vary small, unobtrusive, and does
not foil sheets.

Hello Paradoxians,

There are those who enjoy having a motor on the paradox for many reasons,
while others hate the entanglement the motor causes with the sheet.

I have attached two pictures I found on the Internet of a paradox where
one can see the potential issues with the motor as the sheet dances with it.

What comments, solutions, and thoughts could you share regarding the
mounting of a motor on the stern of the dox and the logistics of the
managing the sheet?

The pictures below display the potential problems with the sheet lines.
I remember seeing a dox with a trolling motor mounted onto the side.

Do most paradox sailers use the motor? I have been sailing for three
years without a motor and limited to lakes whereby I there are no currents
or tides.
