Subject: Re: MastDrawing

Thanks I believe that I have been able to decipher the profile.
From what I gather the left side of the profile would be the front 
of the mast and where it shows at the "section at deck" the right 
side would be the rear side of the mast, which is the straight 
portion.  And yes if you take away those arrows left of the 
centerline then all that of the right of the centerline indicates 
the dimensions of both the starboard and port side of the mast.
I would imagine that you build the rear section of the mast first 
and join one of the sides to it that would give you the taper of the 
mast. Then join the front of the mast and put the plugs in the top 
and bottom and the copper ground strap as well before closing with 
the final side portion.  The rear section of the mast doesn't 
indicate the thickness dimensions as it goes up the mast.  Would 
that be the same dimensions as the front section? 
 
The "Section at Masthead" detail shows to install a halyard sheave 
but if you install a masthead light at the top of the mast where do 
you install the sheave relative from the top of the mast?

Thanks for the help with this.
