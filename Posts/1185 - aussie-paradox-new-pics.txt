Hi Guys,

I have posted a couple of photos showing sheathed hull &amp; deck, commencement of cabin framing and my arrangement for storing an anchor on the foredeck - sorry about the shadows.

I'm guilty again of deviating from the plans with the cabin construction. Yes, the cabin front and back are flat - done because it seemed to be a logical to extend the front at the same angle as the vent trunk web (see my previous post and framing photo)and there was plenty of bonding surface at the forward face of frame 4. I think the cabin still looks attractive. I am currently puzzling over how to make a "tropical" cabin top but may revert to something like in the plans.

I am getting rid of my ISP in a week so if I don't post or reply for a while it will because I don't have internet access.

Andrew
