Well I really thought somebody had or was in the process of building a paradox at 110% of the plan size? There seem to be quite a few people interested in building oversized enigmas, possibly my memory meshed that info together.

On the flip side. I'm going the other direction, and building at 90%. Had I made that decision earlier, I would have used 1/2" plywood for the bottom instead of 3/4" - no harm, no foul; just extra ballast in the perfect spot. Some give 100%, others 110%, and slackers myself only 90%.

Respectfully,
Bobby
