I seem to have more time than money lately so I will be taking my time before buying materials. I also want this item to last for a long time and will problly be storing it outside after it is built. Does anyone know if the boat Little Cruiser was built with fiberglass. It looks like it had no fiberglass when the paint was stripped.
