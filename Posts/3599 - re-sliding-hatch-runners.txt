Subject: Re: Sliding hatch runners

Hi,

A good point. I am not sure what would have to happen for such 
serious damage to occur, and I don't want to be there to find out. 
Remember, however, that the Paradox is designed to float even when 
full of water.

My own worries along this line were more to do with some joker 
jamming the hatch while I was asleep, dried out on a beach. The hatch 
runner is held down by 7 bolts each side which are easily accessible 
from inside. Removing the nuts from one side would allow the hatch to 
lift off.

Alternatively an adrenalin-backed boot in the right place would 
probably snap off the quarter inch wooden lip on the runner.

A more serious worry, IMHO, is that of getting trapped by fire as the 
cooker is just behind the hatch. For this reason I have both an 
extinguisher and a fire blanket.

Hoping for calm nights
