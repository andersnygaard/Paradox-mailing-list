Subject: Brick Heater

Greetings,

I was wondering if anyone has experience or ideas regarding a heater for my cabin which does not produce smoke or require a chimney. I imagine using a material such as soapstone or a red brick that slowly emanates heat. My plan is to build a small wooden box with holes on the top and bottom along with a hinged lid and finger lock/keeper. Following cooking, I will heat the soapstone block/brick with the cookstove and then place it into the wooden heater. The heat is then gradually released. Its wooden box will protect me from any burns and also prevent any potential fire hazards if the boat were to be rocked heavily by motorboats or strong winds. I am hoping to keep any condensation off the windows and make a winter or rainy day in the boat more comfortable and cheerful.

Looking forward to any advice or recommendations you may have.

Cheers,
Steve
