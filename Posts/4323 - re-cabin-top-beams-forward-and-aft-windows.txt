Subject: Re: Cabin top beams, forward and aft windows


Bill,

The situation could well arise when the hatch is closed and someone 
may stand or sit on the front section of the cabin roof and I'm 
wondering if the structure would be sufficiently strong not to buckle 
or cave in if the middle beam were left out.

According to the plan, the very top edge of the forward window is 
shown as absolutely straight, and yet the window in its plane is 
curved elsewhere, more so towards the lower part.  As I said before, 
it would make more sense to have a small curvature at the top of the 
window where it is attached to the front beam.  However, the 
flexibility of the window material may cope with the situation.

Hoping for calm nights,

Al,      
Yeovil, England.
