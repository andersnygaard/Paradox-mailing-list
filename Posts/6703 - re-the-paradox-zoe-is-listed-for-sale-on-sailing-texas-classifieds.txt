I live in the SF east bay. Yes I'd love to sail in tandem sometime. First I have to take a few lessons this spring. I'm so raw don't even know what the three sail lines are that I see in the cabin (I am sure one is to raise the sail). LOL...

I can't imagine a lug sail is that complicated - at least I hope not. My last experience was aboard a volksboat and the capt. spent most of the time tuning, changing, and futzing while I sat there and drank beer. 

However, I always loved the Paradox drawings and the concept of an encolsed cabin in a micro boat. So we will see...

Congratulations Mark! Zoe set the gold standard. You have a beautiful Paradox.

I'm curious. Where are you located? You mentioned plans to sail in the San Francisco Bay. As a Paradox owner living in the Sacramento area I'd be interested in getting together with you if you'd like to sail in tandem over the summer. Since moving to this area I have only sailed in Folsom Lake.

Regards,

Mark W.
