Subject: New to the site and looking for plans

Hi everyone!

My name is Chuck and I've been waking up every morning at 1:00 am and reading about the Paradox until 5:00 and have decided it looks just too fun to miss out on "the build". I've looked at some great builds...amazing the detail that everyone has put into creating this cruiser!

Nels suggested that I post my request for a set of plans, suggesting that someone has them for sale. If you do, please contact me either by email at bofagear@yahoodotcom or phone...3zero3868zero118

Thanks!

Chuck
