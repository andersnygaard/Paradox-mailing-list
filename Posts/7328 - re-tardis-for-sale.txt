Thank you for the reply, Geoff.

I am certain the experience of building would mean I enjoy using the vessel even more. Actually with a vessel such as the Paradox I almost think buying one complete would be 'cheating'. I am just impatient I guess. :-)

The cost... $12k wouldn't be that big an issue for me once it was spread across the two or three years it would take me to complete the build. I guess if it came all at once it would seem too much.
