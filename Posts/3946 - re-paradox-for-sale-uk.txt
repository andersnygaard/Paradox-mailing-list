Hi Derek.

To tell you the truth, if the scaffolding next door had come down early summer(its still up) I was going to build a 17' PARADOX type motor cruiser for my 2HP Honda OB. I had already cut out the hull parts and bulkheads last year. Same accommodation as PARADOX but with a multi chine shape. But I had to build something. The rests history.
I still intend to build it after PARANIGMA.

If I were you I would talk about your new boat on the forum after all, a lot of the members seem to motor more than they sail.
I will back you up.

Jeff
