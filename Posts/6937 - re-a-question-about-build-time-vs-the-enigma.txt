Subject: Re: A question about build time vs the Enigma.

I wonder if a clever builder couldn't do that him/herself?  At least you could avoid the difficulty of bending the chine logs, etc.  Off the top of my head, I can't think what the difficulty would be.  As far as strength goes, s&g done properly should be stronger.
