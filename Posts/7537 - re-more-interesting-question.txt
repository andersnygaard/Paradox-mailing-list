I'll take a bigger repair on the trailer vs a smaller repair + filling with saltwater anyday. 

On plywood boats I usually carry a little piece of plywood, epoxy coated with a few holes pre drilled in the corners. A dozen torx drive screws and a tube of 5200 fast cure. Not the best repair but it will slow a leak way down until you get out of the water. 

At least you got your trip in BEFORE the event.
