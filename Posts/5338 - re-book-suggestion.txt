If you want a chance to take a look at the contents of Self-Steering 
Under Sail online here is the link to a pdf copy.

I found this book to be good on theory and helps you understand the 
various commercial systems available. As for building your own it 
doesn't offer any step by step instructions but would be good from 
a 'reverse engineering' perspective.

I agree that the idea of a national Paradox meet would be appealing - 
unless you're already in Hawaii Rod!
