Subject: Internal mast wiring

I'm sure this must be an old question, but as I'm about to add the final side panel to my mast I thought I'd better ask about what others have done about internal cables and, more importantly their entry and exit.

I'm going to run a length of RG58 coax for a VHF antenna together with wiring for lights (may put 4 core in just to have a couple of spares!. Obviously these exit the mast at the top somewhere below the solid top section, and in a location which will not foul the halyard or the yard.

At the bottom I can't see any easy way to route the wiring below deck level that won't seriously be a lot of hassle when inserting and removing the mast. I'm inclined to bring the cables out above deck and just bring them inside via the vent trunk. I can't say I've noticed what others have done. I'm also concerned about water ingress through either top or bottom entries. I suppose I'll just have to apply some flexible sealant.

What do you think?
