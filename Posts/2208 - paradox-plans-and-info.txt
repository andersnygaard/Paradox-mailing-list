Subject: Paradox Plans and Info

Greetings All,

New Member here. After searching the Internet for the "Perfect" Boat I think I found it in the "Paradox". I have been gathering up all the Information I can find on this Boat. I ordered the Paradox Building Booklet from Don Elliot the other day and am looking forward to recieving it. I will be ordering the plans in the next few weeks.

The only Boat Building experience I have at this point is the Bolger Brick I completed in May of this year. I taught myself how to Sail in this boat and now, I am ready for something more advanced. I even Rigged it like the Paradox so I can get use to the controls.

Thank You,

Dave Blow
