I started the FAQ file using Nels list of questions as a departure point. I would ask that any one who has the time and desire please feel free to click the edit button and start filling in the answers to the questions and adding new ones you would like to have answers to. What I have been doing is answering them by searching past posts for good replies and using the copy and paste function. Also it helps to have two screens open, one for the editing and one for the searching. With a little help it shouldn't take to long to have a really nice file. Don't worry about the long lines of text in the file after saving the edit session, when done I'll paste it into a word processor for cleaning up.
