Mark,
He can average about 4 kts or more down wind.
Based on my observations at the start on the first leg Saturday.
I have seen some 2.4's in the river which is impressive.

There was a famous(in Australia anyway)chap called Cliff Young who,aged
61,won the 500+ mile Sydney to Melbourne running race.He was a farmer and
famous for running in overalls and gumboots.He was victorious against
professional athletes decades his junior.His secret was minimal sleep.
Cheers Neil
