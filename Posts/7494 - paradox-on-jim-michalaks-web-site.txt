There is an interesting letter on Jim Michalak's web site <http://jimsboats.com/> about a Paradox owner who wasn't happy with the performance, fitted a lee board and reckons it is a great improvement.

Not much detail. From the picture it can be seen that he has made some design changes during construction, whether any of them are significant to the sailing performance is not clear.
