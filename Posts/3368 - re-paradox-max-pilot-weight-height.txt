I met Stephen and saw his boat at the Port Townsend Wooden Boat Festival a few years ago.

Stephen is maybe 5' 6" and has a medium build. His boat was shallow draft and had rounded chines with only a token keel if any at all. The boat was unpainted Fiberglass and looked pretty rough but, I don't think he wanted to look like a rich American. When he says that he traveled simply there wasn't room for much else.

I'm 6'1 and weigh 250 lbs - I would fit in his boat but I'd feel like I was in a coffin.
I wonder if this isn't a chance to encourage the construction of a "Big Paradox"? 20% larger would make a world of difference.
