Bill,
Great photos; thanks for sharing them. 
Question: where did you get the plans/drawings for building your Yuloh?  Are they shown on the Paradox plans?  I purchased the plans for the Paradox, but I don't see the Yuloh there. Do I need to put on my glasses and study them some more? <grin>
Thanks,
Dave Raftery
