I hope you can try again Geoff. Of particular interest to me is how much time at a stretch you spent solo inside Paradox's tiny cabin. I'm sure that Paradox is quite capable of crossing oceans. The problem is the mental health of the person inside that cabin.

In the trips I've done so far, I've never been more than a few hours at a time sailing (not a Paradox. A Michalak Philsboat which doesn't sail itself like a Paradox would), but even over that short time boredom has been quite a problem for me. It's hard for me to comprehend what it must be like sailing non-stop day and night without the ability to get up and walk around.

Cheers,

Rob.

PS: My build has now started. I've roughed out the mast, yard, boom and yuloh and built a masthead light using a waterproof LED strip around a circular plywood form.
