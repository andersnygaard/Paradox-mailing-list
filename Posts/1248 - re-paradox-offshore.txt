I am posing to an earlier thread because it seemed the best suited. I have just spent an evening reading and scanning all of the posts on this forum. I am very happy to have found this group.

I would really like to know the "offshore" capabilities of this design. I wonder if applying a limited use of kevlar/carbon fiber composites could improve the strength of key components, ie. mast, rudder fittings. 

I have been considering a Dix Designed Mini Transat 650 http://www.dixdesign.com/didimini.htm. It is a fast boat capable of transatlantic crossings, but it is a much more involved building project and is much more of a single purpose design--racer. Something about the Paradox just does it for me.

Any ideas or suggestions? I have ordered Don's articles and will send for the Paradox plans from Dave tomorrow.

Thanks for the bandwidth, Freddie

ps. Does anyone have a Paradox within 200 miles or so of Annapolis, MD? Or actually, does anyone have one near a city serviced by SouthWest Airlines? I would be willing to fly out for a weekend to study a Paradox.
