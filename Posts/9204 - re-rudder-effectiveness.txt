At 7 knots, I'm not surprised you were having a hard time controlling her! Phew, that's way over hull speed.


Could it be that a Paradox's chine runners at high speed result in large vortices, that pull the boat from side to side? I've noticed that yulohing takes far more energy than I would expect at 2+ knots, which I've concluded is coming from the chine runners. When running down swells, my previous boat would take off, leaving a large wake as she started to surf. My Paradox doesn't do that. Instead, she starts rolling from side to side and once you straighten up, she slows down quickly.


My thinking, is that if one chine runner is down and the other up, the deep chine runner's vortex drags the boat to that side, then detaches as the boat slews, buoyancy forces the boat upright, inertia keeps the roll going and then the other chine runner takes over, since downwind rolling and slewing tends to increase unless you actively stop it.


So, I think we're back to Andre's solution, reduce sail as much as possible going downwind, otherwise it's going to be uncomfortable, very hard work and you're going to arrive at your destination physically exhausted, yet hardly any sooner than if you'd reduced sail to begin with.


But, in your case, Nick, happy as a clam!
