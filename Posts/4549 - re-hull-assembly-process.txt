Subject: Re: Hull assembly process

A big thanks to Bill and Al. It all sounds so simple!

I'm already using nails as locators, and have been throughout, and 
i've also got temporary blocks screwed to the side panels  at each 
bulkhead station.

As you both said, make sure everything is true during the dry fit and 
it should just be a question of reassembly using the glue.

I won't be in a position to do this this weekend but maybe next weeke 
is a possibility. I still need to do some work on the cleat bevels, I 
haven't touched the transom yet, although the cleats as cut are 
almost correct. I then need to coat all the bulkheads and inside side 
panels with epoxy before I do the wet build.

There's also the small feature called the vent trunk. I've built the 
top for this but have made no further progress with the side panels 
or mast step. I believe it's probably best to get this built and 
fitted before the wet assmebly stage, so that might mean another week 
or two passing before final assembly. I've learnt that you can put a 
lot of time into this boat and see very few results! 

Thanks again.

Pete

PS I hope the weather improves soon so you both manage to get off on 
that West country cruise.
