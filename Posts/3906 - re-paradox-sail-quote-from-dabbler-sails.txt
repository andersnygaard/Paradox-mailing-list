Subject: Re: Paradox sail quote from Dabbler Sails

My MK II sail is from Dabbler and I am very pleased with it and would highly recommend him. Pictures of it can be seen at:

The ones with the ensign flying from the leech are with the MK I sail which now belongs to Bill Sargent. Notice the extra boom length on the MK II model, one of these days I will get around to Cutting it down.

For those of you interested in buying a well-made Paradox sail, I received this quote yesterday from Stuart Hopkins of Dabbler Sails: 

"I have made two or three of these challenging sails. Currently, my price would be $600.00 in 5 oz white, or $700.00 in a color (cream, tanbark). That is an exact quote. To include sailbag. Flat $25.00 shipping charge for UPS.

Currently I am mentioning quotes are valid for 30 days, because suppliers are adjusting prices more often to follow oil.

Admirable little boat -- I love the photo I have seen somewhere of one bellied out on a sand spit in the Bahamas.
