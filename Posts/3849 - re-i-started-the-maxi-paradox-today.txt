Another mod I'd like to make is to terminate the mast on the top deck and use "little cruiser" type mast braces. I'm also thinking about setting it up so the mast can fold down between posts (I'm sure there is some nautical name for these things!).

I've been wondering about one of those - a tabernacle, I think. Al's mast is lighter than mine and he can easily lift it in and out while standing on the foredeck. I'm thinking that for rivers and Broads use a folding mast might be good. I think a forestay to help haul it vertical would be all that's necessary in additional rigging. Anybody any thoughts on this? I may cut my mast up in the Winter.
