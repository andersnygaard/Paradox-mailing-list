Subject: Re: Drilling vent box Drain

Thanks to everyone who replied. 
Yes i saw your solution Steve and thought it was excellent, however 
I'd already glued the base together so it's too late for that. I 
would have used your method if I'd had a router to cut a nice groove. 
The day after I glued the blocks together a friend at work gave me a 
router he no longer wants! 

I think I'll follow Bill's advise and use my 22mm tubing and see how 
it copes. I think trying to drill out a 32mm hole would be quite 
difficult.

I'll keep you informed once the deed has been done!
I'm hoping to glue the hull together in the next week now that I have 
everything prepared and ready.
