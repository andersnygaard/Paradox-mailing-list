I have been experimenting with laminating the deck beams.  I just pulled a beam out of the mold that was glued up using PL polyurethane adhesive, and it seems to be a good part.  It kept the shape of the deck beam and is very stiff.  It is not fully cured yet, so when it is I will try stressing it a bit.
