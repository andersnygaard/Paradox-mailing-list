Subject: Re: Mock up of Hatch

If it does hit the furled boom only me and you will ever know and I can trust you not to tell, can't I?
Also, I have allowed for cutting a hole in the hatch top and securing a thick rubber glove there so I can reach up and help the furled boom into position without getting my hand wet. The rubber glove is to hand and red to match the sail. If fitted I will rename the boat as 'Bantam'.
