Subject: Paradox for sale

I was wondering if anyone bought that Paradox? Even if you had to rebuild some of it, $500 would be a good price. Mindy and I paid $1600 for Little Cruiser, and she required some refitting after 3 years of full-time cruising. Of course $1600 is what it cost Matt to build the boat along with 3 months of full time work. Incidently, Paradox cost Matt around $2000 to build and it also took 3 months. Of course Matt is an expert builder and I'm always amazed at how well everything is put together in his boats. When "Swamp Thing" came up for sale a few years ago for $600, I told my friend Dave Gatan to buy her or I would. Believe it or not, "Swamp Thing" is really the best sailing boat of all of Matt's designs (IMO). She reminds me of an Albert Strange canoe yawl with her very narrow transom, and she sails to windward like a witch and tacks like a dream. If my friend Dave every decides to sell her, she's coming with me!
