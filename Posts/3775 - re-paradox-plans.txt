Isn't the Florida challenge more a challenge for the crews rather than
the boats?"

Sure, the Gulf of Mexico is just a little salt water pond in the winter
with a 35 mph wind blowing in your face!  Never gets rough except
sometimes in a hurricane, but that is only in the dog days of summer. 
Looks like you could get all of the Great Lakes in the little pond about
20..30 times, depending how you fit them.  It is only 12,500 feet deep in
just a few places.  Just a little duck pond, for a little boat and a
little sailor and a little mind.
