DC, you have hit the nail right on the head.
The Sharpy hull form is a good load carrier but tender when lightly ballasted.
What sounds better, a PARADOX of lighter construction with extra ballast or a heavily built one with a slightly higher centre of gravity and less ballast?
I will be starting the build of my PARADOX as soon as the weather permits. Using stitch and glue construction the sides will be 3/8" and the bottom from two layers, 1/2" and 3/8. The runners will be shaped from the solid and screwed in place. The main frames will form part of an egg box construction along with the water tank longerons. All the panels have been developed out, they are slightly different from the originals, and are ready for marking on the ply. I should have started the build three years ago but family pressures put the project on hold. The epoxy is now three years old but has been stored at a constant low temperature. I have been assured this will be OK.
