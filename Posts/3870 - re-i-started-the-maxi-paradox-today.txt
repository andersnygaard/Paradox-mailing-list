As soon as I punched the send button, I knew that was wrong. If you reduce the thickness 
20%, the relationship between stave width and diameter stays the same!
To prove it to myself, I drew it up in a CAD program and the width/diameter ratio stayed 
the same.

width=3D1
thickness =3D .5
diameter =3D 2.5

and 

width =3D1
thickness =3D .4
diameter =3D 2.5


Spoke too soon,
