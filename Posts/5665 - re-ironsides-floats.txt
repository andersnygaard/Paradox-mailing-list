I suspect we have the same weather. It rains frequently here, but not in great amounts. I have sometimes, because of the weather, wondered if there was a way to propel the boat from inside the cabin. Using the legs for power since they are big. A big slow turning propeller hung from the transome,(like an outboard motor). But how to link them together? Ropes? Hydraulics(with water)? Anything which is not greasy/oily. And somthing which can be removed and put away when not wanted. It is a hobby of mine to think this way. I have not done well on this challenge so far. Noli is interesting name. How did it named this?
