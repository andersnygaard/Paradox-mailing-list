Hey Nick, thanks for detailed answer :)

Yes I agree that having to come up with something (sand, rocks) when cans get empty is harder and messier than just hitting pump button. I really like separate tank idea, this way you can keep your water potable, inspect or replace easier etc. I will consider doing it your way. 

Do you have pics of the tank? How do you clean it etc?

I'm not too worried about stringers and chine logs as I will use Norway spruce, pretty soft stuff and I will steam it in PVC pipe, should gradually take shape. If you had problems bending 18mm (fir/okoume?) plywood, it confirms my suspicions that bending birch plywood would be almost impossible. I will probably go with 12 mm bottom.

How much fiberglass did you put on bottom and how well does it wear? I was contemplating bottom stringers on the bottom of the outside of the hull to prevent bottom from damage when beaching, but I'm concerned about hydrodynamics. From what little I've read, the boat is sometimes difficult to tack as it is.
