Hi David,

You can expect that she will tack thru 110 degrees and foot well, she will tack thru 90 degrees and plod along with disappointing performance. Keep in mind that you don't need but about 10% increase in speed for every 10 degrees you fall off to make it worth while. As for the ballast, don't forget yourself and where you are at. With no one aboard she should be bow down. It helps if you have someone ashore to tell you where she is floating with you at the helm station. if she trims bow up then move weight forward. You can also use a level, just put it on the floor boards as they are level with the waterline.

As for the mast length my problem was that I could not stow the spars (mast) with the anchor light attached. I solved the problem by cutting some of the reinforcement structure on the inside of the inspection port away. I can now stow the spars inside but I find that it is easier to just put them in the truck and take them out and install them. If I were to stow the boat or trail for a great distance I would put them inside the boat so every thing would be there when I was ready for them. You will find that when they are stowed inside you will have to climb in and out a couple of times to stow or retrieve at each launch so you can save a few steps if every thing is not inside of the boat. This is probably not very clear is it? If not I will elaborate further.

I never leave the inspection port cover installed unless I anticipate a following sea slamming into the stern (Gulf Stream crossing) because I want all the ventilation I can get. If it starts to rain and you have to close the hatch You will really be thankful that the port is open.

Tailwinds, 
Glen
