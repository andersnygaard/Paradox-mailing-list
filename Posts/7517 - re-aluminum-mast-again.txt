Subject: Re: Aluminum mast - again

I might as well give the aluminum mast a try. 

My chine runners are coming along, not very pretty though. I won't try and explain the process because I'm not sure I even understand what I'm doing. Vent trunk seems small but the measurements seem right. I put some small cleats in for the tiller baffle now just cut and recut until I have a pattern to use. My rudder stock is glued together and seems to fit the spot , just needs a few hours of shaping later. 

Will be a fun boat eventually.
