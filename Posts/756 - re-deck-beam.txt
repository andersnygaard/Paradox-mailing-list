Paul I like the idea of a build plan and hope you keep on posting it. 
If I build one it will follow much the same order as you, since I 
will be simplifying it as well. No water tanks and a few other 
changes. I'm glad to hear the beams will work. May I ask what kind of 
plywood you are using? Is it 5 ply or 3?
