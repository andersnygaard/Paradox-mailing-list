Cheers Dave.

I will be taking Matt's article with me
CAWS made me a set of sails about 25(blimey) years ago for my DART 18 catamaran and they set a treat. Not a wrinkle.
I started to win the cups till it was pointed out that my sails were not one design. They were cheaper than the overpriced crap the class sold as well.
Up till then I had been using some blown out non class coloured striped sails but still finished towards the front.
While I had a suit of nearly new sails, I was asked to use the coloured set as it would make the fleet look "colourful". Yeh, right!
In the end I used the class sails, came second, sold the boat and have not raced since. Stuff em!
I prefer my own company anyway.
This afternoon I have glue on the port chine runner and filleted around the deck. Tomorrow I shall be out all day so it looks like the starboard CR will have to be fitted on Friday.
Looks like it will be fine for the weekend as well. Ain't life wonderful?
How's SWAMP THING coming along. Will she be afloat this year?
Say Hi to Mindy for me.
