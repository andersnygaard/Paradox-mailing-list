Subject: Re: 'Faith's' Progress

You never know. The unexpected can happen. There's still a good 
deal of work yet to do and I need fine, dry, warm weather to do it. I 
have to get the boat on the front lawn and tip her on her side to 
apply the Copperbot antifouling. I'm applying antifouling 
because 'Faith' may spend long periods on a mooring, and some of her 
cruises my be over a month in duration.

Managed today to finish the chine runners and glass there 
underneath. Covered the glass with PeelPly to get a smother finish 
and reduce work later.
Tomorrow I will try and start work on the hatch.
This coming week I hope to take delivery of my new trailer. Its a 
combi and rated at about 500 lbs.

Ideally, I would like a combi. I had a quote which worked out at 
=A31800.00 and I thought I would try to get by on something cheaper; 
hence I bought the trailer used by Derek Clark for his 
Paradox 'Enuf'. Apparently it worked, so I'll give it a try.


Will be ideal for using with NOLI and my dory rowing skiff. 
As soon as the trailer arrives I will plonk NOLI on and post a 
picky.
I am still hoping to be afloat with NOLI by the end of July but I 
have just had a bit of extra drawing work thrown at me. Still it's 
money.

If all works out as proposed, Al and I should be finishing our West 
Country cruise in the Falmouth area which may extend to the Scilly 
Isles. Maybe you'll be around too?

Hope all goes well for you.
Cheers,
Bill.
