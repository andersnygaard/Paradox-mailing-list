I have the same Harbor Freight trailer and attempted to get bearing buddies (or equivalent) for it. After much searching, one RV dealer figured out that the chinese company that sells it used car hubs instead of trailer hubs: nothing on the market that he could find fits them.

I found this trailer a while back and bought one for another use (hauling my riding mower). It is a decent relatively inexpensive trailer $289 for occasional use. I picked up mine at a Harbor Freight store within driving distance.
It folds and sores against my garage wall and I like it. One could add 'buddy bearings' to make them waterproof.
