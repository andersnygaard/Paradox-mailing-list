I recently discovered what is called a Mud Skipper set up. It is sometimes also called a mud motor or swamp motor. It's a kit with a long tail and prop with a guard around the prop and is powered by a horizontal shaft motor. A small horizontal shaft motors can be purchased for as little as $120 USD. I think the motor could be easily packed away with the "long tail" and prop being stored on deck next to, or in place of, the Yuloh. This may be the best set up for the Paradox if you simply wanted something for maneuvering in tight spots or shallow water.
