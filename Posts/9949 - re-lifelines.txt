I have a line each side which is permanently attached at the bow and secured near the transom. This gives me an instant bow rope for securing to a pontoon etc., a lint to attach to the anchor rope so that I can anchor from the bow without leaving the cockpit and a line to attach a harness to in the unlikely event I want to go on deck while at sea (not happened in the last 20 years). I would not consider going forward with the sail up as the boom would do it's best to throw you overboard. If I do get on to the foredeck then the mast is my main handhold.
