Subject: Re: Ballast access


If they are fitted with the top wooden retaining pieces through which there are 2 bolts entering a wooden block glued to the floor (towards the mid section) and another 2 bolt into the chine log, the pigs can be shifted fore and aft.  The difficulty comes in getting at the 2 bolts under the flap sticking out from the tank ballast top. I suggest making a removable plank instead of having a flap.

How about making access holes (1" diameter?) above the bolt heads.

Whatever way I do it, I'll need easy access to the lead ballast for adjustment and maintenance, and at some time I may need to get at the jubilee clips that secure the PVC pipes to the copper inlet/outlet pipes.  I think the best option would be to make the side pieces of the water ballast tank top into separate, removable `planks'.

Bill.
