I'll have to correct you there, Steve. The work on the website was, like with most of the things I do, minimal. I simply snitched someone else's web design and then all that was required was to type in the correct file names for the photos. After a couple of tries I finally even got that right.

Glad you found it helpful, though.

Hoping for calm nights
