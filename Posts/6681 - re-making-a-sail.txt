Subject: Re: Making a sail

I did,and now that I know more I wish I hadn't (at least not with that sailmaker).

Go to someone who understands lug sails. He should ask how much bend there is in the yard when it is under load. Mine assumed the yard 
would stay straight (or didn't think of it at all) and as a result it was too slack at luff and leach.
