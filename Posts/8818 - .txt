Subject: Camping thoughts and mods

Richard, 

I will be happy to contribute some camping thoughts following a month long trip on the Saint John's river in Florida, which involved a lot of winding channels. 

As far as mods are concerned, I believe my "half topping lift" idea works like a charm at easing furling movement while not interfering at all with the sail. Also, my boat which was built by Steve Yahn has iron ribs for the middle bulkhead, which permits a much wider inside sleeping area. Nice.
