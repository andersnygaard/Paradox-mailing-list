I have put into the photos a page from a book on Junk rig. The main sheet is doubled, one on each side. Would this work too? The Book is PRACTICAL JUNK RIG by Hasler and McCleod.

Hi,All,

Thank you for kindly reply.

Maybe we can consider to change the sail to junk sail,like "little Cruiser" type which the length of boom will shorter than "Paradox",then the main sheet will no problem to outboard.

Rod and Stephen,

I have uploaded 2 photos showing the sheet on 'Faith' was per plan, except it had a small length of piping on the starboard side to help minimize snarling of the engine.  Apologies about the poor quality of the photos, but they were cropped from larger photos.

Bill.

PS
I meant to say these are in Faith's album in the photos section.
