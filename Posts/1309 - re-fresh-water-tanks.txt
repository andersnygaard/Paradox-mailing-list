Funnily enough, only this weekend I was pondering the idea of self-flooding ballast tanks. It should be feasible, the tank is below water level. But make sure your inspection hatches are really watertight!

I carry my drinking water in 2 litre fizzy drinks bottles. I mark them on the outside in mug sized divisions so that I can always put just the right amount of water in the kettle. In an emergency, they can double as fenders.

Hoping for calm nights
