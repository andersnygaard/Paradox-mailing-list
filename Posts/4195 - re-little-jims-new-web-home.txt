Hi Al,

Thanks for the new address. It opens up OK and works a treat, except when I use the back button to leave the new address:

http://www.little.jim.freeuk.com/little_jim/little_jim.htm

I'm finding the old address of:

http://www.as4jg.freeuk.com/little_jim/little_jim.htm

works just as well, without the problem of leaving the site by the use of the back button.

Does anyone have a similar problem when it comes to leaving the new site with the back button?

It's because I used the truncated version of the address, http://www.little.jim.freeuk.com (for simplicity). Because it then pulls up a dummy index page before loading the correct page you need to take 2 steps back to get out. If you use the full address, http://www.little.jim.freeuk.com/little_jim/little_jim.htm then only one back step is needed.

Does that make sense?

Hoping for calm nights

Al,
Yeovil, England.
