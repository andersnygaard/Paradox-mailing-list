Hi All,

My request for Volenteer Moderators was answered by Dave Bolduc and Paul V. A very big thank you to them both. We will now be covered most if not all of the time so it will be possible to close the group and have new members apply. This should eliminate all the unwanted spam. Again thankyou Dave and Paul!
