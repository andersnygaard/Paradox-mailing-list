All great points Jim!

This reminded me to mention that Paradox gets some of its leeway prevention from a larger than "normal" rudder area so you have to consider that. On the other hand re-boarding steps can be built into that larger rudder.

Also one should consider that if you go with Matt's furling system you are going to have a huge roll of sail around your mast when reefed. Not sure if that is "doable" beyond a certain sail area?

And a good stable mounting location for the kicker, preferably as close to the centerline as possible is essential with a boat that large.
