Most people who now use Yulohs install a pivot on the stern for them, similar to an oarlock. This prevents chafing on the transom and tethers it if you let go. I sort of remember duckworks sells that swivel.

I fully intend to have a Yuloh on my next boat.

I want to tell of something that happened to me this last summer while on the Paradox. I was near Gig Harbor and using my yuloh as my engine wouldn't work. Something distracted me, I forget now what, but my yuloh had slipped away and was drifting away from me very slowly in the current. I was very annoyed and a little scared of losing it. I picked up the wooden seat board and used it as a paddle and caught up to the yuloh. It was clumsy going but I got it.

The seat is a paddle.
