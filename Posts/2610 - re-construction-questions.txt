Subject: Re: Construction Questions

Hi John and welcome,

I, for one, built Zoe with an opening in bulkhead 1 thou I've yet to store anything in there. I can't even imagine puncturing a hole in that area (or anywhere for that matter). I thought about an anchor well during construction but am glad I didn't bother because going to the foredeck isn't a lot of fun. I just stow my anchors in canvas ice bags in the bens aft of the seat. They are easy to deploy and retrieve from the hatch. I secure to the aft cleat and once anchored go forward and drop the line in the bow fair lead. When it is time to go I host sail, and flip the line out of the fair lead and pull it in along side, pull in the sheet and we're off.

Glen
