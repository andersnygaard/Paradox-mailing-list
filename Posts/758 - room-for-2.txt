Over the years many people have asked me whether there is room for two aboard Paradox. Well, the answer is yes, but I wouldn't say it was spacious. It's important to remember that Matt's boats were designed primarily to sail 1 person full-time; though he did make accomodations to fit an extra crew member aboard with short cruises in mind. Incidently, when we cruised in company with Matt in the Bahamas, we often cooked aboard Little Cruiser and then all three of us ate aboard Paradox. Therefore, it is possible to fit a few close friends aboard for short stints, but the space available is similar to that of being in a tent. Anyway, I thought I would post some pictures of Paradox with two aboard.

Picture is of Mindy and Matt.
