Thanks Derek - Just got back on line after a couple of months of 
computer problems and trying to fix the unfixable. Ended up buying a 
new one and now observe that they are even cheaper again!

Tilikum was actually a decked over Haida Indian canoe made from a 
hollow cedar log and was quite narrow. But his other boat was only 
19 feet which at that time was considered suicidal to go to sea in.

There is an appendix at the end of the book that has a lot of 
useful information on how he managed to survive storms while riding 
them out to a sea anchor. Of course they carried bags of oil in 
those days as well which they would use to create an oil slick and 
then be protected from breaking seas that way! 

I found the appendix worthwhile even though it may be of more 
historical knowledge than useable nowadays although launching and 
riding to a sea anchor still applies IMO. "Trailing warps" was 
another strategy. The plan was to stay quartering to the seas and 
ride out the storms rather than try to fight through them.

I think Lin and Larry Pardey books are worth reading and Annie 
Hill's book on Voyaging On A Small Income - I think it is called. 

Although some of these books are about boats that are larger than 
what we loosely define as a "microcruiser" they are still 
interesting reading for anyone interested in how others have "done 
it":-)

Charles Stock's ability to find little "Hidey holes" to snug down 
in, and wait out a storm certainly demonstrates how a small boat can 
be safer than a larger one when coastal cruising.

A large factor in a boats ability is in how the captain plans his 
moves!

I would love to get the information that Sven has on using a yuloh 
clarified for me in English. (Vrikare or "flick oar":-)  Any 
volunteers out there?

Cheers, Nels
