Good Morning Glen,

I can see your point of view. But I must caution builders to follow the instructions given by Matt on the plans, they are quite specific in this area.

On sheet one Matt points outs  that the bronze ring nails are there as a permanent back-up to the glue joint (Sheet 1, at the bottom of the notes), this means the nails are there for the working (Movement) of the boat in a heavy seaway or simply hard crashes. ( Building boats with epoxy and bronze ring nails is common practice and has been for a long time).
Here is the direct quote from the plans (Sheet 1.)

"Space the nails 40-70 mm according to the ply thickness. Fastenings are intended as a permanent backup to the glue bonds, to limit splitting and delaminating or age".

The epoxy will not be squeeze out as the nails are space far enough apart (although heavy clamping with screws or tools will), also you should mix the correct amount of Silica thickener (Cab-O-Sil), This resists squeeze out (compression).
It is important when building any boat to follow the plans instructions to the letter.
Anyone that plans to build a Paradox should read the notes and instructions on those plans and follow them completely.
If you want to change something or not follow a instruction or do something a different way, then it will serve you best if you clear it with Matt first before proceeding. I never asked him a thing as I figured if he said it in the first place...he meant it.
