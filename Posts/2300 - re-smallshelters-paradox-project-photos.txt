Hi Dave,

George Buehler likes to use 2 by ? with a covering of 3/8" ply:

This would work well on the bottom of something like a 20' 
or larger sharpie IMO.

The amount of extra glue might cost as much as just using all ply. 

If you are going to trailer sail, I would just paint 
instead of glass.  Use 3 coats, different colors to tell 
depth of any damage.  Paint every year or 2.

Best of luck

Mat
