Subject: Re: Materials - Plywood

BS 1088 looks like a British Standard quality code. Any ideas as to what a comparable quality would be in the States? The quality of the glue seems just as important as the quality of the veneer, but it seems like the American system focuses mainly on the surface.

I'm definitely going to do a lot of shopping around, and take my time.

Thanks for the advice. I am working as a volunteer with a school that offers me a unique opportunity to get some materials donated as well. I'm trying to put together an order of build that will allow me to do many of the smaller assemblies long before I have to start scarfing, gluing and glassing the hull assembly. We'll see how it goes!
