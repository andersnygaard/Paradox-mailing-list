Hello Bobby,

Thanks for those comments. I'm looking forward to hearing about your boil tests.

I wonder, if the pressure is an issue, if you could use some temporary bolts and then fill the bolt holes after the joint has set.

Six days seems a long time to harden, but having said that my paradox was build primarily on weekends, so in my case there would have been a good time between glue jobs anyway.

My reference to epoxy and fibreglass is because I noticed after some breakages (less said the better), and also when I needed to remove a piece of glass from Small Fry's bottom, that once a sheet is started it just seems to peel away more easily than I thought... but as far as I know you're right, epoxy is the strongest resin for glassing and I think it is just my expectations that are out of whack, not anything wrong with epoxy.

Please keep the posts coming, very interesting so far.

Cheers,
Geoff (Australia)
