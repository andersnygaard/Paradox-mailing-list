Subject: Re: Scale mockup of wind genny and radar on Paradox

I have a 12V wet NiCad battery (I was given it in 1977 when it was replaced under routine maintenance from the coal industry). I charge it up in the spring and it powers my gps, echo sounder, lights and water ballast/bilge pump all season without further attention. What will you have on board that will need so much more power?

I suppose if you have the radar it makes more sense.
