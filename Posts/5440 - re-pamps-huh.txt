There is a little ditty that goes with the words PORT and STARBOARD. It goes; "IS THERE ANY RED PORT WINE LEFT?" So this way it helps you remember that the red running light goes to the left side of the hull, called PORT and the green running light goes on the right side called STARBOARD. When your tired and maybe seasick and maybe a little scared, all these little things are a help, at least it has been for me. Good Luck, Steve Yahn
