Any bright ideas on how to fit these?

I'm thinking a hefty backing block under the deck and just epoxy in place?

Also the fwd Yuloh loop, I'm thinking of just using a plastic pipe clamp.

That's what I use. I snapped the first one off when I got a rope round it, without realizing it, and tried to pull it free, But the replacement has lasted for 5 years.

Hoping for calm nights
