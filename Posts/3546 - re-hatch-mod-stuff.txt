Subject: Re: Hatch mod stuff

Hi

No, I've not decided yet.
I still like the copterpack idea and will make a card mock up soon, but I need to try it with 
the mast and boom up to check clearances. I am familiar with the Griffiths hatch and may 
try a mock up of your idea as well. In fact, a combination of the two ideas may give good 
headroom and a secure fitting.
Unfortunately, I've aggravated my wrist problem by sanding so everything is resting.
Compulsory rest and culture day today - off to see the woodcuts of Franz Gertsch.
