Hi,

Your problem is that you are not keeping enough tension on the ropes. 
I have just changed from the Mk1 sail and the Mk2 seems to need even 
more tension.

One solution may be to fit a 2:1 purchase on the halyard, as already 
mentioned.

Another solution is to fit a topping lift. This supports the boom and 
prevents it dropping onto the cabin top. My topping lift consists of 
a loop of line running from the reefing axle to the top of the 
mainsheet tang. A hauling line is attached somewhere in the middle of 
this loop (lots of trial and error to find the right place) and taken 
through an eye at the masthead.

As has also been mentioned the position of the sail on the boom is 
important (more trial and error) and, for the Mk2 sail, the fixing on 
the yard needs to be further aft or the boom will be too low when the 
sail is hoist and may interfere with your head. 

I got my Mk2 sail in November and after 7 outings and 25 nights 
afloat I have just about got it sorted.
