Hello To All...

We spent most of our day yesterday working on the top-side sheer clamp and between myself and Mr. Johnston we have not a single pic of what we accomplished! (it is RARE indeed that my uncle go anywhere without his camera!) But with yet another day spent on ENDEAVOUR progress was made. The sheer clamps turned out to be easier than thought and once they were in, well let's just say she's hell for stout.

That's one thing that has really impressed me with this vessel...she may be many things but weak isn't one of them! Our plans are to roll her some time this week and start on her bottom, and if we stay the course we've laid out...we're going to do all of her bottm work while she's rolled. That's all the epoxying, taping, fiberglassing, fairing, and ultimately painting. Thus when she's rolled back "upright" her exterior hull we be finished from the sheer clamp down.

I can see many hours of sanding in my future...till next time...

Safe Passages To All,
Greg
