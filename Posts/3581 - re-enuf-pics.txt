Local waters seem to inspire local boats. In the days of sailing working craft there were always huge regional differences in the designs because of the different conditions weren't there? Was it solely because of different conditions? The only local type I know anything about is the Yorkshire coble with its flat bottom aft for pulling up sloping beaches transom first. As a kid, I remember seeing fishing boats pulled up the pebble beach in Kent or Sussex (Hastings?) and they came up bow first. Perhaps sometimes alternative solutions have been found in different areas for the same 'problem'? Maybe styles stayed local because ideas didn't travel far in the days before printing, radio, TV, etc. Perhaps a 'standard' sailing working boat might have developed eventually but for the adoption of the engine.

They always used to say that the English Channel bred very short steep seas and the old British prewar yacht was narrow and deep - like a plank on edge- to deal with these seas. Don't other parts of the world have very short steep seas? Now I think about it, I wonder if sailing boat styles in US, Oz and NZ are a good place to look. Their boat development presumably didn't start until colonisation. The early settlers boats would have been either what they took with them, or built with knowledge and skills taken from here. Then the addition of other continental European building traditions, and after a relatively short while along came the internal combustion engine.

The point that I am laboriously trying to make is that I think that sea conditions in a single place are bound to be replicated elsewhere, and if they are it doesn't require the same hull form to deal with them. Therefore a boat built for sailing along the East coast of the US ought to do well elsewhere:0)
