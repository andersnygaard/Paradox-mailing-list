I have started (slowly) to do some of the jobs that have been building up throughout the year. Last weekend I reinforced the front edge of the rudder. I had noticed that it was getting worn down so that the weave of the glass was showing.

The method I used seems to have been quite successful. I took a couple of feet of 15mm copper water pipe and cut it in two down its length with a band saw. After annealing one half it was surprisingly easy to form it around the front and bottom of the rudder. I put in a couple of holes, countersunk on the outside to make an epoxy rivet, and glued it on. A little bit of fairing and it looks ok.

On my last trip out this year I had met up with Derek Clark. He asked whether the pipe I had used between the furling spindle and the deck (15mm copper water pipe again) was strong enough. I had had no trouble with it, and pointed out that most of the time it was in tension so the fact that the split end was a bit flimsy didn't really matter.

The next day I sailed back to my launch site - a F5 following wind for 0.5hr at 4 - 5kn & a broad reach for 1hr at 3 - 4kn, sail 50% reefed. When I got the boat on the trailer and was stripping down the rig I found that the split end was badly twisted. I think it must have happened just after I started off when I made an unexpected gybe. I was too busy tidying up and not paying proper attention, but then a gybe in a Paradox isn't a drama, and there is no chance of a boom/head interface. If it was then that it happened then it made no difference to the subsequent operations.

I have hammered the bends out of it and as I still had some split tubing from the rudder I made some doublers and soldered them on the outside. The result feels much stiffer, time will tell if it is strong enough.

Hoping for calm nights
