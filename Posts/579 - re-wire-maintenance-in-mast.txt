I noticed that one of the freqently replaced item on
sailboat is electrical wiring due to corrosion.
If the lighting wiring and the Mast-head light wiring
are epoxy to the interior of the mast. Does it
mean one have to cut the Mast open each time to
replace these wirings?? (Or is there a Paradox design
feature which allow one to do this that I overlook? )
