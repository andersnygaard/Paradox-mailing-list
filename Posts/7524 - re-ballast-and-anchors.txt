Subject: Re: Ballast and anchors

I have had good luck with Bruce anchors as well, big jump in the sizes though 2kg or 5 kg. I will probably go with the 5 but has anybody used the 2 kg with success? Also have a couple danforth types laying around to pick from. Still need one more so I will keep researching. I have plenty of chain to load up and use instead of all lead. At least chain will be useful. 

Thanks for the info on ballast numbers, it's starting to make a bit more sense. 

Spent some time shaping the yard today. Anybody break one of these yet? It's the first part of the boat that doesn't look way overbuilt.
