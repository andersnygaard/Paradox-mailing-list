Yep. If you can cut and shape it without dulling all your blades, that is. You have very stable wood in your hands. I wouldn't hesitate to use it.

Hi All,

I am slowly but surely fininshing my second Paradox and starting the 
construction of the mast. I have some Heart Pine 2x4 and 2x6 that I 
tore out of a remodling job on my house that was built in the 1920's. 
This stuff is hard as a rock. I thought about using it for the mast 
and spars, but am not sure how well the epoxy will work with the 
seasoned wood. Driving a nail in this wood is almost impossible. Any 
thoughts?
