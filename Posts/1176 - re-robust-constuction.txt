Very well put Kjell, having fun is the most important consideration.
In practice the rudder comes up very easy, much more-so then I had expected and there is less things that can go wrong. My experience with bungee cord is that it doesn't last long in the environment and a down haul would be needed to keep the blade down if your bungee went walkabout. Also to keep that buoyant blade down a pretty strong bungee would be needed and make the up haul heavier then lifting the ballasted blade, which as mentioned before is very easy. If it the lead casting that you object to I made a Little Cruiser rudder to try out and instead of melting lead I got some lead shot and mixed it into epoxy and poured it into the rudder cutout which had the screws just like the hot lead version. It worked very well and was much easier to fair.
