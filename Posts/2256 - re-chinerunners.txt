A note of interest Kjell, When epoxying aluminum, which begins to corrode the second it is sanded, the trick is to coat the surface first and then sand through the wet epoxy thereby eliminating any chance of oxidizing the metal. In such a project as yours I would consider doing the same to the bronze. Another thing that I did when installing the ground strip on Zoe was to drill holes along the edge and counter sink the outside face. This lets the hardened epoxy in the hole act like a rivet. The idea was to stop the plate from experiencing peeling forces which is where the epoxy is weakest in this type of application. Good luck with your project! how about some more photos?
