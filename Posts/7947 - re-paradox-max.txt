I want to question the scaling of stability.

You said it scales to the square, but I thought it scaled to the fourth power.

Bigger boat are usually more stable that smaller boats.

Conceptually thinking of a multihull, the mass scales the the third power,
and add another power for the righting arm.

thanks

Malcolm
