Subject: Re: Tiller Rope Lock

I agree, it is rarely necessary during normal sailing. The occasion that Derek mentioned with me standing up I was just relying on the friction of the system and had not locked the tiller (though, of course, I had locked the sheet).

If sailing in shallow water, however, with the rudder partly raised, the tiller line must be held, or locked, as quite large tiller loads can be seen.
