Hi Glen.

Actually, I haven't even gotten the clamps installed yet. I don't think that it's a matter of having the blkd elevated enough, as the deck beam height at the sheer is correct. The intermediates will be installed normally, as you describe. I'm not fundamentally opposed to a shim here or there, though I am dismayed at the necessity to do so. Wish I could refer to full size lines. Oh well. Everything will work out fine in the end.
