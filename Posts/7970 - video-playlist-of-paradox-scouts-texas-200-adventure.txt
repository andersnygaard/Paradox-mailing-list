Date: 27 Jul 2014 20:12:05 -0700

This does not hold a candle to what Dave did in Hawaii....which is TOTALLY AWESOME!!! ....but i put all Scout's Texas 200 vidoes into one playlist...the first one is just a short quick teaser followed by more detailed daily video logs (1 for each of the 5 days)...then there are some clips that were given to me and taken from other boats showing Scout from their perspective. ...   Enjoy....
