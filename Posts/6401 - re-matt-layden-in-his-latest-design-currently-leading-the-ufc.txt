Subject: Re: Matt Layden In His Latest Design Currently Leading the UFC

I am paying close attention to the race myself. This has been fantastic. As of right now, 11PM Eastern Thurs Night it seems like Matt is ahead of the Manitou and Whitecaps on the river!

Does anyone have any info on that river, as in flow direction and so forth?

I was pondering whether the *slightly* ballasted displacement approach would allow a boat like Elusion to actually capitalize on favorable currents (though I imagine it would be a major detraction against current). 

Just pondering. I have been amazed as he has simply blown me away with the performance of this little boat of his. Perhaps its just his experience as a sailor (and ability to sail with so little sleep?).
