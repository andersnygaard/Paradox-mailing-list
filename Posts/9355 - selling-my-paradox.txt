Subject: Selling my Paradox

Hi to all, especially today all in Australia. 

I am thinking of selling my Paradox for a larger boat. My partner wants to come along too, so we now want a bigger boat. 

It has served me well, just back from another four day trip along the Gulf here in perfect weather. 

I built the boat over 8 months with a little help from a shipwright. I have built two boats prior to this one and had some experience. The more difficult jobs were completed at Duck Flat Wooden Boats, a professional and respected builder here in South Australia. It was made from the finest woods available: First Grade Marine Ply, Oregon, Hoop pine and Kapur. Completely fibreglassed outside and some of the interior is glass clothes as well. 

It's made to plan, except for the mast. I paid 1250 dollars for a round hollow, "birds mouth mast" of first quality hoop pine, it's light and as strong as can be made. I wanted to see the process and I wanted it light and extra strong, it's also a bit of a work of art to look at. 

It comes on a registered trailer, with a 2.3 Honda motor, professionally made sail, the mk2 version in good condition, a 70 litre underfloor PVC water tank, and has some signs of wear but in near-perfect condition, ready to go. The cost minus labor was over 8000 Australian dollars. 

All the bugs are ironed out. It sails just as it should and is a lot of fun and for me very adventurous. 

Wondering what interest I would get here before I advertise it on boat selling web pages. 

Hope someone is out sailing one right now.
