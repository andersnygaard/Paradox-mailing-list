Great going Bill, watch out for the snow on Sunday.

How do people finish their fibreglass sheathing? With my previous boats I've used plastic padding to good effect. It's so easy to sand, enabling a good finish.

I used epoxy with micro-balloons (also easy to sand) where I could be bothered.

Hoping for calm nights
