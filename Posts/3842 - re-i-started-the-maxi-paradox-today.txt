Subject: Re: I started the maxi paradox today

Hello Nels. I'm currently planning to use the lug sail. I don't know much about sails but I have read much about the lug, at least the traditional version. I need to figure out how wide and long my mast will need to be. I also need to figure out how much sail area I'll need. I'm looking for hints, formulas on how to do that very thing. I'm guessing I have some time to figure that out. That won't be something I have to deal with until the top deck starts to go on.
