I am very sorry to hear you are not well.  I had end-stage renal disease 8 years ago, 8 years of dialysis later I have a brand new kidney.  Cancer can be beaten, too!

I am very interested in the Paradox.  I am in the process of starting to build one now.  If you seriously think you must give up your Paradox, I am very interested.  How can we get in touch?
