Honest, I did check the boom clearance and left 4cm.
However, no matter what angle I viewed it from it was ugly. It was much too tall to be beautiful and even though I'd settle for plain, it wasn't even that.
The wife came up with the idea of a second seat position halfway between the floor and normal position and I was able to reduce the height of the hatch considerably. 
There is a new picture of it in Photos:MoreEnuf. The lower seat still allows an arm out through the rear window/washboard, and gives a bit of a bend to the knees. I didn't have these knees when I started building. I had a much better set. :0)
Also, a picture of my slide arrangement: two pieces of brass strip from B&amp;Q.
The hatch now slides forward on top of the coaming. To hold it down there will be a shaped wooden block hooked over the hardwood strip that you can see in the picture 'slides'. That will be removable from inside: that was a good point raised by someone (Kellan?) earlier.
Security will be taken care of by a big guy from Birmingham who says he'll do it for the drug concession, but on the days he ain't available I'll use cord, camcleats, bolts, wingnuts and a lock (stainless steel; also B&amp;Q)

The hand is much improved thanks. Some post op swelling causing pain in the thumb but the Doc says that'll clear in a couple of weeks. The feeling has come back in all the fingers which is great. I'm down to have the other one done but I'll make sure that the appointment is post Summer.

If I finish the hatch next week after my heavy working stint of Mon &amp; Tues, whoops, Tues only - it's a Bank Holiday - the only big job left is the finishing.

cheers all  ....  Derek
