Hi Johan,

All the movies on paradox are available on youtube as far as I know... just search for "paradox sailboat". If you don't add the sailboat part you will get alot of junk. Good luck.... I think if you build this boat you will be happy with it. But before you decide also check out Fafnir designed by John Welsford. It has alot of the positive traits of the paradox but was also designed for blue water voyages. It carries more weight and is wider by almost 2 feet. I also hear it is alot easier to build.

Have fun,
Rod
