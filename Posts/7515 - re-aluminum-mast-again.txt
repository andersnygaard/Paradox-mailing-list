Subject: Re: Aluminum mast - again


No idea about this, but the wooden mast is very stiff.


I ended up assembling my chine runners from 1"x1" wooden bricks about a foot long (and lots of epoxy). Bending and holding continuous strips defeated me. It works ok though.

I left the stbd side of the vent trunk off till quite late in the build to make things like inserting the baffle easier. The tiller baffle is difficult to shape correctly. I recommend cardboard templates (lots of them!).

What is the problem with the rudder? I don't recall any particular problem there.
