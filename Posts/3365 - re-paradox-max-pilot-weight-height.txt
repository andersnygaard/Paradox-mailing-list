Subject: Re: Paradox max pilot weight ,height


He may not be comfortable, but I am convinced that the boat would sail perfectly well with him in it (after all Matt sailed 2 up on several occasions). 

I have just read "The Stormy voyage of Father's Day" by Hugo Vihlen. 105 days in a boat 5ft 4in long. What are these people thinking of when they say that Paradox isn't big enough. :->

I think that it was me.

I've no doubt it will support him (he weighs half as much as you again) but he is exactly the same dimensions as my brother and he is big. I really don't believe that there is room for him to move around comfortably in a Paradox with the lid shut.
Not just a question of the weight but his height as well.

Feel free to ignore me but I have a Paradox and I have imagined my brother in it, and it wouldn't work. In fact my brother saw Enuf before I put the cabin on and he likened it to one of his shoes. His smart arse remark was, "I'd need two of those. Do they come in a left and right?"
