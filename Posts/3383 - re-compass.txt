This would pass the hours while lost and prove usefull.

I use a garmin gpsmap76 I also carry a smaller etrex vista, both work 
with my compaq m700 laptop for a moving map display and both have a map 
display if not connected to the laptop. I also have a moderate quality 
kayakers compass mounted incase of the unexpected.
