Thank you Ron. I'm lucky to live here it is so nice. I think I remember seeing a little trimaran some years ago. Funny huh. Boat building gets under your skin I think. I saved up all kinds of materials while I was working just so I could use them during my retirement. Coping with a retirement income is a new skill. Good luck. Steve Yahn
