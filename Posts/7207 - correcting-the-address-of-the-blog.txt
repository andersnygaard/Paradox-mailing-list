Subject: correcting the address of the blog

I live in Florian=F3polis, Brazil, and has built other boats, sailing from a young age. The first boat I built was entirely Sztrandek, design polish (did Sztrandek the first in the world). Then build two catamarans Tiki 26, James Wharram design, boat excelente.No however convinced myself better be a small boat and know the project Paradox was fascinated by the qualities and possibilities of this boat. I decided to build a sail in my region, beautiful place that allows large sailed. 
The catamaran is wonderful but I have requires that sits at anchor in a homeless and this causes me concern and hard work, while spend much of my time building boats. I tried for many years, a boat that offers the maximum in the smaller size, and Paradox is that boat.
I appreciate the prompt response.
