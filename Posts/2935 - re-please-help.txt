Hey even that sounds good to me! This is URGENT!!! I'm in need :)
I'll glady pay anyone at this point for a set(full) of plans, and construction man., and what ever else would be helpful.
If anyone is interested let me know! I'll try to make it worth while, plus agree to pay the amount owed to Dave and Mindy.

Oh, welcome aboard.
