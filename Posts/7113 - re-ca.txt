Subject: Re: CA?

That's it! Thanks Jeff.

You were right, I did not take the rudder into account. And yes, the centroid moved forward approximately 50 mm with the hull heeled about 25 degrees.

So this seems to be what Matt did. His CA seems to mean the Center of Area, including the rudder, when the hull is heeled 25 degrees or thereabouts.

Thanks,
David
