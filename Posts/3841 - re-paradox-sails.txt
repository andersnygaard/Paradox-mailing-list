One way to counter the tendency for the sail to move forward as it is furled is to   taper the boom so that the clew end is larger diameter than the tack end.

I'm not sure how to compute that exactly, though. The good news is that with a rig as small as Paradox, it could be a trial-and error affair. Start with maybe a 3/8" difference and then have the spokeshave and plane at the ready.
