Thanks for the clarification. I'm not sure why you consider the sail moving forward to not be a problem. Is there a trick you use to furl the sail? I keep thinking of that watertribe video of Matt's roller blind demo making it look so easy. Wouldn't that be a problem if the sail started wrapping around the reel? or are you talking about a subtler movement?

I might point out that my 3/8" diameter taper guess comes out to 29.92 mm difference in circumfrence. Pretty good guess, I think :-)
