Did that very thing.  I used pressure treated 2x6 fir made into a tee.

On one I used just epoxy with some thickener.  On the other I used 
three and one half inch wood screws.

Then I used a 3 lb hammer an proceeded to "dis-assemble both of them".

The epoxy joint never did break.  The wood did.

By banging away on the other piece I was able to get the screws to 
pull through.

This was only after 2 days drying time on the epoxy.  I have no idea 
what the bond would be like a few months or years later.

The one thing that concerns me a little is that when ever I have cut 
through pressure treated wood the wood never seems completely dry 
inside. Does the copper solution they treat the wood with every dry? 
Or is it just that the stuff I have cut is new from pressure 
treatment?

Come to think of it, maybe the moisture is the reason pressure 
treated weighs more is the moisture.

Anybody have seasoned pressure treated around that they can check or 
experience they can share?


Later,

Pete
