I hear the term yuloh used frequently as if it is a part of the microcruising concept.  Do the Paradox plans come with plans for building a yuloh?  Where did you guys get the plans if not?

Subject: [paradoxbuilders] Pipe Stowage rail

Hi All,
Does anybody have any thoughts on how to install the P&amp;S pipe 
stowage rails. My plan was to mount a backing plate under the deck and 
drill a 1/2 inch hole, fit the rail and fill with epoxy. Any thoughts 
or comments?
