Subject: Re: Considering Dingos and Modifying Paradox

I respect your admiration for the Paradox as designed, but please reconsider what makes a Paradox a Paradox.  I have a 1969 C-Type West Wight Potter that I converted from a Gunter Rig to a Hasler/McLeod Junk Rig.  It didn't cease to be a West Wight Potter in so doing.  I had another one that I converted to a Lateen Rig.  It too, was still a Potter.  

You're mistaken here.  They're not Potters anymore.  

As an example, if you offered them for sale and didn't mention the rig conversions, anyone showing up to buy a Potter would be confused and upset with the change.  I also doubt International Marine would be willing to claim them as Potters.

It's fine for people to experiment with boats.  It's fun to do and educational.  But in most cases I'd bet what they learn is that it's cheaper and easier to buy or build the boat they actually needed than to make serious modifications to a boat they had for other reasons.
