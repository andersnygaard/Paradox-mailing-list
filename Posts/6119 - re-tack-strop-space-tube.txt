Just searched old post and got alot on this spacer tube for the tack strop but I am a little confused.  My plans show the tube is not forked.. it is tied to the boom hook with a knot.  I see construction pics from other builds and they show the tube with a fork.  Am I missing something in the plans?  Or is this a modification?  Why was it done this way and not according to plans?  On reading the back post I found most related to the forked tube.  Are there instructions on making this piece anywhere? (forked)

Thanks for your help,
Rod

In the plans, at the top of sheet 9, there is a side and end view of the strut assembly. The left hand, end view, shows the spindle (12mm brass rod) bending down and splitting. Joined to it by a 6mm ss bolt and peened nut is shown the split top of the the strut tube. The tack strop is fed through the tube and the knot nestles in the Y and stops the strop pulling back through.

When you make it, be aware that this assembly needs to be fairly sturdy as it sees significant compressive and bending loads when sailing reefed.

Hoping for calm nights
