Gee Glen, this post alone has convinced me to buy plans for Paradox. I always considered it as a day sailer only, no reason why, the size I guess. 

My two cents worth is that it is a subjective matter, I consider Paradox to be a blue water vessel and I personally would not have a problem soling her great distances, however I also have 36 years of sailing experience and well over 30,000 miles of blue water experience in sail boats of less then 50 feet, most in boats around 30 feet. I feel safer in "Zoe" then I have in a number of bigger boats just because I'm sitting in her and not on her.
