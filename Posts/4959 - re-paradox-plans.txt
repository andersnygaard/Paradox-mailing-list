Heeeee!

Thanks Al, I might take you up on that offer . . . .  . .  someday!

I have been scanning all the files and forums on Paradox and I've also bought Don Elliotts book which makes interesting reading. I'm hoping all you guys that have gone before me will have tripped over most problems but sods law states . .. .  ..

Hello Al

Thanks, I live in Bridlington, its about 18 miles south of Scarborough on the east coast.

Greg

Ahh, not much point in me offering you the opportunity to pop in and see me and Little Jim if you have any problems then.

Still, the offer's there if you ever get as far as Somerset.

Hoping for calm nights

Al, 
Yeovil, England.
