At the moment I am planning to be at the DCA rally in Poole on the weekend of 24th Sept and at the rally in Plymouth on the weekend of 1st October. After that I think my Brownie points will need a bit of a top up.

Hi Alastair and Pete

Yep, I'm up for a national Paradox rally. Sometime at the end of September or early October would be grand. I hope that my new trailer will be up and running by then. Where? Poole? the Dart, or the Plymouth area?
