Subject: Re: Gorfnik #2 build started

Hi Brian,

So happy to hear you are jumping in and building a Gorfnik! You will have a lot of fun with it, I promise.

Perhaps it would be better if you put photos of your build in a separate Gorfnik#2 album, I'm finding that the first album is already getting crowded, and I'll be adding quite a few more photos!

Thanks for your interest in my design, I'm touched to see someone else building it. I'll try to accelerate posting the rest of the information you may need ASAP.

Best regards,
André-François
