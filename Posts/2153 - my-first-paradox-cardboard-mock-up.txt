Subject: My First Paradox (Cardboard Mock Up)

Sitting here yesterday nursing an earache I built my first Paradox at one tenth scale. It is a bit floppy but it serves to give an indication of dimensions. Although I've seen and photographed Al's Little Jim, making this model has helped refresh my memory for the internal arrangements. I'm hoping it will help with the real build.

I've now got my plans, my Don Elliot build book, my model, my fastenings (any UK builder try Robbins Timber of Bristol; they are half the price of Classic Marine), my lead, a building fund and enough good quality exterior ply to make the bulkheads. I've also bought a Land Rover for towing (I've always wanted an old Landy) and I am amassing fittings via eBay. Lastly, I've arranged to work 3 days a week from September so I shouldn't be lacking spare time.

Next in line is to stop fiddling with Acus (formerly Caleb), finish my Selway Fisher coble and reskin my daughter's kayak. Sanding the living room floor, rewiring the house and redoing the bathroom will move to the back burner; although they were concessions extracted from me to warrant part time working! Hopefully, I'll be building by Xmas.

Confession time: I have Olympic status in lethargy and apathy. If you'd like to gee me along feel free; I'm going to need it:0)

Cheers ........... Derek

ps Loading a photo to Albums using Safari on my iMac doesn't work but it did let me create the album. I had to use MS Explorer to load the photo. Anybody else noticed this?
