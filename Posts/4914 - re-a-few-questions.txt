Hi Pete.

The floor mats at Maplin's won't be there long as they don't know if any more will be coming in when the present stock runs out. 
OK maybe I should just get them. They'll be useful for something even if I decide not to use them for Johanna.

I bought the camping mats for NOLI from Screwfix at under =A33 each. They also sell a foil backed version as well for about the same price, so I bought a few for under the deck with the foil showing.
I've never seen those at screwfix and can find nothing on their website. Are you sure it was screwfix?

My local cheap store sell a 3 LED press light for a =A31which should work well on your boat.

Yes I've seen those. I have a 5 LED 3AAA model from B&amp;Q which is very effective ( I also get the staff discount). I'm thinking along the lines of using these rather than putting in a lot of internal electrical wiring. My daughter uses one in her bedroom as a night light and she often leaves it on all night. It's still going strong on the original batteries, and she's had it for months.

Maplins also sell an AA battery solar charger for =A36.99 which I bought. It will charge other sizes as well.
It took 6 hours to charge from flat 4 2600 ml amps AA's.
7dayshop.com do some good cheap rechargeable batteries. 4X2500ml amps for about =A33.50, and some useful camping gear.
Yes, I'm a regular customer of 7 day shops NiMh batteries. Terrific value. I'll have a look at the Maplin charger.

I am at present looking for a good solar garden light that I could stick on to of my mast. Fit and forget.
Anyone any thoughts?
Back to Maplin? 4 in stainless steel for =A39.99?

Buy a set, keep one, and sell the other 3 on Ebay for =A34.99 each!
