Thanks again. I'll just have to wait and see how it goes. Some of my trips are going to be all over the Western US. This is partly why I chose a small affordable trailer boat. My nearest boatlaunch is 1/2 mile away in Manchester. Maybe for short trips just lashing the Mast to the sail group will be good enough. I bought my plywood for the boat today so, now to begin work.
