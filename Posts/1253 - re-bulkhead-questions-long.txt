Al,

Thanks for responding.

To further clarify, maybe I looked at the plans wrong. Where this is a curvature indicated say 5mm, the straight line is just a reference line and not the straight outside edge of the cleat? In other words the cleat runs right to the edge of the plywood and is curved as well? Plus it is beveled? Seems difficult to curve the whole edge of ply and cleat and bevel it.

Thanks for your help,
Paul
