Thank you both, Al and Bill. This is an very important insight. The heeling will clearly make this idea unworkable. The transome mounting makes good sense. But tell me Bill can you reach the throttle from inside the cabin? And for refilling the tank? I mean do you need to go out onto the deck to manage the engine?
Best regards, Steve Yahn

To help clarify matters I have added, to the photos section, a couple of pictures of Bill refuelling in the middle of the Atlantic. This should demonstrate the refuelling process. (note the lack of safety harness and the fact that the engine is still running and in gear!)

Hoping for calm nights
