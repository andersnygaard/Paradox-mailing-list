Ahh, I see the problem. I don't see a solution though. Could you hammer it round the curve?

That is my plan A, and also what my mechanical consultant is working on. But now I hesitate, after what John just said. He seems an experienced man.

Grind it away then bond on a curved strip?
Sounds impossible

How about laminating a thickness along the edge with strips from the offcuts at bow and stern? Glue, rivet, braize or weld them on till there is sufficient thickness to grind the curve.

That is, was, my plan B, glueing being the only alternative. Welding not possible due to the divinycell.

Failing this I think you are going to find out the hard way if the curve has any hydrodynamic effect.

My plan C, seemingly the most probable.
