Subject: Peelply

Can anyone tell me what "peelply" is and whether or not its available in the U.S.?

Photos will be uploaded to my Paradox web site at the end of the month. I normally update the site monthly. When cruising I try to put my daily log on the BlogLog portion of the Smallsailboats web site.

Your old sail will shortly be put to the test. I'll see how it sets at last.

I meant to ask if your self-steering gear would fit on a boat using
the original sailplan. If I have it right, you have the version #2 with the shorter boom.

Bill.
