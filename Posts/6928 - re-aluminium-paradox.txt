Subject: Re: aluminium paradox

If aluminium,or aluminum for our US friends,worked for Serge Testa who sailed his aluminum 12 footer Acrohc Australis around the world,than why wouldn't an aluminum Paradox be possible?
I have no clue what the gain would be but that's up to the builder to justify that choice.
Wood/plywood is a material we "all" can work with,more or less, but welding/forming aluminum requires some skills,knowledge and special tools but I assume that he who asks this question is fully aware of that.
Testa's boat being a "curvy" one,aluminum was probably a better choice over plywood.With the large flat area's of a Paradox I guess some "thinkering" must be done to get the "natural" stiffness of plywood sheets with aluminum.
"Anything" is possible if the desire is great enough.
