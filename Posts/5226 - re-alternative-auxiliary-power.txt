Thanks Al, that's some good info. I may have to look into a building a yuloh. 
For those using a yuloh from Matt's plans would you change anything, or have any of you found some interesting links on them, maybe alternate plans for a yuloh that may work better, or not? 

I have moved the pivot hole about 150mm nearer the handle as I didn't feel I was doing enough work with the lower gearing. There is no reason why there shouldn't be several hole for different conditions.

Having seen the problem Bill had I would suggest that you don't make the hole too deep. Start with it about the radius of the ball deep and see how it goes, you can always make it deeper later.

Everything I have tried with the socket has eventually worn and needed repair work. I have now settled on a system where I drill an oversized hole and fill it with epoxy/fibres, then drill the socket to fit the ball. When it needs repair work (1 to 2 seasons in my case) just clean out the hole, fill with epoxy/fibre and re-drill.

I lubricate the socket by dripping molten candle wax into it (beeswax would probably be better). This stops the squeaking and doesn't pick up grit.

The biggest problem, in the early stages, is the yuloh jumping off the ball. This can be prevented with inventive use of a bit of bungee. When, after half an hour, you decide you will never get the hang of it, stop for a rest and then carry on trying for a couple more hours. Suddenly you will wonder why you thought it difficult at all. With a Paradox it is essential that you have the rudder up as you steer by moving the stern of the boat sideways (Took me an hour and a lot of lost paint to work that one out.)
