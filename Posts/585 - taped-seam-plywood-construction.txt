Hello everyone,

I bought Paradox plans this winter and my friends and
I are planning on having a go at it this fall.

We are total newbies when it comes to boat building
and I must confess that I would welcome anything that
will promise me ease of use...

(My guess is that you get that a lot from newbies...
But I do hope my post wont be to much of a drag to
you fine people...)

And so as I look on the web for such promises I have come
upon this :
http://www.applegateboatworks.com/tape.html

I would really appreciate your views on this boat building technique.
