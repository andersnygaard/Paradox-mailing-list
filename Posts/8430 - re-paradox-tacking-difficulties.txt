Subject: Re: Paradox tacking difficulties

I think every boat is the result of the compromises that it's designer makes, and Paradox is no exception. 

I believe that Matt's original intent for this microcruiser was to make a very simple yet seaworthy watercraft that excels in it's ability to stay on course to aid the single handed sailor cover long distances. To this end I believe he has succeed completely. 

However, some owners have noted that the boat is a little slow to tack at times; however, personally I don't think this is necessarily a flaw but that it is simply part of the boat's handling characteristics. By maintaining speed and putting the helm over more delicately during tacks, the boat seems to get the job done. 

Now with that said, I will say that both Swamp Thing and Enigma seem to tack more swiftly than the bigger boat even though they too have chine runners. At the moment, the main differences I can see between the two smaller boats and Paradox is that they are lighter weight, have narrower transoms and have proportionally smaller rudders. Whether these factors aid in tacking I do not know since I am not a designer. 

As for Little Cruiser she was an experiment to see if there was any sailing performance to be gained using a bow board like Sven Yrvind had on his smallest Bris. Matt's conclusion and my own are about the same I believe. With this style of boat and the single lug rig, windward performance in deep water between a boat with chine runners and one with a centerboard is about equal. In extremely shallow water the chine runner wins out. 

As for eliminating rolling entirely I think it would be necessary to go to a cat ketch rig which would allow you to run wing and wing. However, the addition of another spar adds complication and top weight and takes away from the simplicity of the original design.
