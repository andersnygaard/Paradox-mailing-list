Hi Glen,

I just want you to know that I appreciate the time and effort you put into this sharing of knowledge based on real experience. That is what makes forums such as this so valuable as a learning tool. Particularly when there is no commercial agenda behind the sharing of this knowledge!

Same vote of appreciation goes to Al and Bill.

I have seen it advertised by a couple of epoxy companies that the 1:1 ratio epoxies are more forgiving of small inaccuracies in measurement than the higher ratio mixes, such as 5:1. Makes common sense to me that this would be the case - less chance for error - I was wondering what your opinion on this is?

Thanks, Nels
