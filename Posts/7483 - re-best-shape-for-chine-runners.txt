Subject: Re: Best shape for Chine Runners?

Thanks JIB,
It seems Matt has tried various forms to prevent leeway, and returned to chine runners at least twice according to the history of his boats I've read. So he's probably the worlds most experienced designer/user of chine runners. There being a rather small sampling of boats using them also makes his experience more valuable. ...Nathan
