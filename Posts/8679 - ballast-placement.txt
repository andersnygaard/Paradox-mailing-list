Hello everyone,

In the next few days I'm going to smelt 400lbs of lead into ingots. The plans appear to say that most of the lead (all of it?) should be located immediately aft of bulkhead 3. From scanning the archives, some people appear to have placed it forward of bulkhead 3 too. I'm building to plan with no outboard motor, using water ballast and I've got a 40lb deep cycle battery just forward of bulkhead 2. I think I will store a heavy anchor and chain forward of bulkhead 2 to starboard to balance the battery and my regular anchor will probably be in a bucket to port behind bulkhead 4.

For those of you who don't have a heavy outboard hanging off the back of your boat where have you ended up with your ballast being located?

Cheers,
Rob.
