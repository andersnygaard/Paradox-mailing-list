Interesting posts.  Up here, we have kinder gentler, well ok, all but abscent coasties, so we can pretty much do what we want.  With the increasing availability of sensible arrangements as mentioned, the need to do something stupid sorta declines.  However, there are some pretty cool garde "moonlights" that integrate led, battery and, solar panel for about 10 bucks.  They even look like a masthead light.  I'm guessing they may not be bright enough.                            

Down here in Florida I a used Kerosene anchor light almost every night for several years and only on two (i think)occassions did the CG say anything. Their comment was that is was illegal because it was not white but yellow sort of. Also blocked partially by the mast. BUT never a ticket or even a warning. They did comment that they were glad we had some sort of anchor light. In one instance we could see probably 200 boats and about 10 had anchor lights.
