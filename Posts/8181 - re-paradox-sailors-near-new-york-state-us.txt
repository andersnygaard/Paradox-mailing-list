Hi Rob,

Thank you for your thoughts. May I inquire the order of Paradox parts you made?

Example:
- Rudder
- Boom
- Mast
- Etc.

It would be helpful. I have heard that others suggested the parts first before the hull for the same reasons you mentioned. Nonetheless, I figure my boat build will be 5-7 years because I am not retired and I have too many other projects going as well. I am planning on having the boat retired when I retire as a goal and sort of a retirement gift to myself. It is a great way to stay motivated.

Let us know the order you undertook in the build of your Paradox.
