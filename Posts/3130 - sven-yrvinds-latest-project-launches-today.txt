Subject: Sven Yrvind's latest project launches today

I never had the chance to visit Sven this summer. Still living in the hope to get some time off later this fall. However, Sven sent me this picture from his launching this afternoon. On the phone he told me everything went ok with abt 150 kgs of sand and water ballast on board. The sails will be bent in a couple of days and photo documentation will follow. Since this picture is quite small, I send it as an attachment. Hope that is ok.
