Hi,

I am new to this group and my English is poor, but I am eager to learn how to build a Paradox. Can someone provide me with a build list? I also need to know what material Mats boat is made of, so that I can check if it is available in Serbia.

I am excited about building a Paradox, as it fits my needs perfectly for cruises on lakes and the Adriatic Sea. 

Thank you in advance for your help.

Best regards, 
Dalibor Petkovic
