The plans show 3 views of the mast.

1/ a half section labelled 'Section at Deck' which shows a section 
through the stbd half of the mast and is scale 1:1

2/ Behind 1 a side view section of the whole mast showing front 
and rear panel dimensions.

3/ To the right a half section viewed from aft showing one (stbd) 
side panel.

I found it confusing at first. I think it is the way the dimension lines 
cut across the two views. the view from aft finishes at the line 
labelled CL.

I hope this makes sense. If not I will try again with pictures. It is 
easier to make than to explain.

I have received my plans and will be starting my scale balsa model soon, however I can not figure out how the mast is constructed.

I understand it has four sides, but the profiles don't seem to make sense to me. The center profile drawing would seem to be the rear section since it's flat on one side so the other two should be the two sides and the front. But how does it fit together?

Thanks for you help
