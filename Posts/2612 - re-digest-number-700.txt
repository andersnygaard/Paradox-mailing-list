Hi Glen

Many thanks for your response - I have been a great admirer of Zoe - a beautifully built boat.

Your experiences with anchoring are something I had not thought about - seems to be much better than moving forward to anchor from the bow in the traditional manner. Thanks for the good advice.

Best regards
