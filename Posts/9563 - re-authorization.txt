Thank you, Matt.

I was able to upload a picture and delete an album that I had poorly made years ago. I can now better organize pictures and add new pictures for others to enjoy. Will start getting picture uploaded. On a side note, I was able to rotate a picture using the editor when selecting the picture. Very nice tool to have control.
