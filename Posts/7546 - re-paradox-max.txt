Hi,
New photos.

Hello,
Photos are under Paradox Max (Manatee).
Parts are not finished just cut out.
Bye,

Hello,
Doubling of the size, mine is too big. During this size, I would prefer a cat.
Today I cut out the side pieces, tomorrow is your turn to Bulkhead.
Already looks to boot.
Will soon post the images.
Bye,
Günther
