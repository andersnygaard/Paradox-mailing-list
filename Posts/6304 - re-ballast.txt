Hi I plan to build a paradox in the near future. So I thought I should start gathering supplies. What I need to know is how much lead am I going to need to order? The plans say 70 to 180kg that seams to me to be quit a difference between the two weights . I know it all comes down to what materials I use and so on. Is there a average amount? So I don't order more than I need.Thanks for the help.- Wayne Reynolds

I started with about 140kg, though I had the other 40. I launched and then loaded and moved ballast till it was on it's lines.

Now I am down to about 50kg of lead as I have added several anchors, a battery, tins of food, a bicycle and various other heavy "essentials".

Hoping for calm nights
