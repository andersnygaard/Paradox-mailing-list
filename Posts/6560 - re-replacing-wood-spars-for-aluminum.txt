Subject: Re: replacing wood spars for aluminum

OOps! forgot a link I had ready to include...

I'd guess about the same as used for a Sunfish would probably work-at least for a while! I think that the max stress at the partners will be the most vulnerable place...no sharp edges there.
But why not wood? It floats! and could just be left square with slightly radiussed edges to allow the paint to stay on. Square is actually the strongest- for the same weight.
Cheers,

Based on the rule of good guessing. "What looks right is just about as good as the best" I myself would select an outside diameter which is close to the original wooden item. Then I would select a wall thickness which would give a mass similar to the original item. Try to find a catalog of tubes which tell you the weight per foot of each size. I tried once to do the math for strengths of tubes. I got a good headache. Steve Yahn

I intend to use aluminum round tube to replace the wood spars on my (decreased) Paradox style sail.
Obviouis question is of course...what size regarding diameter and whall thickn.
I've done a search on this topic but not much to find.
My sail is something like 7sqm.
Any suggestions,other than using wood spars (grin-grin) are welcome.

thanks
