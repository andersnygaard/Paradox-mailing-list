Subject: Re: Larger Paradox

Im a new boat builder here so I am sticking my neck out. I agree... build it to plan or with minor changes based on your experiance with building boats. The Paradox was designed from the ground up to be a small boat. If you were to enlarge it to the extent of 28 feet or so, I would think that alot of its execellent features would be lost and this could make it uncomfortable to sail or worse. If you had that much room you would want to make changes to the interior. The Paradox is more of a complete boating system than a boat. I mean there are things in it for comfort but those same features are also there for other reasons like structure and stability. 

If you had to ask how to build a 28 foot Paradox then you are not a boat designer and are probably new at this like me. I would make a suggestion here that was made to me early on. It makes sense. There are already a couple of boats you can build out there that have the same features as the Paradox but were designed from the ground up to be bigger boats. It was suggested to me to take a look at the "Swaggie" designed by John Welsford or the Birdwatcher by Phil Bolger. Both excellent boats but .. to me.... the Swaggie is the one most like a bigger Paradox. I believe the Swaggie also has features that would make long range cruising more comfortable. Well.. I hope this helps,

Rod

Drawings are VERY clear about this: DO NOT SCALE!!

Build according to plan. If the Paradox plans is not what you want, find 
other plans that you follow precisely.
