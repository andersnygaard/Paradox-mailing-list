Subject: Re: Outboards and fuel storage onboard Paradox

I'd like to have 12 volt power aboard the little cat, but weight is a huge issue. I've thought about a motorcycle battery. I'd like to be able to run a spotlight at need, navigation lights occasionally, a small deck light, a fishfinder, a VHF radio, a CD player, and maybe a portable DVD player for entertainment at anchor.

All of these will run off internal batteries. Take a few spare and buy more if needed.

Hoping for calm nights
