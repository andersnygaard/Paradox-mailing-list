Jeff, thank you very much for clearing that up for me.

Having a lighter boat will pay dividends on several fronts, in towing and on the water, not to mention materials used to build it.

I don't know where I got the "bigger" thought from, but you've fixed that for me.

I'll definitely check out the NOLI folder again sometime today.

When do you think she will sail Jeff, or did I miss that some how too?

Thanks again ... Denny
