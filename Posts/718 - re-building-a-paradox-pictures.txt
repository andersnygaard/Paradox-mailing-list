I am expecting the sail to arrive next week, so I shall be able to play with the reefing gear before the deck goes on.

As it seems to work for Matt without a topping lift then it must be possible. My theory is that the radius where the rope comes off the drum must always be (significantly) larger than the radius of the sail on the boom. If the ratio is big enough then when the halyard and reefing line are tight the boom will want to roll upwards and therefore will support itself when reefing.

That's the theory anyway :-)

I am at a loose end at the moment (hence the time to post the pictures) as I don't want to do the painting until the vent trunk is closed up, and that is waiting on the reefing trials.

For those of you who have got this far, looking at the second 9mm ply sheet on sheet 6. Is the clearance between the aft deck and the side decks as tight as it looks?

Hoping for calm nights
