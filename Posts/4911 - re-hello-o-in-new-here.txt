Hello Al and all, thanks for your replies.

First of all excuse my turning over 'old bones' as it were. I'm new and still finding my way around and thanks for directing me to the Larger Paradox area.

As far as the offset mast is concerned, now that the reason has been pointed out to me, it makes perfect sense. I guess I have a fixed idea in my mind based of what has been presented in the likes of Classic Boat, Water Craft and The Boatman magazines as to what makes a good cruiser.

At first glance Paradox was anything but what I was lead to expect, but the more I studied things and the exploits of Matt and others - the more I like this little ship.

I still would be comfortable with a little more room, say 15ft?

I'm attracted to Paradox because of the adventures available from this boat without the need for a huge bankroll and because of the voyage logs available on the net.

As far as a motor is concerned, I think I could live without one, it just adds more complication to a simple theme, though if pressed I would install a small outboard as others seem to have done.

Greg
