Subject: Re: Small Fry rounds Cape Leeuwin

Neil,

Yes I know what you mean. We do seem to have a very round the buoys sailing culture here. But I have become aware of some quiet adventurers here too. There is a bloke in Fremantle who has built at least two large aluminium racing boats, both of which he has sailed to Albany and back. The bloke who runs the chart and map shop in Freo sailed here from the eastern states. Actually, I previously had a folkboat which I sailed to Albany a couple of times, so I had a fair idea what I'd be in for down south. I wondered if I might be able to take Small Fry further but had a sense of really having found her limits when I got to Leeuwin. Actually it was probably my limits as I'm sure Sven Yrvind would have just kept going :)

Cheers,
Geoff.
