Subject: Paradox database

I am trying to maintain a database of Paradox owners and builders at http://www.smallsailboats.co.uk/paradox/names.htm and I'm keen to update it. Perhaps you'd like to visit the page to see if details of your boat are correct?

There may be some reading this who have not as yet passed details of their boat to me. Perchance this is the case, perhaps they might like to get in touch, or post details here for my use.

I would also appreciate any new photos of Paradoxes, but not pictures of them in the building stage.  Photos (JPG format) of boats on the water or on their trailer are preferable.

Bill.
