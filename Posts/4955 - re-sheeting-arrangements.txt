I'll probably experiment with enclosing the end of the sheet attached to the transom with plastic piping to minimize snagging.  Derek Clark said this just about solved the problem with his Paradox 'Enuf'.

I can easily remove the engine and bracket if I find I don't get on with them.

I must confess I was reluctant to fit the Honda 2.3, but those who have done so seem happy with the arrangement.  Before starting my cruise I'll have to give the engine a thorough test.

Bill.
