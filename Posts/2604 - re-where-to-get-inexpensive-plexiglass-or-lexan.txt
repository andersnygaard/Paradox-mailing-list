Subject: Re: where to get inexpensive plexiglass or Lexan

I got a bunch of 1/4" scratch resistant (Marguard) Lexan from "Plasticsfolks" on Ebay a while ago. They have a 100% rating on 525 transactions now, and they shipped me the stuff promptly. Since I needed 6 pieces to do all of Little Cruiser's new windows, I had them combine my shipping. The lexan they sent me was a bit larger than what they stated which was nice, and it arrived in good condition. I'm pretty sure all the pieces they sell are offcuts. The only downside that I can see to ordering online is the additional shipping costs. Therefore, I would certainly compare prices for locally available sources versus online vendors to see which way is cheaper.
