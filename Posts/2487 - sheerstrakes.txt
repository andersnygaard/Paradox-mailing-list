The sheer strakes are in place, glued and cramped. 
I've put them in at 20mm rather than 25mm because an offcut from the sapele chine logs allowed me to get the two out at that size. The new table saw cut wonderfully and accurately.

Though it is snowing outside I got the workshop up from 7 to 12 degree with a couple of electric heaters. Hate to think what the electric bill for this boat would be.

I'd like some advice on bronze ring nails from somebody who has used them. I get a fair proportion that bend over in their last third or so of length. Often it's as though the point reaches the glue line and can't penetrate despite being in a predrilled hole. If they were screws (and I'm not saying they are or that I wish they were, before someone starts an argument :0) ) I would drill a clearance hole through the first piece of wood and a smaller hole in the second. Should I be doing that?

Merry Xmas.....Derek
