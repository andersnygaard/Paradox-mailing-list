Subject: Re: [paradoxsailboat] Electronic device for race

Long time dreamer of building or buying a Paradox here. First time posting in a long time.

My tongue-in-cheek response to all this talk of a distributed race is how about getting a good model of the Paradox made for Second Life and race in the virtual world? Sailing in Second Life is semi-realistic and a fun lark. I have a sailboat in Second Life and when I took my geographically distributed team sailing for a team builder we had a good time. Silly, educational for the non-sailors and fun.

If someone did get a Second Life model of the Paradox made I'd buy a copy. Speaking of which, I think I asked this in the past, are there any STL models of the Paradox available? I'd like to 3D print one and maybe make a sailing pond model of it.

Thanks,
Matt-=-
