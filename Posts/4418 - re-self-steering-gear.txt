Hi,

I'm sure this weight idea should work to some extent.
Fine-tuning it may take some trial and error, and 
it won't work except for beating and reaching I suspect.
It is common to add weight like this to self-steering vanes
for the same reasons.
I wonder if attaching the sheet to an aft extension on the rudder-head
might be a better method as this is effectively what sheet-to-tiller
methods are doing although usually via control-lines of some sort.
Moving the attachment point of the sheet in and out could still be 
achieved from 'inside', using a traveller, keeping all the virtues of 
the Paradox enclosed cabin.
I'm keen to try this method sometime-all I need is a boat!!
But for control on all points of sailing it seems from all the
evidence that some sort of vane is really the only method.
So, I'm also waiting Glenn!
Cheers,
Alan.

PS: Two excellent books on the subject-
'Yacht Wind-vane Steering' by Bill Belcher
'Self-steering for Sailing Craft' by John S Letcher Jr
Both of these have tested designs to make your own, and also
explain the principles and the requirements for success.
