I'm going down the water ballast path because I used soft drink bottles filled with water under the seats in my last boat and they were a real hassle,  All the filling, emptying, placement and removal was a drag.  I'm looking forward to simply placing a hose on the deck for a few minutes and I'm sorted. Granted, emptying them won't be quite so easy. I'm planning on using a plumber's siphon to empty my tanks (a plumber's siphon is one of those rubber squeezy bulbs with a one way valve in it) once the boat is on the trailer.

I tried various ideas to empty my ballast tanks and even, for one season, replaced the water with lead. I finally got a good working solution by installing submersible bilge pumps in the tanks.

The pumps are fitted to the filling pipes, water flows through the wrong way when filling, then when the power is turned on, out it comes in a fountain. This has the advantage that the tanks can be emptied (thus reducing weight) before lifting onto the trailer.

I fill the tanks with a mobile electric pump which I hang over the side. (You will have a nice big battery won't you? Think of it as lead ballast with attitude.)

Make sure you get good quality inspection hatches for the ballast tanks. Most seem to be designed to keep water out, not keep water in.
