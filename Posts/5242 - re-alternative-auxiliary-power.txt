Nothing wrong with that, of course, but if you do want to learn to sail and scull then leave the motor at home. There is nothing like being a couple of miles from home, on a falling tide and a fading wind for teaching you how to get the best from your boat. And it is *incredibly* satisfying when you do get home.

I guess not all of us are so fortunate to have ocean front property like that.
