Hi All

Thanks for that link to Yvind's project, Rob. But it's too vague to be of real use. I don't believe that the change in the center of pressure is sufficient to give the positive feedback that's required for downwind self steering. I'm talking of downwind steering while at sea so there'll be waves to contend with.

I agree that electronic self-steering is the most practical. No major modifications required but limited by the lack of electricity and the dismal lack of reliability of the tiller pilot itself.

Yes, another solar panel on the foredeck would help although that has its own shortcomings.

I'll have to settle for part-time use of the tiller pilot. It'll be handy to have it on just for a short time while I'm busy doing something else.

Best,
Jim
