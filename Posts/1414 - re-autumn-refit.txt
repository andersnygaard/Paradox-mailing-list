Subject: Re: Autumn refit

The long trip I did reefed was all on the stbd tack so, as you say, the yard was well away from the mast. My feeling is that this may be desirable as it de-powers the sail more quickly when heeling to the gusts. If you felt there was not enough power then haul up a bit more sail. The fact that there is infinite variation on the reefing, rather than fixed reef points is a great help.

The topping lift increases the time to furl by maybe 5 seconds

The endless line system works well. When I found the chafe I disconnected the furling end and fitted a new furling line, but kept the rest as the halyard. For the rest of the week I was wading through piles of rope on the cabin floor. Now that I have fitted the new fairlead I have reinstated the endless line and the cabin floor is visible again.

There is some tendency for the line to kink, but when I remove the rig I disconnect it from the yard and take the opportunity to run the twists off the end. The kinking has never caused a problem.

So far I can see only two problems that might arise. One is that it is not possible to drop the sail instantly by releasing the halyard as there is only about six feet of slack. The second is that when the rope gets damaged by chafe you have to replace the whole thing. On the whole I reckon the advantages out weigh the disadvantages
