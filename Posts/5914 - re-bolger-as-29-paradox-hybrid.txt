Nels,

That is how one sails with the Glen-L Sharpie design... with the swing keel mostly cranked up.

However with a Hard-Chine boat, the chine itself forms a keel when the boat heels under sail.. forming a vee in the water. My boat tracks fine with the keel all the way up. I think Matt Layden experimented with chine runners because small micro-cruisers like "Little Cruiser" and "Paradox" were so light to begin with and did not sit down as far in the water like a larger boat. Thus the chine runners extend the chine downward about another 4 inches.

The AS29 has twin bilgeboards. So if built as designed could one not sail in the shallows with the boards just lowered a bit and get the same effect as having chine runners?
