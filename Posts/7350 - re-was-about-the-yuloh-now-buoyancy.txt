Sorry, Jim--didn't realize you were in a sensible country using SI units. Anyway, Alistair's idea of simply buoying the ballast is very sensible and much simpler.

Thanks for the response Jeffery

We already know the weight, which is given by the designer as approximately 640 kg. So no need to mess around measuring.

Using the metric system, one kilogram of water is one litre. So, 640 kilograms of displaced water is 640 litres - yes it's that simple. Good, this metric system. Makes life easy.

So if the boat is to be no more than, say, one third submerged - to enable recovery in a rough sea and to keep my delicate body from getting too wet - then the buoyancy required to keep 2/3rds of the boat above the water is 2/3 of 640 litres of trapped air.

So, in rounded figures, more than 400 odd litres of trapped air. That's a hell of a lot of useful living space lost. I reckon that we'll have to compromise. How about if we settle for just enough flotation to prevent complete sinking and except that self-recovery is impossible if we get a big hole in the bottom?

Best

PS. no rain in this part of England today!
