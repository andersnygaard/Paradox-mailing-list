Subject: Re: Charcoal Stove

Thanks to all who offered help. I looked at all the suggestions and pondered over the matter. Trying to heat a paradox cabin would allow me a nice, and longer cruising season. The notion of a kerosene/paraffin lamp for a heater, instead of charchoal would be much cleaner. With no ashes. So, I see a metal can as a heat dissapater,and a chimny thru the roof. The burner/wick assembly from a big lantern in/under the bottom of the can. This should be something to try. Best, Steve Yahn
