I wouldn't think the extra cloth would be any problem. Once the boom and yard are on the deck any loose cloth is going to be draped over the side out of the way. I you feel the need to tidy it up just bundle it up under the yard. The retaining hoop will stop it going anywhere.

Of course in really high winds you won't be able to reef down quite so far ......

A couple of weeks ago i was out in a forecast F5-7. I had about 2 feet of luff unrolled and was still doing over 5 knots. When I took the mast down to go under a bridge I was still doing 2 knots!

Hoping for calm nights
