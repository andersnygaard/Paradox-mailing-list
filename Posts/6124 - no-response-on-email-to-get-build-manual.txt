Subject: No response on email to get build manual

I was trying to delay starting until I could obtain the build manual to avoid extra headaches, but after 2 weeks of no response I'm asking for some help to get a copy.  We still have many questions that hopefully the build manual will sort out. 

I'm buying a few sheets of ply today so my buddy can start on the bulkheads.

Any help would be welcome, thanks
