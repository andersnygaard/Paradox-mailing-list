Subject: Re: Don Elliot's book?

I haven't gotten any reply yet on my request for the book.  I sent another E-mail but don't even know if she is getting it.  Maybe I'll try again in the Fall if I haven't found another boat project to replace this one.  I haven't ordered plans yet and thought I'd get the book first to give me a better idea of what is involved with building the Paradox.  Oh well, it was worth a shot.
