Subject: Re: New guy question about interior finish


I started to use Cetol after a recommendation by Charlie Ward and much prefer it to the teak oils. Much longer lasting. My experience with painting epoxy is that the single pack paints just do not seem to adhere. I thought I had done something wrong with a previous boat but I now have a brand new boat, an Oughtred Gannet, and it was painted with International single pack over epoxy and the paint still chips of too easily. 
What has worked really well and is as good as new today, is the way I fitted out my Keyhaven Scow two years ago. For all marine ply parts, ie rudder, centreboard I used two pack varnish over well rubbed down epoxy. Absolutely still as new, top class, not a mark on anywhere.
For all the hardwood items, ie thwarts, centreboard case top I used only Cetol. Still perfect, the whole boat still looks as new after two seasons use.
