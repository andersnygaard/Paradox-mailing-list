When building my Portuguese Style Dinghy (plans and instructions at http://koti.kapsi.fi/hvartial/dinghy1/simboii.htm) I used the low-tech method suggested by the designer to bend gunwales: http://koti.kapsi.fi/hvartial/bend/bend.htm

Getting it right took quite some time and a couple of breaks, but in the end it worked. If I were to redo it, I would use the same technique, but laminating two thinner layers.
