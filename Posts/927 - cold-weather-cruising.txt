I've done a minimal amount of cold weather sailing aboard Little Cruiser; however, I have spent a fair bit of time aboard her when it was quite cold outside while preparing for the next cruise. What I've usually noticed is that the sun alone shinning in through the windows and my own body heat is sufficient to keep the inside temperatures tolerable; but there are times when it is so darn cold outside that I do eventually resort to using heat. So far the safest method I've used while still on land was a ceramic heater, but I have also used our gas cooking stove set on low when out sailing. In this case, I simply turned on the stove for a few minutes every-so-often, and then the cabin heated up very nicely. Of course don't forget to leave the hatch open a bit to avoid carbon monoxide poisoning.

Now when it comes to serious cold weather cruising aboard little boats, I must say that Matt Layden is again the expert. He once spent a whole winter aboard Little Cruiser in Cape Cod, and he even froze himself in a salt water pond like an artic ship of yester year. If you look at the attached picture which Matt was kind enough to give me, you will see LC frozen in. I learned of this adventure only after I stripped the paint off LC's sides and I happen to notice cuts up forward in the shape of a bow wave. It appears that Matt eventually tired of his winter entombment and sailed through some ice to get out.

One of the things that should make winter cruising more comfortable is the addition of foam in the windows. You can see that Matt did this aboard LC. We happen to also like using foam in the windows because it makes the boat cooler when it is hot and warmer when it is cold. It also reduces condensation dramatically. Finally, warm clothing and a winter sleeping bag will make your trip more pleasant.
