The main reason I wanted a kit was for speed of construction. My idea was not to have a full kit, just the main components. I still think a kit could be produced, but the method of construction would need some thought - the bottom, for example, could be made from 3 layers of thin plywood so that the first one could be stitched to the sides and subsequent layers applied.
