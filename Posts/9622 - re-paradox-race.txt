Hi John,

I will personally put up the prize money. I would like to send the prize money to someone a week before the race and have that person deal with the payouts or any other issues that arise. My responsibility would end there.

There needs to be updates from each boat frequently throughout the race to make it entertaining. Also, it has to be done in a way so that if it is duplicated next year I can compete on a large local lake in a stock paradox.

If you have a handful of people who trust each other, it will work this time. I am sure there is some electronic gadget that will work next time.

William
