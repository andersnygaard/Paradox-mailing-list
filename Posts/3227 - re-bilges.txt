Hi Dave,

I would say it depends on how you finished it, ie 3 coats epoxy, quality primer and paint will stand up with out rot worry, the boat is small enough to "see" if somethings amiss from even the outside. Will the boat sit on a mooring for extended periods?? will it spend a majority of its time under a tarp or in a garage?? I did the 3 coats of epoxy, then petit protect high build epoxy primer and then a quality marine paint and im not worried about it. also if it was built with nails I would leave it natural for inspection I do not trust nails, with flexing they will work there way out and you may not even see that its actually acting like a syringe injecting water into the endgrain of plywood. I tabbed mine S&amp;G style to avoid this whole issue.
