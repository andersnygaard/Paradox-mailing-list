Update 2: 

I had much better success this past weekend using the yuloh. I tested moving my hand position on the handle in various distances from the pivot point. I discovered that I was better able to "feel" and sense the paddle blade in the water when my hand was positioned closer to the pivot point from than my typical point of position. The position I had was with my hand slightly ahead of the rear deck cabin support: my initial position was perhaps one foot ahead of the rear deck cabin support.

Some other testing I performed were the position of my body. I tried facing forward, facing 45 degrees off center, and 90 degrees off center. as well as balancing center and then off center. With all the testing I was able to find sweet spots where I was able to yuloh for a stretch of time with having to lose a rhythm nor a tempo. I also found the yuloh not popping off the ball so much during those sweet spot time.

I noticed that another sailer had used the typical oar U shape looking device instead of the tiny ball. I thought perhaps this may be more efficient because one may be able to turn the blade at a increase angle to exert power and still maintain the placement of the yuloh at its pivot point. When I increase the angle the yuloh pops off the ball.

My next test to add an additional socket in the yuloh toward the handle. By doing so it will extent the blade deeper under the surface of the water and adding more pressure to the yuloh. The change in the placement of the pivot point will require more effort on my part but the thrust should move the boat further -- I tend to think of the effect as a ten speed bike with changing gear ratios as determined by size of gear.

More to follow -- thank you for reading and sharing.
