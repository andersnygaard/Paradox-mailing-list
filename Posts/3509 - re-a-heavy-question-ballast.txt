One school of thought says that, on a flat bottomed boat, you want the transom out of the water, to reduce drag. Others say you want the bow high to help climb over the waves. Obviously what you don't want is it sitting nice and level.  :-P

This is something that has puzzled me and I too have asked about it. The best answer seems to be that it works as it is.
I am replacing my water with lead in the same compartments, my anchors are under the floor behind bulkhead 3 and I'll have about 30kg of water beneath the floor just in front of bulkhead 4. An outboard on the back port (13kg?) and my own, not insubstantial, bulk anywhere in between bulkhead 2 and 4 should make a pretty puzzle for trimming the boat.
I feel safe saying this now because Al has said he'll sort the trim on my launch day, and I have it in writing :0)

Hoping for calm nights
