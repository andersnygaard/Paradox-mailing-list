Intuitively I have to wonder if plywood would end up making as stiff a beam as laminating a solid wood? For one thing at least 1/3 of the grain may be running in the worng direction for best support. You may end up with a "soft" deck. One that will flex a lot. Don't know if that is all that bad, but may be disconcerting. Nels

Seven? I only make it 6 in all! 

Though if one comes out looking a bit dodgy, don't throw it away, 
use it for the supports between the carlins and the vent trunk
