My Fellow Paradoxians,

Well the scarfing is all done, and as of about 11 a.m. this morning the hull was cut out and faired.  I laid out all the bulk head and deck beam locations on the hull panels and called it a day.  If all goes well and according to plan, on Tuesday of next week, three days away, we will do a "dry fit" and I can finally post some 3-D pics of her.  Its quite an exciting time here as we prepare to make sense out of the pile of boat parts collecting in the garage....more to follow and soon...

Safe Passages To All
Greg
