Subject: hydrofoils?

In researching the displacement hull, I noticed that decreasing the weight of the craft (displacement) increases hull speed. Combine that fact with one of my other crazy project ideas - to build a hydroplane-bike, and here's what I came up with.

Since it is probably not feasible to decrease the ballast weight (as it's necessary for keeping the craft from capsizing), I thought it might be useful to allow the mounting of small hydrofoil fins near the front (~100 sq inch or less) to provide a bit of lift.  This would raise the front end of the boat out of the water slightly and may give a bit of extra speed, without compromising counterbalance weight.

The mounting option I was thinking of would involve putting two or more threaded brass inserts into the hull on each side, into which the foil standoffs could be screwed, bipod style.  When the foils are not being used, you could screw brass plugs into the inserts to prevent them from gunking up and compromising your streamlining.

Even if these would not be useful during sailing, it might help you "get the heck out of dodge" by increasing motoring speed and efficiency in case of an emergency. If you got caught out with a gale coming your way, or if a crew member chopped their finger off, you could slap the foils on, and take off with a few extra knots.

There are certainly other sailing vessels that use hydrofoils to great advantage when sailing, but the weight and limited space might make a proper sailable foil too large to be practical - I could see this smaller foil being quite useful though.

If you don't think this is feasible or just think it's a stupid idea, that's fine and I'll take whatever flak I get from this post, but I wanted to bring the idea up to see what others thought and if you have any good reasons for or against it.
