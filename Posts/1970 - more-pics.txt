Subject: More pics

Hi all,

I've uploaded some pics in ParaPlastic/Photos.

The white rod sticking up from the bottom on the divinycell pic is a teflone one. I use them for making tubes and pipes from fibreglass/epoxy.

Lasse is the one known from Chapter9, who sailed BRIS-boat Libra across the Atlantic. He has now also bought a Pinta trimaran.

The blurry "protocol" says "Inspection 5 mars 2004 of Kjell's boat. Grade a. Yrvind". When Sven and I were schoolboys, grade a was the second highest. (Yes, I will remove it).

Mind you, don't miss the last pic, Sven giving paraplastic thumbs up. How about that.

Besides. Does anyone know about those 30 MB you get for photos. Are they the total for the group, or what?
