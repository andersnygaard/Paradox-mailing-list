Subject: Martha: Plans here and first hurdles met.

So finally the plans have arrived. And in very good time as well, I barely had time to (sort of, kind of) clear the garage.

Now I am however meeting my first hurdles. I will present them and see if anyone can help. I am not completely sure about copyright etc so I will be intentionally vague when asking some questions. This is a problem that should not actually be a problem, at least I hope so. I believe that anyone that has the plans themselves will be able to fill in the gaps I leave in.

1. PLYWOOD
Here is my first problem and it is about material thickness. It seems that all the standard thickness of ply in Sweden is often 1mm thicker than US standard. I have encountered this problem before when building kayaks. The solution then was to just go with the thicker ply. A 4mm thick ply kayak is not too bad compared with a 3mm one. I do not know, however, if the extra thickness, and therefore weight, will be too much. I think this will be a non-problem in the end, and I will probably just go with the thicker ones. I would, however, appreciate some input. Either to confirm or discourage. If not, my options are either special order ply, which is a financial nightmare or just planing down 1mm of the boards. I have actually done that with a small model kayak. But that is just a horrible, horrible nightmare.

On a lighter note, my wife will help me to set up a blog. I have found all the blogs I have read so far very helpful and informative. Not mentioning any names but thanks, everyone.

Cheers
Christian
