I wouldn't like to try unbolting my 25lb lead bricks and moving them while at sea! They need the side panels removing first (which means emptying the side bins) and then they need to be secured so that they don't move in a knockdown.

I think if it was deemed necessary to have weight moved forward the easiest thing would be to sit nearer the front of the boat. Not that I have noticed any reluctance to punch through head seas so far.

Hi Glen,
 
That is a great idea. The tradeoff will be the ballast could not be move fore and aft depend on the Sea conditon. I think when one punch through the wave and wind, one need the weight forward. When running with the sea , one need the weight aft.
