Subject: Re: outboard weight

I agree with Al.  I've experimented myself, but I've seen a 'system' whereby the remote tank is filled via a standard remote tank / fuel line / squeezy bulb setup that was connected up via the air bleed screw hole on the integral tank filler cap.  I imagine that once primed, fuel would be sucked into the integral tank from the remote tank as it was used up.

The Suzuki DF2.5 is a very light 2.5hp 4 stroke, weighing just 30 lbs.  I'd be very surprised if there's a lighter outboard of similar spec. on the market.  I have one.  It starts more easily than any outboard I've previously owned, and that's quite a few.  It will easily run at 3/4 throttle for over an hour on one filling.  The tank holds one litre.

Hope that's of use to you.
