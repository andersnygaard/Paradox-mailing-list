David,

Thanks for the offer to take measurements. It appears you've done a little customizing on your boat. I would definitely appreciate that kind of help since I'll be going "off the chart" somewhat. Always willing to take advantage of someone else's hard work and experience!

By the way, I'm in Sebastopol, California, which is west of Santa Rosa, and just east of Bodega Bay and the Pacific. I'm an hour north of the San Francisco Bay. If anyone is planning on being in the area, I'd love to hear your advice about any of my building projects. I learn a lot that way.

Thanks,

Ernie
