As you can see from the example below it can get quite tricky to ascertain if an application for membership is genuine or a potential spammer.

If you are the friend they mention then please tell them to re-apply as I rejected their original application, and requested further information as to why they are interested in this group.

"Hello,

The following person would like to join the paradoxbuilders group:
Email address: julieandjamesharvey <julieandjamesharvey@yahoo.com>

Comment from user:
Its nice to find a group that shares my interests! A friend sent me your link (members already). Love to join. Julie &amp; James

This membership request requires your approval because the paradoxbuilders group is restricted, which means you must approve each new member."

If they are genuinely interested in building a Paradox, then I apologize. If they had mentioned that in their application they would have been accepted.

We do our best to protect the discussion group from spammers but it is amazing how tricky some spammers are.
