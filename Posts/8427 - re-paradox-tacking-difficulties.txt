Subject: Re: Paradox tacking difficulties

That's a very interesting comparison of the 4 boats Dave.

So, do you think that the more sluggish tacking with Paradox is due to lack of a centre board, or more to do with the shape of the sail?

I know what you mean by rolling downwind. Here in the UK we often get winds which are stronger and have noticed the rolling. At times the boat has rolled enough to get  the clew of the sail to dip into a wave.

I've noticed that deep reefing helps and the boat doesn't slow much.

I'm going to try a longer mainsheet during my next trip, to allow the sail to go well forward of the mast. Not sure if this will reduce rolling or make it worse. We'll see.

Best
