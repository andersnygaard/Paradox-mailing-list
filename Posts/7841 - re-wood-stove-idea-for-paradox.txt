Alastair,

What sort of external air temperatures are you experiencing when you are toasty warm without added heat? I know that in this country, what is considered cold in Florida would be considered a heat wave in Puget Sound, and positively tropical in Montana.

I am not often out when it gets below freezing (zero Centigrade) but I have had that a few times. This only happens in the winter when it will be getting dark early so I usually take the opportunity of a good night's sleep and wrap myself in my sleeping bag. A nice hot drink and I am out till morning.

Being inside a foam lined box obviously helps to maintain what heat there is. I know some builders have left out the insulation/buoyancy but, while I agree it is probably overkill in the "swamping scenario", I believe the comfort value is considerable.
