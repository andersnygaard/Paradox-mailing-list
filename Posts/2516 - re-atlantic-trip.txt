Thanks Glen for posting the pictures of Hogfish Maximus. Like everyone else, I especially look forward to reading your article and seeing some pictures of your transatlantic trip.

By the way, if any of you need some West System Epoxy to complete your Paradox, I noticed that Jamestown Distributor has the resin on sale for 20% off. Back in the fall, I got a few extra gallons of the stuff when West Marine had a 20% sale, but I think I may get some more for my spring projects.
