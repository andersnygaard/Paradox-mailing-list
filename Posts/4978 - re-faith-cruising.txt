Hi Bill,

Great stuff! I look at your blog every evening to see if there is any new update.

I don't know the area where you are now, so had to use an atlas to help interpret your latest two reports. I see that you've traveled quite a long way so far. Very impressed. Hat off to you, Sir.

The weather is very chilly at the moment and it must feel perishing cold, even if you sail Faith with the hatch closed. I bet that the hot water bottle will be working overtime for a few days.

If you get the right wind and weather, would you consider sailing non-stop for 48 hours or so to make distance while conditions are favorable? Not sure if you have nav lights, etc., or if Faith can hold a steady course while you get a little nap.

Good luck,
Jim Hall
