Hi Al,

I decided a long time ago not to use the tanks as designed. I intend to either use a flexible tank (or 2) something like this: http://tinyurl.com/2o7azv. That might work, but how do you clean them? At the end of my first season, having only filled the tanks with tap water, I removed the inspection hatches to find a couple of millimetres of jelly coating the whole of the inside of the tank. I was glad I hadn't been using it for drinking.

I'd make up the rest of the weight with lead and stores.

How did the weekend go? Did Jeff manage to get any photos or video of "Little Jim" in the force 5/6?

Discretion took over and I didn't leave Chichester Harbour. It looked quite interesting outside, but the wind would have been on the nose heading for Bembridge so I decided I was too much of a gentleman and stayed where I was.

The lifeboat came out 3 times on Saturday to boats *inside* the harbour (all aground). Thank goodness for a shallow draught.

Hoping for calm nights

Al,
Yeovil, England.
