Subject: Re: Coastal vs Blue Water

For the unconventional boats like Sven and Matt's boats, there's no cockpit, the construction is already heavy for the scale of the boat, there's only one real berth (which may be too wide to be a good sea berth - see below!) and total capacity is limited by the size of the boat.

From what I recall, there are a number of differences between Matt's designs and what Sven decided for his own designs.

Sven decided that divinycell laminates gave better strength/bouyancy/flexibility ratios than plywood laminates.

He rather reluctantly decided to go back to a centerboard rather than chine runners. Better performance in big offshore waves.

His hulls are designed to be highly unstable when inverted and this included a very short mast.

He uses a multi-sail plan with a tops'l gaff and jibs and a spinnake/ballooner of sorts - for light winds.

He uses a double ended design, to add bouyancy in the stern.

He readily admits that his designs are far more expensive and complicated to build, but that this is justified for maximum safety considerations.

Cheers, Nels
