I made all of mine from one jig , with strips of different coloured wood , Kapur and a Hoop Pine ,  laminated with west system epoxy resin and they worked just fine
The ones for the roof needed to be dead accurate to get the roof to slide easily
I made them the same way and sanded the last few millimetres , so they were exactly the same curve On Top .
