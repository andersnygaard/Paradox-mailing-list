Subject: Re: LED navigation lights part 2

Hi Al.

I've very much enjoyed your pieces on LED nav lights, particularly the
bit regarding two wire installation for the anchor light and the
tricolor. This polarity switching makes a lot of sense for remotely
switched red/white combinations down below.

Are your calculations based upon a power supply regulated to 12 volts?
If not, what affect would a charging battery (say, 14.4 vdc) have on
the LED clusters? What about an at rest, fully charged battery,
at 12.6 vdc?

According to COLREGS, our boats only require a white light be shown to
avoid collisions. It is convention that a 360 degree masthead light is
in accordance with the law, and as Glen points out, this all around
white light provides many advantages, with regard both to safety and
legality. With a few exceptions, other vessels must give way to an all
around white.

Also according to COLREGS, our boats must show side lights, steaming
light, and stern light if under power. The stern light and steaming
light may be combined as an all around white, but the side lights may
not be comprised within a tricolor.
