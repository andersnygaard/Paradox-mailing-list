Subject: Re: No response on email to get build manual

Well after I got the guide from another source, I sent paypal payment to the email address and got a copy of the guide from her via email the next day, so... anyhow, I'm glad to have it.

I tried a couple email addresses, until one finally went through. I have received a copy from another source and will paypal the money to the email address that I have. So that problem is solved, my thanks to all that helped out. The mast layout is ALMOST making sense with the build guide info.
