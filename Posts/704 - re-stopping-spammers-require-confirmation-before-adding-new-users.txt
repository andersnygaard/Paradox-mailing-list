Subject: Re: Stopping spammers - require confirmation before adding new users?

Hi Dave,

I agree with you there. If we don't close the group then everyone can
choose their own solution. I'll either go with the summary, or just
let the spam come thru and ignore it. The sender is usually a clue, if
it is just a line of random characters, it goes out.
