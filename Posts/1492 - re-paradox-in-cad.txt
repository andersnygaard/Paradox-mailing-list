Thanks for the compliment, I'm glad you overlook the deficiencies, which is why I usually don't post my work. Of course I guess it's like building your own boat, nobody else see's the mistakes you do.

Yes, as long as the build manual stays free. Let me know if you need different pics of things, then you can see if there are any errors in my detailed pics.

The cad pics on Little Jim were very helpful, as well as Don's building plans, so thanks to them for there effort. I would have been clueless in a number of things.
