Great Roselt,

It would be great to see the pictures and details of the rig!

Keep sailing.

Kind regards

Planktos was launched today in Western Australia. Winds 15 knots with stronger gusts. Ballast - around 90 kg of lead plus some 30kg of chain - definitely light on. I estimate she needs another 100kg in total.

Still no windows which gave me a few nervous moments when we were hit by gusts and laid over up to the gunwales.

Overall I was very pleased with the performance. Considering it was the first launch I was very pleased that the boat sailed well, pointed well and survived the gusts.

It will be interesting to the group members that Planktos is junk rigged with four panels. The sail was modified from a previous junk rigged boat. I am happy with how this side of things went. The lazyjacks arrangement needs rethinking, probably to separate lines for the front and back of the sail.

I will post pictures later.

Only 6 years since I ordered the plans. I look forward to many days of the simple joy of sailing a lovely small boat.
