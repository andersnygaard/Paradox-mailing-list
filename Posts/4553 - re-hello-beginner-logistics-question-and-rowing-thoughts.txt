I guess "trickle" is a bit vague. I was thinking of something like this:

That is 1.26 Watts and for $30 you get a unit that is weatherproof, ready to mount and clips straight to the battery.

It still would not make sense as primary propulsion and extended use would not work, but using an electric around the docks, sailing for one or more days and using it to dock again, you would likely never run out of juice. But I would want a backup generator.
