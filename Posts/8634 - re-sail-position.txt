Thanks Alastair,
Great to hear there's no pointing discrepancy, I only ask as there is on my lugsail dinghy. I forgot to mention my other concern re off centre sail; some people have mentioned the boat's reluctance to tack from port to starboard ( I think you yourself have previously mentioned shifting your weight forward when tacking to help this) -might this be solved by siting the sail on the centre line?

I suspect that if the sail was on the centre line it would exacerbate the problem. As it is the boat can usually be persuaded to fall off on the starboard tack. 

It is not really a big problem. I have only had it arise when I wasn't concentrating. If there is a bit of a chop on the water it is necessary to to get up enough speed before tacking. In winds over F6 it is often better to wear round.
