Subject: Re: New guy question about interior finish

A person may still want to protect the bare wood from getting water stained or darking from grit and age. I found this product to be excellent. Two thin coats applied with a foam brush lasted for 10+ years for finishing the oak cupboards and tables I installed in my camping van. It had the UV tinted glass windows. 

This stuff is considerably cheaper than Cetol.
