Subject: Re: Minimalist sail-inside designs

Cathy,

I would suggest that there are several pram designs that would be adaptable to a Sand Flea configuration. One that comes to mind would be Bolgers Ruben's Nymph.

Full building plans and procedures are in Payson's latest book. The sheer shown would have to be eliminated to have a flat sheer to install a deck over the top and the central bulkhead would have to be lowered to allow sleeping inside. It is raised up in the plans to support the fore and aft rowing seat.

The main source of ballast in a hull this small is the person inside. And being sem-reclined on the bottom keeps it down low. I know this works from my canoeing days, where we often "lined" a canoe down drops with all the stores still inside the canoe.

So with Sand Flea's, quick and easily reefed sail, one could drop it and lie down under the deck and I doubt you could upset it no matter how hard you tried.

I believe Matt has fore and aft sealed bulkheads each side, accessible through deck plates.

This adds flotation as well as storage for water and food etc.
