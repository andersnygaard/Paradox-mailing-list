Hi Fellow Paradoxers,

Enuf has a front deck!
In the end I put grooves in the underside 1 and a half inches apart using a 60 degree router 
bit which allowed a little more flexibility in the panel. 
It was, however, wasted endeavor because it turned out be the top bevel on my sheerstrakes 
being too steep. The deck was meeting the inside edge of the sheerstrake only. Planing, 
filleting and epoxy have sorted it.
The deck has a very sexy curve (for a deck that is)  :0)
