Subject: Re: Calling all Paradox skippers: assessments?

I have not heard of any Paradox owner who has been dissatisfied with his boat. Yes, boats have been sold, but not for reasons of dissatisfaction.

I wrote an 'assessment' of my Paradox back in 07 after cruisng in company with Al. You can find it here:

I wouldn't change a word in the article, except to say that I added a Honda 3.2 outboard engine to the boat for my cruise this year along the South Coast of England to the Scilly Isles.

Paradox behaved extremely well and more than met my expectations.

Over the years I have owned many boats and Paradox has been the most comfortable and driest of them all.

If you want a Paradox you'll have to put in some dedicated sustained work or buy one at the right price, if you can find her.
