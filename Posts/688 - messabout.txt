Subject: messabout!!

Howdy,

I'm new to this group and I'm interested in finding anyone who has built a boat and wants to attend a Messabout. We are going to host one at Lake Okaboji, in NW Iowa. Already have folks interested who live in Minneapolis, Dakota Dunes(SD) and NW Iowa.

This will happen next summer(June-Aug) and we are looking for other participants. Doesn't matter what you might have built, so long as it floats, and looks like it might fit into the definition of a boat.

Please email me off post if you might be interested.

Steve.
