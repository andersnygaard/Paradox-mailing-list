Eerik no wonder you are up on solving sailing's problems with the junkrig. You've been moonlighting over at junkrigassociation.org/technical_forumYour Building a junkrigged Matt Leyden's Paradox thread! wonderful stuff.

A coincidence that you should mention twist. Just this morning I've sewn on 4 new tell tales to the leach of my sail to enable me to get better info on sail set and sail twist is one of big issues with the Paradox which I'd like to address...
