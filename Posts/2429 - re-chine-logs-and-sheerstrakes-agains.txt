Hi Nels

Thanks for your reply; very helpful.
I've used the TRADA website and they say that Sapele takes screws and nails well and it 
glues satisfactorily. That's the one for me.
For anyone else who may be interested the TRADA (Timber Research etc.) website is very 
good. You type in the timber that you are interested in and it gives you a lengthy fact 
sheet with colour pictures of the timber sawn. If the grain configuration changes you get 
more than one pic. Site is at:http://www.trada.co.uk/
If you are UK domiciled it also gives a list of firms stocking the timber. I found one within 
30 miles of home. Hope that this is a help.

Thanks again.....Derek
