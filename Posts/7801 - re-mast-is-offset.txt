Apart from being able to access the forward compartment,
I suspect that the geometry of the mast position, the boom and the way the boom support swings down to the left is carefully calculated.
If you move anything you'll need to redesign the boom support,
and the way the control lines pass through the drain and into the 'cabin'.
I think.

Why would you? If you look at the force vectors the lateral position 
of the sail make very little difference. Being able to quickly stow 
the sail can be invaluable.
