Finlly got in to paradox builders. Yahoo had some confusion with my password or somethin. Anyway been a fan for some time of this design,might even build one someday. Was wondering if anyone has built one with the cabin sides flush with the hull sides. Seems this would really open up the interior and increase righting in case of a knockdown. Any ideas?
