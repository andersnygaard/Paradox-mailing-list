Thanks Glen!

Sorry John I didn't realize you were asking for tape dimensions, I 
just went out and measured mine which was made by Dabbler Sails. The 
tape is 1" or 2" folded in half and put over the luff.

Knowing the size would help getting some on my sail.

Im wondering if the problem most have had with the mk2 sail being that
it creases, I feel that this could be that luff tape was not used, as
this would shrink the luff when in low winds and that would stretch as
the sail fills. Matt mentions the luff tape in the new sail plan. I also
would like to know from anybody that has had a professional sail loft
build the sail if they used luff tape or not. if so what size?
thanks
