Hi Pete.

All the panels were cut indoors, I have a spare room, and assembled outside starting on 10th June this year.

With the building work going on next door, inclement weather and distractions I suppose I have only used my time 20 -25% efficient. If that.

As I have this bloody great hole in the roof of my work area, I can put the blame on the builders if my other neighbour complained.

Far Eastern Ply. I bought this from a boatyard in Cowes here on the Isle of Wight.

I think I should have paid the extra and got some better quality.

I have had a couple of delaminations with the 1/4" decking.

If my new boat works and the ply delaminates badly after a few years, I can always scrap the hull and build another.
