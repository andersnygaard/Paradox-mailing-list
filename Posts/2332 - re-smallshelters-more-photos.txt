Jason,
I am up to $113.00 on cost at this point.
I didn't Bead &amp; Cove the Deck Strips, Just butted then Up, But if I had the tools I would have done that. {Next Boat...}
The Deck is probably not as Hefty as it looks, I can still pick up the Bow with one hand {:>. {I'll get the scales out when I get a little further along.}
I plan on starting out with about 200 Lbs of Ballast and got from there. That should be enough to keep it right side up for now-I Hope! As I have stated I am building this boat for Rivers, lakes and Streams, It will probably never see saltwater as long as I own it. {Not too many Oceans here in Colorado..

Thank you, I should have more Photos posted in the next few days.
