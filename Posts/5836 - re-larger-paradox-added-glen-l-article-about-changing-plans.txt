Hi Chris!

I am familiar with the Bolger Advanced Sharpie 29 [AS-29], it's a good design. It is a descendant of the "Jessie Cooper" a design I like even better without the blunt bow. You can see the Jessie Cooper page here:

One thing I like about the Paradox design is that, like a kayak, it is completely self-righting and self-rescuing. It can roll completely over and right itself. Many commercial model sailboats are only self-righting to a point, 90 degrees being common. Most will not right themselves if they completely capsize and turn turtle. You may find this link interesting or helpful too:

My interest is to construct a shallow keel boat capable of an Atlantic crossing single-handed, and able to carry significant cargo and stores.

I thought this was a very informative post. I'd also like to add that there are other boats that are VERY close to the Paradox that one could do comparisons with. I have the plans for the AS-29, which is much like the paradox (under the water). By comparing current boats (like the AS-29), one can guesstimate what scantlings would be appropriate.

Most who build boats never finish them. At the same time, it is informative, educational, and FUN to play mental games about "what if's" and build them in your head. Many non-professional people have built boats and have had a good experience doing so.
