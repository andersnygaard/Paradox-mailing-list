Thank you to all for adding to my knowledge of my fun ship

Yes at higher speeds the sail is dipping into the sea , and I can't take my eyes off the horizon for more than a few short seconds or the boom swaps sides violently , then it's another crunch as I reset the boom back to the correct tack .

The wind followed my course around a bombing area at sea here , as I needed to turn to find my destination the wind obligingly swung behind me , all day ? The range was active testing cannon , boom boom all day , and a patrol boat is out when they fire live ammunition , making sure you stay outside of the drop zone .

I had to contour the coast,  as I did , the wind as I said , obliged , my fastest day ever , arriving in a tidal port three hours early , I anchored and slept till the tide allowed me to dock .

My chine runners are ever so slightly concave on their top edge , maybe that's the problem , I was sanding them into that shape as it looked more hydrodynamic ?
Any way , I will reduce sail and move weight way forward , I have a lot of anchor chain in stock and it can go way foreword to tip the balance point

Thanks everyone
Nick
