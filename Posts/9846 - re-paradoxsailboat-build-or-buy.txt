I started out wanting to build a Paradox when I found someone here had one for sale, and now I'm considering buying one instead of building one. Does anyone else know of any Paradox's for sale? 

I bought the Paradox Builders Manual by Don Elliott and he said he thought it would take the average Builder four months to build and he said the wood cost him $200 (but that was 20 years ago). The guy that's selling one said he thought the total materials might be $2000 but he said I should ask the group here. Has anyone here kept track of what the total materials cost is these days? And any estimate of how long it would take the average builder to complete? These numbers would help me decide to build or buy. 

I will also need a trailer if I build, so if anyone has one for sale or can help me find one I sure appreciate it. Thank you.
