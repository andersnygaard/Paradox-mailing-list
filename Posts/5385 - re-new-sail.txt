Subject: Re: NEW SAIL

I made my rod from .500 inch diameter stainless steel rod. I used an oxy-acetylene torch to heat and bend it. I am looking for a suggestion as to a good sailmaker. Any suggestions out there/ USA please. I may try a white tarp sail just to get going quickly. I already have just the right tarp too. Steve Yahn

That is an excellent tip.

I wonder how long the gap could be without affecting the performance to some degree?  Could you go 8-10 inches I wonder? Or is that too big? It would have to be half-round would it?

The distance from the forward end of the boom to the centerline of the mast is pretty well fixed by the length of the tack strop pipe and the amount of curve in the swivel rod so is not adjustable right?  Unless of course you make a new pipe, or more or less curve in the rod. Anybody find out the best way to bend a brass rod or does everyone use copper pipe?

Hey Stephen. who are you getting to make your sail? Is there any sail maker in the USA who is recommended? How about Sailrite kits?

Any recommendations on shaping the boom so the new sail lies flat when furled?

I'm thinking it should be fatter right below the fullest section of the sail.

   I believe getting the sail made to Matt's suggestions is a very important component to the performance of the boat.
