It is curious that thirty odd years ago the IMO (International Maritime Organization) tried to come up with aninternational standard system of buoyage. They failed because certain countries did not want to change, so they agreed to disagree essentially. In north America we have predominantly a lateral system, and in some places a cardinal system. The lateral system is the red/green etc. the red right return stuff. The cardinal system is based on the points of the compass, nort south east west......
Red right return is a handy axiom, but it would be wise to understand what it really is about. The 'Starboard hand buoy' (the red one) should be on the right if you are travelling in the direction of the flood tide. This can be a bit confusing on the BC coast unless you know the direction of the flood which is not always easily apparent, between all the islands.....

Hi there

There are places on the planet where the axiom is not ....'red, right return'. Among some foreign countries, there is a region between the east coast of Vancouver Island and the west coast of the BC mainland that also apply. 

These details are usually shown around the title or legend.

Lets see if I can remember this without cheating and looking it up.... If Im lookin at a red light I yield the right of way unless other rules come into play. (motor,cargo, etc.)

There is a little ditty that goes with the words PORT and STARBOARD. It 
goes; "IS THERE ANY RED PORT WINE LEFT?" So this way it helps you 
remember that the red running light goes to the left side of the hull, 
called PORT and the green running light goes on the right side called 
STARBOARD. When your tired and maybe seasick and maybe a little scared, 
all these little things are a help, at least it has been for me. Good 
Luck, Steve Yahn

Was looking at plans and I wondered what p&amp;s meant ... its usually used after a measurement for a cleat or some such.

Thanks for helping out in advance,
Rod
