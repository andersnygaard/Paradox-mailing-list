I posted a drawing of the topping lift arrangement I came up with but am not sure if was in the files section or just in a post. Yahoo is currently down so I will have to wait awhile to check. I will post the drawing and some pictures of the blocks ect. to a folder in the files section called, of all things, Topping Lift. For now you could do a search of the group messages for "topping lift" to see if it is there. At any rate I will post the new folder as soon as I can access the data base again.
