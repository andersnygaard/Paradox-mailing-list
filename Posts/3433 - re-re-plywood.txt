****Jim replies


Does traditional wood hold their price?

***A little confession. I'm not really an enthusiastic
boat builder type. It's merely a means to an end. I
would be capable enough of doing it - having built one
before and working on the tools all my life for a
living. 


*** I have the same doubts Neil. If it's all
encapsulated in something impervious, any water that
gets in can't get out.  It only needs a very minor
break or damage to the shield for water to soak
through the ply I s'pose.

Might be better to spend more on better ply and miss
out the expensive epoxy stuff. Might give a more
durable boat at less final cost.  I gather that the
glass/ epoxy treatment is to compensate for
shortcomings in ply quality.

***Point taken.
