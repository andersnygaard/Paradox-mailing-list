Hello Andre.  Ive not been able to sail for a few years due to family issues and my own head injury.  I think I’m getting better, but most of my boats have to go.  Anyway, I’ll be selling my Enigma 460 this spring.  Just a thought if you may be interested.

Hello Paradoxians,

Happy New Year;

I concur with Andre that the paradox sailing on the great lakes is not much a boat design issue; watching weather, and conditions is important as with any sailing. Some parts of the great lakes are much more interesting than other parts.

I have met Andre, who is very knowledgable regarding these boats, and his boats are solid.

My paradox is closer to the City of Oswego, southern eastern part of Lake Ontario. I would be happy to sail and meet other paradoxians for sailing adventures. Going across from US to Canada is problem because of the virus. I have the original design sail shape as per Matt L. It is effective and simple.  Contact me if you wish to learn more.

Looking to sail Lake Champlain this spring/summer.

Steve, Cory, -  I hope you eventually get sailing on a paradox. It is a great boat. Let me know when you are ready to sail.
Mike, - you are not too far,,, if you get a dox or any other shallow water boat, let me know so we can do a sail.

Stay safe and sail on,
Deric
