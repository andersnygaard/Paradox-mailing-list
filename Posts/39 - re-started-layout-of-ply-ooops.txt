Hi Al,

Sorry I calculated it for the rear panel, so I recalculated it for the front, I only get 2.5 cm overlap using maximum slop. 
If you tilt the side panel you should have on problem. However it been a while yet I don't recall having any problem. I must not have because I didn't buy another sheet. Tilting the 115 base line should give you more than enough room around the parts. Don

Hoping for calm nights
