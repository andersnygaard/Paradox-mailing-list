Hi Brian et al...

For when my Paradox is too much boat, on small lakes without a ramp for example, I built myself a "Paraduck", which is a cross between a Puddle Duck Racer and a Paradox. Took me 4 to 6 weeks to build. Most of the advantages of the Paradox but a much simpler build.  It can be sailed from the inside like the Paradox when it rains and I can sleep in it very comfortably.  It is much slower than the Paradox, but who’s in a hurry?  Especially for exploring small lakes, I just love it.

This is my own design, based on the standard PD Racer hull.  8 feet long, 4 feet wide.  Reefable sprit sail.  Fits in a pickup truck or standard trailer.  I named it "Gorfnik", wanted a weird name which did not exist.

I'll post a picture on the "Gorfnik" album.  Let me know if you would like details of the build.  May be more suitable for the Microcruising group though.  Only kinda Paradox related.

Curwensville lake looks nice, maybe I should drive down with Gorfnik!

Have a nice day,
