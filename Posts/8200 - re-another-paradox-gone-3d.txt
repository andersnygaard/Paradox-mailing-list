I tried with a camper's type sleeping mat too, Alastair, but it soon became so dirty and smelly, although given frequent scrubs, that I abandoned it.
I slept on a Thermarest camping mattress for a good while after that but had to abandon that too after it developed a slow puncture which I couldn't fix 

I've since made a super duper luxury sleeping pad.  Two layers of closed cell foam, each 20mm thick, with a 50mm layer of memory foam over that and all glued together .
The whole is fitted into an  envelope made from leather look vinyl,  which I sewed up with  my vintage Singer machine . 

It's water proof and wipes clean and very tough but fairly heavy.  .I leave it down in the cabin all the time except when I'm needing to get to the underfloor lockers. It's too big and stiff to roll up for stowing foreward. anyway. Nice comfort for when you want to sit inside with the hatch shut

It's 2 foot wide so doesn't cover the entire  cabin sole but leaves a bit clear.  for food prep or whatever. I always take my shoes off while in the boat.. BTW

Best
Jim
