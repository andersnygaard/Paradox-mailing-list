Subject: Re: Autopilot setup

Glen, what a clever and simple idea!

I have an Autohelm out in the shed, and I plan to use a steering line system on my little cat, so I will definitely duplicate your setup.  I hate to carry the weight of a wetcell battery, but I require a fishfinder.  There are some small motorcycle batteries that don't weigh quite as much as a car battery; they won't run the Autohelm for very long, but I'll only need it occasionally and briefly.

The rolling hitches would, I think, also make for a simple tiller lock on a steering line system.
