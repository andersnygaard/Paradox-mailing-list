I am not an engineer. I can only guess at the correct strength. I would use the aluminum tube you have as the Boom. Not for the Mast. For the Mast, I myself, would feel good using a tube of diameter 73mm or 88mm. with a wall thickness of 5mm. I would feel even better using wood. In the event of real disaster the wood floats. Try to use the opinion of several people. Not mine only.

Good Luck
