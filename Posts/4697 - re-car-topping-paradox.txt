Hi James.

ENIGMA is built from 1/4" topsides and 3/8" bottom.
My PARADOX sized "ENIGMA" is built from the same sized materials.
By reducing the draught to 7" and tweaking on the computer I have shaved off just over 1/3 of the weight on PARADOX.
Empty I think for a laugh she could just be cartoppable :-)
My location is on the Isle of Wight.
And its bloody raining.
