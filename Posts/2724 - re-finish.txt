Thanks Nels - feeling much better today

How much more of the build do you have left?
The hull is near complete: decks to go on, trimming of chine runners, sheathing the whole in fibreglass, building and fitting the cabin top and making the mast and spars although I've only got to glue the mast up. I cut the blanks awhile ago.

That is what I'm hoping. I'm going to leave my traditional waterproofs at home.
I've just been lent an old Moulton Stowaway bicycle that breaks in half and looks like it will fit up front. it should extend my range for beer sampling trips.

i have read about this and our English weather is slowly improving so I expect to be able to pick warm, balmy days for finishing.

I'll do this

Cheers Nels and thanks again  ....  Derek
