Subject: Re: Video - Paradox Scout...2nd shakedown sail....20+ knots of wind.

Hi Sean,

I watched your video and was flabbergasted. You must be one hell of a sailor to go out on your second time with winds like that. When I took my Paradox out the first time, I really had to take it easy to figure everything out. Unfortunately, I haven't had a chance to take it out a second time yet, because I'm in Qu=C3=A9bec and Ironsides (I might change the name to something bilingual) is in Olympia, Washington state, 5500 km from here. But one thing is for sure, my second time will also be in lighter winds. I obviously have a lot to learn.

Congrats on finishing Lezlie's boat and on your success at sailing it. I was in lake Havasu last Christmas and recognized where you were sailing, just in front of the Park. Great spot!

Sure wish you would tell us more of your impressions other than =C2=ABthe boat sailed magnificently=C2=BB. How does it compare (or not) with all the other microcruisers you have tried at the annual fest you host?

Looking forward to hearing from you. Congrats also to Lezlie for such a fine looking build. I will talk of my own impressions and adventures in another post (long story).
