Still real early in my build, had a setback for a couple of weeks, so I dont really know if this is helpful or not. Just saw Stephen's concrete ballast (cool temporay idea), was thinkin, what about trying to obtain some weight lifting machine plates? I'm no jock but didn't these used to be made of lead or only cast iron? I wonder if old high school gyms might have these? Or would modern ones do it? Sometimes weight plates can be found real cheap at pawn shops and 2nd hand stores. Anyway just a thought.. getting concerned early as I hadn't thought of recent enviromental issues making this an expensive componet.
