Subject: Re: New Paradox Odyssey is launched

I did the capsize testing, I mean I was the force hanging on the mast :)  and I'm heavy, with drysuit I guess in a range  of 240-260 lbs.

Alexander has already the ballast at the upper design level, I don't know exact numbers, but he added some after initial launching. 
Anyway at about 45 degrees tilt the boat is going down fast with my weight hanging on a mast. I let the mast go quickly since the boat was loaded and we didn't want to ship much water inside.

However in last capsize video

we have Alexander inside and I flipped the Paradox to about 90-100 degrees and couldn't get it going down any further.
