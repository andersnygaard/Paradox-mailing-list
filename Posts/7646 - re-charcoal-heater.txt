Subject: Re: Charcoal Heater

<p>I just added a CAD drawing for a version of this heater I came up with.&nbsp; I have not tried it except for paper models.&nbsp; The plan is for making a 2&quot; diameter X 5&quot; high Micro Charcoal Heater out of flat sheet metal like stainless steel.&nbsp; I&#39;m thinking maybe a cheap stainless steel stock pot from the dollar store might work as the metal although it is fairly thin.&nbsp; It would have to be brazed or silver soldered together unless you have access to a TIG welder.&nbsp; There is a 1&quot; diameter X 2&quot; high section for connecting a 1&quot; flexible exhaust pipe for a flue.<br></p>
<p>Pipe would probably be easier but this might be another option.&nbsp; I didn&#39;t draw up anything for the doors.&nbsp; You will have to figure that part out for yourself.</p>
