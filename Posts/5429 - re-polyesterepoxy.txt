Hi there

In another life I worked at Industrial Formulators (Cold Cure folks). We would never recommend epoxy over polyester. You can seal the wood with an epoxy sealer and then laminate with an epoxy resin.

Hello friends 

As you will have seen in the photos, I'm building a Cachivache yard 
open. I want to impregnate wood and I thought about giving them a hand 
of polyester resin diluted. Some, for these latitudes claim that after 
I will not be able laminar with epoxy resin on the layer of polyester. 
Someone can advise? 

Thank you 
Alberto
