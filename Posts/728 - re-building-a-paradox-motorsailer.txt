Subject: Re: Building a Paradox (motorsailer?)

Thanks for your response Al,

I'm not interested in a canal boat. It is just that some of the lakes where I will hopefully be sailing  are connected by small rivers with bridges and weirs, somewhat similar to canals. The motorboats regularly move from one lake to the next, while the sailboats are stuck in whatever lake their home marina is located. I was under the impression that Paradox could be scaled upwards without it becoming a sow's ear.

The notion of dumping raw sewage overboard, is not a part of my being a responsible person. Not to mention being illegal. How do you plan to handle that rather delicate subject?
