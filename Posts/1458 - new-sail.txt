Hi all, Glen in particular

I have plotted Matt's new sail measures on the sail plan in the drawings.

Assuming tack-point and foot-angle constant, throat-point tilts
forward/downward, peak-point forward/upward (I guess this is what
means "higher aspect ratio"). The luff/foot angle is now no more 90
dgr (or 91) but 95, thereby making the "foresail part" of the sail
slightly larger. Two questions arise:
1. To keep the foot/boom at constant angle calls for a new
attachment-point for the halyard to the yard, from 700 to 900 mm from
front end of yard. Judging from Glen's NS-photos it looks like the old
measure has been kept.
2. Measuring perpendicular from foot to peak, resp. tack/foot to yard,
there is 6% more sail to furl in the aft part of boom and 6% less to
furl in the fore end of the boom. This means that it takes about 10mm
larger circumference in the aft end, resp. 10mm lesser circumference
in the fore end of the boom, for the sail to reef and furl properly.

Is there any reason for making these adjustments, or is this a futile
discussion? Perhaps we should discuss how many angels there could be
dancing on a pinpoint instead.
