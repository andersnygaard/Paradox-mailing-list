Hi All,

I have really put Whisper to the test the past couple of days. I'm not worried about her pointing any more. I was keeping up with the bigger boats, not pointing as high but keeping up really well. But I am having trouble getting her to bring her nose around into the wind to start another tack. I have not been able to do it without the help of the motor. I have been able to jibe, but not every time (very few). What am I doing wrong? I have had no trouble doing it on my sloop rigged boat. Any suggestions?

I can verify the sound design of the hull! About 11:30 one night at anchor, I was woken by a drunk jet skier smashing into the side of Whisper. I'm not sure how fast he was going, but by the way she rolled and the scratches, he wasn't idling! He could tell I was not a happy camper and took off. Nobody was hurt and only cosmetic damage to Whisper. She is a great boat guys. Keep on building!

David
