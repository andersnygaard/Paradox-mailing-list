Anyway, I sit for hours and hours and hours during our winter trips, and it has literally save my @ss. Below are some links to my pictures to give you an idea of what to look for if you want some. By the way, a little Googling reveiled that airex foam is still available. You might check out http://www.bobsfoam.com/airex.html for more information.
