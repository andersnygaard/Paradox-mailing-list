Subject: Re: Sail position

My boat sails much better to windward on port tack when the mast is to
leeward. I'm sure it's because the luff is better supported.

I'm not sure moving the sail to the stbd side would have any effect at all.
The boat would be unaware of it! The same center of lateral effort goes
down through the mast foot. Plenty of biplane rigs around that work fine even when only flying one sail!
