Subject: scam alert 
Date: Thu, 23 Sep 2010 13:38:50 -0700 (PDT)

Hello everyone, 

I want to pass on this scam alert; someone I know received this call: 

Someone claiming to represent Microsoft calls you and says MS has identified a virus on your machine and provides a number which he says is the registration number for your version of Windows. He also provides a toll-free number (888-847-4674) for you to call to have the virus removed free of charge. If you actually do that, you will be walked through a process that lets the people at the other end take control of your computer, and of course, retrieve all personal data on the machine.

Don’t do it. Microsoft does not do this and it is a scam to gain your personal information.
