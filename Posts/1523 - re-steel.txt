Subject: Re: Steel?

The same thing dawned on me later on, what would be the thickness of choice?? 3/16 ? 

Of course flotation would be used, I would use 2 part mix foam, and I would coat the hull to stop the condensation. Also wood could be used for topsides and interior stuff.

Bill, would this make opening up the bulkhead near the mast for more room possible?? seems to me It would.

Also the cabin/pilot house could be made a bit fancier with steel, ie conning tower :)

Advantages would be that you would be a bigger speck on the radar of other vessels??

downside is you would have to have the compass fixed mounted and calibrated to the boat, im sure there is another name for this procedure.

I have a lincoln wirefeed 110 welder :) I used to do ornemental Iron work years ago, so Im at least capable.

Going with an all steel boat might even be possible to to the adjustable chine idea.

I like the stitch and glue boat building as there are no nails steel being even better... being a carpenter I do not want to be impaled buy the largest silicone bronze hairbrush known to man.

I can handle the splinters.  A steel hull at least you have the forward crumple zones, hhahahhahahha

till I can think out more..
