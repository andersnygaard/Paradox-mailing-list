Hi Guys,

You also have to remember that if you install the foam floation under the gunwales, and if your in a swamped state, that you remove ballast and bail it out. I left my forward compartment open, at 5 foot 7 I can actually enter the forward compartment when its empty. but if you just crawl the front of your body you can get inside to retrieve things, I store things that are boyant and not used often. I often sail with a buddy thats almost 6 feet tall, yea we fit. On another note, behind the rear bulkhead would also be boyant from foam floatation and the air trapped. the more time you spend with this boat the more you see the genius that it is. I would recomend to any super sizers to contemplate the enlarged paradox files that are in I think the files section.
