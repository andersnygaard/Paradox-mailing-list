I explained, of course, to Sven our previous discussion. So he understood that his book was not going to be thrown out in the space just like that. (but still I dont really understand how a cooperative effort should be handled without being pretty loose and unsafe).

Anyway, after having discussed this with him once more; he doesn't approve of the idea of an e-book. Finding an english-speaking publisher is another thing, which interests him greatly. His suggestion is that "Chapter9" might be used as a sample to present to a publisher, if anyone knows one (Bill, please feel addressed). Then, a professional translator should do the job he says (and not me, I suspect he thinks).
