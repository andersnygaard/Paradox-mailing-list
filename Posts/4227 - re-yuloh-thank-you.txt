Subject: Re: Yuloh - thank you

Hi Bill,

I use an old Chinese style yuloh, from the handle to the blade tip it has about 150mm curve (like a bow) - it is the same length as the one drawn on the plans. The blade is 150mm wide and is flat on the underside (forward) and curved on the top edge. It does not need a rope to the handle and works well. I got the design from the Mariners Catalog, volume 3. Hope this is not too confusing.

Regards, 
Hugh
