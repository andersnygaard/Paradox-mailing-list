Hi guys

Regarding batteries in wooden boats.....

I would make sure the areas you decide to put the batteries in are extra  
extra well expoxied and glassed, as well as rinsed out very very often with  
mucho grande amounts of water and perhaps even a final rinse of a neutralizing or 
buffering solution.

Man, thats a long sentence :)

Anyhoo, getting even a trace of battery acid into the wood will destroy it  
faster than an army of termites with buy one get one free food coupons....

take care
