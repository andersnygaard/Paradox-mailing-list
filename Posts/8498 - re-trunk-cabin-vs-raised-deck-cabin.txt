I don't know about reducing the visibility, it certainly wouldn't improve it.

I would miss the side window at the rear corner of the cabin as that is where I rest my shoulder when in normal relaxed sailing mode. Going forward would be more difficult and, with your weight higher up, there may be a stability problem (for us heavier types, anyway) and, as has already been stated, the neat sail stowage would be lost.

Given the choice I would stick with the designed layout.
