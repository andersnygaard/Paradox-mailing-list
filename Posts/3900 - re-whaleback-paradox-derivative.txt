Hello Paul.  I saw your post on Micrusing, and checked out your website pictures.  I'd like to hear about your boat, how you got there, and where your going.  Like, why did you make the sides flatter than the Paradox?  Or, why did you not just build the paradox in a larger size?  Not that I'm advocating either, but I learn from others thought experiments.

I'm planning on building a .33% larger Paradox.  I'm planning on chubbing up the top deck some and making it a bit like Bris.

Let's hear about your ideas!
