Subject: What a wonderful little boat. . .

Let me just reinforce this point: I am so amazed with what all of you have done with these boats, it has been keeping me up nights just looking at them again and again. Truthfully, if I could have a boat as nice as ZOE, or for that matter ANY ONE OF THEM I would have a big smile on my face. 

All of this business about canting the sail maybe something, or it may not be anything. I'd rather just have something that works and has been sailed first. I was a little confused by the instructions for Matt's new sail, have any of you made one of these? Is there a picture of it somewhere? 

I'm going to have to search the archive more regarding that cool sink tap (I don`t see how it facilitates pumping water back out), and that process for attaching the copper to the haul is a mystery to me. 

Wow, it is the little details that I have to look at a number of times before it sinks in how ingenious they are. I'm going to stop asking questions though, until I'm actually looking at the full scale drawings and have read Don's articles/booklet. 

Amazing. Wonderful.
