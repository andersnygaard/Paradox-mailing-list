Sorry for posting a reply on the design. I just figured out you're well into building it now. Nice progress.

Hi Paul,

Thanks for posting the information.

I like the idea of extending the cabin out to the sides of hull. I think it'll make it slightly easier to build. It'll definitely maximize interior space.

If I was drawing the boat, I'd increase the beam a little and make the hull lines fuller in the ends of the boat. I believe that will help the boat stand up to its rig and make it sail better. I'd probably make the transom a bit wider too for the same reason.

Cheers,

John
