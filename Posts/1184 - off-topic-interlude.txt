Hi folks. Please forgive my rare digression.

I receive a (often) daily edition of 'Lectronic Latitude, from Latitude 38, a fabulous sailing magazine based in the San Francisco Bay area. Today's edition includes a streaming video clip (sailing), which I thought some would enjoy. It's located about midway down the page..."If A Photo Is Worth A Thousand Words,......." 

On a cost/benefit basis, I wonder how the <14' Paradox design compares.
