Hello Rob,

Putting a slight curve in that bulkhead frames adds a lot of strength to the whole structure.

As for your options, I suggest going with option 2 and buying a new piece of plywood. It will save you time and effort in the long run and ensure that the curvature is consistent across all bulkheads.

Best regards,
