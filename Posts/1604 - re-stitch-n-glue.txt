Yea,

  Sounds right smaller is easier to repair or deal with at the moment.
easier to stow a replacement or two also.

The windows could be make out of thicker material, but that isn't the best solution.  The best would be to make smaller windows, say three per side.  On a Siren 17 I had, which had long windows, I added aluminum angle support brackets on the inside middle of each one.  I attached the angle to the cabin above and below the window, and put a piece of rubber between the plexiglas and the angle to aborb some of the shock load.  If building from scratch I'd go the three window route so as to not have all my eggs in one basket.  Windows do get stove in.  (See Kenichie Horie's story as an example.)

In all seriousness, 

   IF one was to go the S&amp;G route, when it comes to the deck, and cabin area, the study plans show the default cabin, i would like to stretch the top a bit forward, leaving the rear the way it is for entering the boat from the water, now also to make it more "open water capable" what can be done to upgrade the windows, and or what would be a good reason for not adding any to the front, ie wind, too much boyancy etc etc. most likely to just past the mast.

I don't know about the bilge keels, but a carbon fiber crow's nest has
possibilities.
