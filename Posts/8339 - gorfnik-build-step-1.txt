Subject: Gorfnik build Step 1


Hi all,

I copied the plan for Gorfnik from the PD Racer site and would like to give thanks to David «Shorty» Routh for providing it for free.

For step 1, I cut 4 patterns, 18 inches high, from 1/4 inch fir exterior grade plywood. Then, I sandwiched the 4 pieces and sanded all of them at the same time so they were identical. I checked their consistency by inverting their order in the sandwich.

You can find photos in the Gorfnik album.

Best regards,

[Your name]
