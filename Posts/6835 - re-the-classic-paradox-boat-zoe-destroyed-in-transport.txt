TheM,

Yes it really is tragic. I mean, how often does a trailer burn? What can be the origin of a road fire in an otherwise empty enclosure? But it is what it is. I am certainly shocked and very depressed. You are right, the workmenship and care put into Zoe (which had many nice touchs) cannot be economically produced by a boat builder.

If I live long enough, perhaps one day I will have a second shot at a quality paradox...till then, a very fine boat that has seen a lot of adventure is no more.

WOW, that is really sad news.  The measly insurance to cover the purchase price would never cover replacing it.  If you went to a "real" boatbuilder and had them build a Paradox like ZOE you would have to spend 20K to get it done.
