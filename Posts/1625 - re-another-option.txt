Subject: Re: Another Option

Hi Nels.

Ultimately, what stays is up to Glen, of course. As this is the Paradoxbuilder's group, it would seem that subjects not pertaining directly to Paradox, might be better placed on Boatdesign, or Microcruising, both of which encompass a greater spectrum within the realm of general material and design choices of small boats.

Alternate material choices of various group members has been discussed, and I look forward to reading accounts and viewing photos of the various incarnations of Paradox. 

I may be all wrong, but it seems that if photos of aluminium maxi-RIBs are posted, why not trim-tabs, or fighter-jet cockpit canopies, etc..? 

Respectfully,
DC
