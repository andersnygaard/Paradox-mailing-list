Generally speaking, the fairer the sheathing, the easier it is to apply the fibreglas and the better it will adhere and the less expoxy it will take to fill the weave. (That is if you are referring to plywood as being the 'sheathing'.

The darker the color and the glossier the paint is, the more prominent will be any cosmetic irregulaties.

As for painting, most experts recommend that you apply two thinned layers of paint while sanding off the gloss between coats then use the fairing or filler to smooth out the low spots. This is to prevent the fairing compound being absorbed and losing it's holding ability. 

Then apply more coats of paint sanding off the gloss between coats, until you get the level of finish you are happy with. If you do all this the first time then you should be good for several years before it needs any more paint. So doing it correctly in the first place saves a lot of hard re-finishing work later on. The boat will stay clean easier and go faster too.

Most of my contacts recommend bottom paint no matter what kind of water you are sailing in. There are little critters everywhere:-)
