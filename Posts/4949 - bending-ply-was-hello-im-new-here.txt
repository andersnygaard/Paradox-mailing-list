Subject: Bending ply-(was 'hello i'm new here)

Seems to be several threads going here, all under the same header, so started a new one...

Wood bends better if heated or wet or both(steamed).

For a moderate curve you can try leaving it on a damp lawn in the sun, the top side shrinks, the bottom expands and voila! Had this happen to some studs meant for garage wall!! Turned them over and 'did' the opposite side and they became useable again.

Cheers,
Alan.
