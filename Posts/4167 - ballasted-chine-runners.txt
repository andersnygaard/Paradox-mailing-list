Subject: Ballasted Chine Runners

Would there be any benefit of casting lead onto the chine runners instead of pigs inside the craft? Wouldn't this effectively put them as far to the edges as possible, providing the maximum anti-heeling force?

Are the wood runners/fillets above the bottom plate very structural, and would replacing them with lead affect the structure poorly?

This would mean that the weight was permanently added to the boat - instead of being able to remove the pigs for easier loading/unloading. That is, unless some cleverness with bolt-ons could be concieved.

Anyway, I was just wondering if this would improve the righting force substantially. It certainly would add a bit of stowage or tank space, and maybe even improve the side impact resistance a bit!
