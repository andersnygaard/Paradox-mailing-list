Good to see all this clarified, thanks. I guess most of us have pondered these obstacles. 

One thing though is still unclear to me: what is this "6mm ply scab"? My English-Swedish dictionary does not give any sensible alternative to "scab". And what about its function? So far, I have just omitted this item.
