I notice there dosen't appear to be a rubbing strake on Paradox. Is this not seen as necessary? Also where does one secure fenders? There don't seem to be many obvious tie off points.

I love that fairlead on Zoe (in fact I love everything about Zoe - if I can finish a boat like that i'll be a happy man). I'm just wondering if it's enclosed enough to prevent the rode jumping out if you're pitching a bit in a seaway (not that you should be!). If it jumped out it could make a mess especially without the rubbing strake.

For UK builders:
Has anyone used Robins of Bristol Elite Marine Ply? I can't see any point in going for their better grade stuff.

Is the UK Epoxy Resin http://www.epoxy-resins.co.uk/ as good as the West system? It seems to be a bit cheaper (counting pennies here).

Thanks,
Pete
