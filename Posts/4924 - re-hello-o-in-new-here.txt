I think it is important to realize that Matt's original plan was not
to have a motor, so one has to take that into consideration before
deciding on building a Paradox.

If you feel it is essential to have a motor taking into account your
level of sailing skill, personal fitness, sailing area and time
available to be out on the water, then one should consider choosing a
design that has what you want already designed into it.

Ideally a free draining and vented motor well is the best option for
safety, convenience, and storage of dangerous products as well as
muddy one you don't want in your living space.
