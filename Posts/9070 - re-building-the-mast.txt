Subject: Re: Building the mast

Hi Aman, Welcome.

This question keeps coming up.

I found a link to the last time it was discussed here. I hope this link works.

https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/paradoxbuilders/conversations/topics/8869 

Also, Lezlie wrote a useful article about the mast building (and interpreting the drawing) here:

(This last one was mentioned in a thread in this group a few years ago, too)

I hope these help.

Matt
