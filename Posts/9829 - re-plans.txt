For those looking to acquire the Paradox Build Manual by Don Elliott, please consider the link below. The web site was built by Josh Elliott, Don's son, who is offering the manual along with several other Don Elliott documents. One needs only to submit payment to download the manual. Wanda Elliott does not need to be involved with the transactions. No wait time.

Happy Building,<br>
