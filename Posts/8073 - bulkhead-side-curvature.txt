Subject: Bulkhead side curvature
Date: 27 Nov 2014 15:31:27 -0800


Hello,

I've cut out bulkhead 3 (no others yet) and just noticed that it is supposed to have 5mm convex curvature on the sides. I see that bulkheads 1, 2, possibly the transom, but not 4, also have varying degrees of curvature.

Why do you think Matt specified that?

Looks, a little more space in the side lockers, more efficient form through the water when healed, strength and rigidity through creating a slight compound curve or what?

In other words how important do you think these convex bulkhead curves are? Would the boat look a lot more boxy without them? I suspect so, so I'm thinking it's mainly a looks thing, but I don't really know.

To solve my problem I have three options:

1. Cut all the bulkheads with straight sides and forget about convexity.
2. Buy a new piece of plywood and start again (I should be able to use the remainder to cut out a full size bulkhead 2 although it will be 18mm instead of 12mm and use the rest as cleats)?
3. Glue overlapping cleats on bulkhead 3 to gain the 5mm convex curvature (but, it seems that bulkhead 3 doesn't have side cleats).

What do you think?

Cheers,
Rob.
