The above is a photo of the masthead of my Paradox. You'll see that I had to make a small wooden channel to enclose the mashead light wire. As you've worked out, there just isn't enough room to get the sheave and the wire within the mast itself. If you look carefully, you'll see the sheathing under the mast.
