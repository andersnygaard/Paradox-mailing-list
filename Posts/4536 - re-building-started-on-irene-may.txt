Subject: Re: Building Started on Irene May

Good advice, Al, will sort of follow it! I'm one of those folk who need a half-finished hull to spur me into getting all the other bits done. I have a large (insulated!)shed as well as the garage so can do a lot of work in the shed in a controlled environment. Have already started to mark-up and cut out the ply bits so I can get the sides scarphed and glued while the weather is warm. Had a bit of a panic moment when I tried to fit Bulkhead 2 and the transom with the starboard for'd side panel, but eventually realised the butt join on bulkhead 2 has to be moved 50mm towards the centre - it's all there on your amended drg one just has to stare at the detail long enough!
Really enjoying myself, building this lovely little boat is fun!
