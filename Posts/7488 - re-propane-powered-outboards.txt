Since propane has less energy/gal(about 91K BTU) than a gallon of gas(about 116K BTS)  and I pay locally(Maine)  $3.15/gal for Propane and $3.48/gal for gas.... well doesn't seem like such a great idea it me:) Then Defender wants $1730 for a Lehr 5hp while a Tohatsu 5hp will fetch $1212 really makes me wonder about the economics. But hey based on Taxing policy YMMV:)
