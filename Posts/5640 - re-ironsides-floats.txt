Very nice, well done. I can see from your grin that you are pleased 
with it.

It is funny how people don't really believe that about the tiller, 
until they have experienced it.

I have eyes on the side of the cabin top for the fenders. It works 
ok, but you have to remove the port fenders before you can hoist sail

Is your partner as happy? Do you think the mods will make it 
practical to sleep / live with two on board?

Hoping for calm nights
