Hi , just finished building my Paradox , used marine timbers supplied by a boat builder .
Cut it with a small push saw , 100 mm diameter blade , had to move it slowly , but it was light and easy to use , on longer straight cuts I lay an aluminium straight edge at a measured distance back from the cutting line , clamped it in place , and used it as a rail to press the saw against . Got perfect straight cuts .
It can be done with a jig saw , I've tried it , it works , but boy is it real slow .
Happy building

Dear Mr. Erik,
There is no comparison between a jig saw, however good it is, to a good table saw. In this project, you have to get long straight lines that are impossible to make with a jig saw.
You should look for a sturdy table saw which will enable you to cut out of whole sheets of plywood.
Reserve the jig saw for small inlets and sharply curved parts.
Gil

I bought a table saw when I read that in Don's manual. It is possible that I used it twice.

However, If you intend to cut the cleats yourself, from rough sawn, then it could be very useful.

I understand that Matt built the original Paradox in a wood where there was no power, so obviously no power tools are *necessary* but I wore out my cheap jigsaw.

If you already have a selection of tools, I would hold off buying any new ones (unless you are looking for an excuse) until you find you need them. This, of course, excludes clamps. I managed with only 10 (including two 6ft sash clamps) but felt the need for more.
