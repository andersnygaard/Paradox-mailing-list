Subject: I am concerned that a sailor is trapped in the yacht.

Let's say the Paradox is suddenly hit by a gusty wind. I understand that keel design helps but one still has to have a discipline to keep the cabin tightly closed to avoid sinking.

I probably am missing a lot about the design but I have a hard time imagining sitting in a closed cabin anticipating the worst. Please comment to clarify my misunderstanding.
