Glen,

Sounds like you have a small flock of Hens?

I believe there is a bit of a connection to them and the Bolger Micro but I could be mistaken. I was under the impression they are no longer in production which is very sad if that is the case. Perhaps ahead of their time as they may be a more attractive design now in light of current energy realities. 

They used to have great ads in Small Boat Journal. Is Ruben still active or?
