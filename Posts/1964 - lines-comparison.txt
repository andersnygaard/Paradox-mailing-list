Subject: Lines Comparison

I've traced the lines of Paradox, LC and Bolger's Jessie Cooper. See the drawing in the Larger Paradox file. The comparison drawing might be useful when thinking about scaling. Jessie Cooper's lines look somewhat similiar to LC and Paradox. At 25 feet length, I wonder how it would sail with chine runners? I know Bolger complained about the dagger board jamming when sailing in thin water. Maybe a centerboard (off to the side of the center walkway) like one of the boats in Matts sketches for a bigger cruiser might work best. Any thoughts?
