Yup, 

the Jill Baby is mine

Thanks Jack

Your boat is Jill Baby?

I am trying not to be influenced by the "finished and can't be bettered" attitude. I believe that every design is capable of changes, if not improvements, until the process is naturally exhausted. I know that Little Jim gets modified as Al gains experience with her and I'm building those mods into my design. Trouble is my boat building/sailing expertise is nil and I don't want to end up with a boat that doesn't do the job safely. Equally I don't want to get a decent boat via the hardest possible route.

Thanks for your reply....Derek

My Paradox is stitch&glue I also added the chine logs, but I used fir, just because it made the boat rigid and made for nice fair curves, I also filleted all along the edges, My Paradox has no nails or screws, except in hardware mounting etc. To me this is strong enough and I have not felt that the boat flexed at all in the water. however this is my opinion and Im not the "Paradox" expert. Many feel that the Paradox design is finished and cannot be bettered period.
