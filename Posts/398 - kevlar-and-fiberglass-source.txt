Found this in my surfing:

www.raka.com

Epoxies, cloths and tapes, fillers and pigments. Lots more.

Now I found one more reason not to use kevlar: it's #%$@%!! expensive! 60" wide 5oz material is $25/yd. compared to $5.75 for 60" wide 6oz. fiberglass cloth. You could triple sheath your bottom and still come out 40% less if you used fiberglass compared to kevlar! Then, there's the bixial weave stuff that runs up to $45/yd.! Oh well, you only need 5 yards for a Paradox - what's another $125 or so? :->

Finally saw a price for nylon peel ply - ouch! This is stuff you smooth over your final coat of epoxy on your hull for the finest finish and then peel off when the epoxy is cured. A mere $11.75/yd. for 60" width :-(
HTH

J. Pierpont Morgan had it right: "if you have to ask, you can't afford it"!
