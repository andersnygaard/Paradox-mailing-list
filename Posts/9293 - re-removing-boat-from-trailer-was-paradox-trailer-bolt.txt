Take a look at http://www.little.jim.freeuk.com and click on "trailer"

I would be interested on how you get on, if you try these. I have wondered about something similar myself.

One possible advantage of inflatable rollers is that, with the boat on the ground, you could insert the deflated rollers underneath and then inflate them, lifting the boat off the ground.

Bearing buddies are a great invention. I have used them in the past and I never had a bearing problem but I don't use them on my Paradox trailer as the wheels never go into the water.
