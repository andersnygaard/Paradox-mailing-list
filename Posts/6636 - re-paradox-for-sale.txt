By the way .... you are asking half what the boat is worth in my opinion, she is a work of art.

Hello everyone, it's been a while since I posted as I have been very busy with my life and am moving forward by down sizing in order to prepare for a circumnavigation in the near future. My partner, who throughly enjoys sailing Zoe, thinks her Tanton 43 would be better suited to the task. So... it is with a heavy heart that I have decided to part with her (Zoe that is). I have set the price at $6000 and feel she is worth that to me. Interested parties please contact me off post or call pretty much any time at 386-658-3719.
