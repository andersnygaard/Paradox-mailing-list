Subject: Re: I am concerned that a sailor is trapped in the yacht./fabric top

Having given it a bit more thought (always a good idea!) I guess my previous idea is no good, as to stand-up you would have to lift the top so high it would be guaranteed to clobber the boom since if hinged at the forward end it would be up at about 45degrees if you were standing somewhere near the seat position.

I know!! How about a sliding hatch....   

Seriously, what about keeping it more-or less to plans, but making say a hooped fabric cover ala cowboys-n-indians. If it extended a bit forward of the front of the hatch opening, and a bit aft of the rear window/washboard, then you could probably sit and stay dry even with the ends left open. It surely wouldn't need to be very high, and if kept to the minimum you need for headroom, may even be useable while underway? I'm thinking of bendy rods permanently sleeved to the fabric, like a dome-tent, and with the ends just stuck into some sort of sockets-if these were angled away from the opening at each end it might be braced sufficiently to stay in place with just the hoops.
