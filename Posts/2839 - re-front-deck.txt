Seems like a heck of a good idea Derek. Think about using a contrasting wood as well, perhaps in a flared-out design. And compliment your wife genuinely on her idea. 

Just imagine the brownie points you will amass!

Maybe have a small strip of white "caulking" visible on either side. Wha - hoo! Sexy is good!
