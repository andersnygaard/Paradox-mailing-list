Hi,

On the drawings, you may find the sheet characteristics on page #1 and reef line details on page #9. Both are specified as 6mm or 1/4" Dacron on those drawings.
I guess that halyard diameter should be the same, but I cannot find it on the drawings.

On the other hands, the previous contributor is right to mention that the material list is specifying on item#25: 5/16" Dacron line for tiller, halyard and sheet.=C2=A0 1/4" Dacron for reef line.

Hope it helps.

Regards, Frederic.
