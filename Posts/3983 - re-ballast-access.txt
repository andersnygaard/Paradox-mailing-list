Subject: Re: Ballast access


If they are fitted with the top wooden retaining pieces through which there are 2 bolts entering a wooden block glued to the floor (towards the mid section) and another 2 bolt into the chine log, the pigs can be shifted fore and aft.  The difficulty comes in getting at the 2 bolts under the flap sticking out from the tank ballast top.

I suggest making a removable plank instead of having a flap.
