Thanks Jack
Your boat is Jill Baby?
I am trying not to be influenced by the "finished and can't be bettered" attitude. I believe that every design is capable of changes, if not improvements, until the process is naturally exhausted. I know that Little Jim gets modified as Al gains experience with her and I'm building those mods into my design. Trouble is my boat building/sailing expertise is nil and I don't want to end up with a boat that doesn't do the job safely. Equally I don't want to get a decent boat via the hardest possible route.
Thanks for your reply....Derek
