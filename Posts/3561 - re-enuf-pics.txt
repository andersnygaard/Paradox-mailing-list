Subject: Re: Enuf pics?

I haven't done it in Enuf yet, but I have in VW campers and a Land Rover. Anywhere that lorries park up (usually just off motorways and on main A routes) is good, and I've slept undisturbed on small industrial estates. In Scotland you seem to be able to pull up almost anywhere but I found that a lot of the ground was fouled. I know a few remote carparks at beauty spots in Wales and the borders that are good for overnighting, and I've wondered if you could get away with it at the 24hour food stores like Tescos by junction 2 of the M5. I would guess that the chances of a policeman seeing you are remote, and if you don't look like you intend to stop for weeks they've probably got more pressing things to do.
