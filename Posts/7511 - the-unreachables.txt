Me again.. I have written to a few boat building micro cruiser groups.. I am trying to reach Dave and Mindy Bolduc, their contact email address in the contact section of microcruising.com, being: mbolduc@triad.rr.com sends me to timewarner cable, whatever that is. I am no techguru so I don't know why this happens.
Perhaps Paradox plans are being sent everywhere other than to me (Paradox paranoia).

Oh, I wrote a silly message to the smallboat group. Part of my assault on the internet in an attempt to achieve justice and my Paradox plans.
Honestly, I don't have anything against the Enigma, I was just following my own thread (barely). 

No, come to think of it I do have something against the Enigma. Listen to that Enigma in the video of an Enigma making it's way across a lake in the Yukon. Beautiful lake, sunny day, bang, bang, bang. Crikey! that thing was loud. Well loud inside anyway. Ply against the freezing waters of the Yukon I suppose. 

Mattresses! that's what that boat needs, on the floor, on the walls, preferably dry. Soggy mattresses do have a definite dampening (of course) effect on noise and as ballast are terrifically effective, in Alska (is The Yukon in Alaska? ) they probably wouldn't promote boating.
