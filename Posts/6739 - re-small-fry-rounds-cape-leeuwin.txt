Hi Geoff,

Yes,Sven is someone I greatly admire,but have no wish to emulate!
Do you have any plans to take your Paradox further afield?
The Esperance area always looked rather interesting.
I only went there once(by road)and know little about it's practicalities,but there are a lot of islands.

Cheers
Neil
