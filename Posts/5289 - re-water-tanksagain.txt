Thanks Al,
I was hoping to make one of these tanks for drinkable water and was actually gonna split the design using one half per plan and the other with a plastic tank insert. I was thinking with the water inlet valve I could control it so no rainwater would enter drinking tank. Add a valve to water outlet and I could control which tank to use. Desalinator for fresh water refill on long voyages or filter water from rain side to go into fresh tank.... all this sure sounds like a lot of work after I just spelled it out for you. Prob best to stick with plans and carry drinking water jug with a portable watermaker onboard for long hauls. Hehe.... sometime I think I luv gadgets too much.

It all depends on what your sailing is going to be like, but I have a few observations.

I launch and recover every trip, and want the tanks empty while towing. I quickly found that lots of the launch sites don't have water on tap so ended up filling with sea water. Bang goes the idea of ever drinking from these tanks.

Even when only filled with tap water, after a few months an interesting layer of slime appeared on the inside of the tanks. Presumably your plastic tank or bladder would suffer the same fate.

If you want to have an emergency reserve of drinking water fill some bottles (I use 2 litre fizzy drinks bottles) and put them in the tank before filling with ballast water. Fish them out if they are required and top up the tank with sea water. The bottles can easily be cleaned or replaced if they get a bit nasty inside. And they are free!

Hoping for calm nights
