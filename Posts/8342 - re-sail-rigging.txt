Hi,

I had the same experience with the new design sail. My cure was to add a doubled pulley to the yard, so I had more accurate control over the yard. I moved the yard attachment point a few inches back, that relieved some pressure on the front of the sail allowing me to reef it as per the design. I moved the sail inches forward then inches back testing the best place for it, so it would actually furl.

The extra blocks, or pulleys on the yard help tighten the sail and then it clears the hatch nicely. It took a few days of messing about to get it right. Now it's fine. Don't be discouraged it will work with adjustment.
