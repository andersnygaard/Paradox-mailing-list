Steve, that was my thoughts too when I first saw it in a yachting mag. I have the test report and some of the photos could be mistaken for a Paradox if it weren't for the obvious scale difference with people in the shot. Furled sails did a podcast interview about this boat here http://www.furledsails.com/article.php3?article=3D771
