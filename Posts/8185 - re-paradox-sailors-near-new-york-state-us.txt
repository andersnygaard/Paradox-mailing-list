Brian,

Have you considered the designs of Jim Michalak? His small Birdwatcher style boats make great camping boats. IMB or Philsboat work well in that regard. I built a Philsboat. Much simpler than Paradox, about 200 hours labour in total. The only reason I'm now building a Paradox is I wanted something that I could go offshore in and being honest, I just felt like building another boat.

At the end of the day you've got out on the water with what you've built and really... that's what matters.

Cheers,

Rob.
