Subject: Re: Side Motor Mount

I've seen Al Law's side mounted electric motor in action and it works very well. I've gone for petrol (2.3 Honda) because I don't want to be tied to recharging. It is mounted on the transom. I have extend the throttle with a pvc pipe and the kill switch with a cord. I found that the starting cord was easy to reach but I have a removable rear window. At one point I thought that the window had gone overboard. You wouldn't think it possible to lose a window on a craft as small as a Paradox, would you?
The motor seems to do about 7 miles per litre at 4 mph. I have a litre of petrol in the motor's tank and another 4 litres in Trangia fuel bottles that are in a bucket behind bulkhead four. I'm not happy with keeping petrol in the boat at all.  It is much too near the cooking gear although I cook down near bulkhead two with as much ventilation as possible. Over the winter I intend to look at mounting an external tank and feeding the motor's integral tank with a bulb and pipe. I think the Bolduc's do something like this. I think that the Honda throttle control could be brought into the bought by a Bowden cable.

Off sailing tomorrow :0)
