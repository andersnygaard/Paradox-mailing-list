The pivot on my boat is seated into epoxy. I drilled a hole in the yuloh a few mm wider than the ball, then filled that with thickened epoxy. The socket was then drilled in the epoxy the same size as the ball.

This allows you to easily play with the depth of the hole as, if you decide you have made it too deep, you can simply fill it with epoxy again. The socket eventually wears and needs to be refurbished every 4 or 5 years.

The design already calls for the pin to be offset.
