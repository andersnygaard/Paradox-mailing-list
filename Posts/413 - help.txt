Hi All,

Just spent all day measuring. It looks like everything is to spec except for the sides. They are not 12 mm ply. Looks like some kind of 6 mm stuff including the glass (I drilled a hole and took a measurement). How much is this going to compromise the integrity of the hull? Can anything be done about it? HELP!!

Thanks,
David
