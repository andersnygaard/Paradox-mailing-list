I agree with others about changing the cam cleat angle for the lines that come into the cabin.

Having to shift forward to lock the lines in the cam cleats was uncomfortable. Sometime I would pull on the line with both hands on and used my foot to press the line down into the cleat. Very silly.

With the new block and angle change I am betting it will easier to manage locking the lines.
