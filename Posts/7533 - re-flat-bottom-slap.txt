Does the flat bottom of the Paradox result in the sole slapping when at anchor? A member of the microcruiser group presumes a V bowed boat would prevent this happening. 

Not in my experience. When properly trimmed the stem is an inch or so below the waterline. This, presumably, is enough to keep the air out. On a few occasions when I have anchored by the stern then slapping has occurred. With the transom just kissing the water, small waves can create a gap that lets the air in.

The only time I have had disturbing slapping was when being towed (though travelling under motor presumably is the same). I found that leaning over the side, causing the boat to heel, stopped it.
