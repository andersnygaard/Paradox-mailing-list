The Scilly Isles are on my list of must-go places, when I can order my life sufficiently to take the time off. 

I'm hoping to have 'Faith' on the water by mid summer 2007, perhaps before. Maybe we could have a shot at the Scillies together? I've been there a good many times in various boats and in my opinion they beat the French Biscay Islands in beauty and interest. Fantastic cruising area.

That sounds like a good plan.

It's in response to Pete's question, Why Build Paradox.

Ahh yes, that trip was last April, but I don't remember you being onboard, and you got it wrong about the bacon and eggs. I have given up frying onboard, the washing up afterwards is too much trouble.

Hoping for calm nights
