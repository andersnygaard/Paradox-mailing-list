Subject: Re: Hello :o) In new here.

Choosing a design based on criteria rather than modifying an existing 
design is good general-purpose advice, but raises a question: ARE 
there in fact any designs similar to Matt's?  I would like to be able 
to cruise two.  I, also, if I build a Paradox, will need a little 
motor of some sort: I have responsibilities, limited spans of time, 
and schedules to keep. Can anyone name me a design that offers 
anything remotely resembling Paradox's combination of sail-from-
inside, self-righting, and shoal draft cruising in a small package?  
I know of designs that can do several of these things, but none that 
offers all.  Jim Michalak's new design, Caroline, is often discussed, 
but I don't think it's in Paradox's class in terms of seaworthiness 
and handiness in windy conditions.
