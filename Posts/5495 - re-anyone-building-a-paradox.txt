Hi Al. You will find the lowered floor makes a lot of difference for access and comfort to
the "stateroom" as I have already designed that idea into NOLI. I have just added a photo 
in my NOLI folder showing this. When I was doing a bit of work in this area I felt it was 
quite comfortable in there lying on my side, and that I could have quite happily gone to
sleep with my feet sticking out into the main cabin area. I also have a Brompton folding
bike, but I have the exteneded seat post on mine and its just too tall to go through the
opening. But I'm working on it.
   
Yes, the step as drawn used to dig into my side when reaching forward and the dividers
used to make the space quite restricted. I think that opening it up will make access 
easier though with the dividers more stuff can probably be packed in. (How you get at it
then becomes the problem.) As I have a lot of unused storage space that shouldn't be a
problem.
 
When I bought the bike, second hand, it also had the extended seat post, but I didn't
need it. Then this summer I found someone who had a short post and didn't mind having
the long one, so we did a swap. Which is why I suddenly decided to make the mods. With
the short post it is almost a perfect fit.

Hoping for calm nights

Al,
Yeovil, England.
