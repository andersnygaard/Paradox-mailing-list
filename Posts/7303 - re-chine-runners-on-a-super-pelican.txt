Subject: Re: CHINE RUNNERS ON A SUPER PELICAN

I added some photos filed under "Grear Pelican".

In 1980 I built a 16 foot great pelican. I didn't like the centerboard idea either. I made one single leeboard and mounted it on the starboard side. Angled a little bit inward at the bottom. It worked great. On both tacks it worked just fine. I made lite cardboard patterns of various shapes for the leaboard, laid them over the drawings with the centerboard drawn in at various depths of loweredness. I glued together two layers of 1/2 inch plywood for it's construction, and fiberglassed it. I'll try to dig out some photos if you like this idea.

HI ALL  (AGAIN) - 

LET ME START AT THE BEGINNING.... I AM WORKING ON THE REDESIGN OF THE SAN FRANCISCO PELICAN - THE 18' SUPER PELICAN MODEL.   I'VE GOT EVERYTHING IN PLACE (AT LEAST I BELIEVE THERE IN PLACE).           
NOW HERE'S  MY PROPLEM.   I WANT TO ADD "CHINE-RUNNERS AND GET RID OF THAT TREMENDOUS CENTERBOOARD.  ICAN DRAW IT UP OK BUT I NEED SOME INPUT FROM "PARADOX" BUILDER AS TO ITS PHASABILATIES.  NOW THAT YOU'VE BUILT YOUR BOATS DO YOU THINK THE CHINE-RUNNERS CAN BE TRANSFERED TO ANOTHER DESIGN.  IF I LAY THE PELICAN DRAWING OVER THE PARADOX DRAWING THEY JUST ABOUT MATCH (CHINES).
I WOULD APPRECIATE ANY INPUT (GOOD OR BAD) ABOUT WHAT I'M TRYING.

THANKS ALL - ALOHA - JACK SPOERING- ocala, fl
