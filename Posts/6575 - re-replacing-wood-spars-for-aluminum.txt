I too think that you will have problems as you do not appear to have 
a complete universal joint at the deck. In photo PIC01170.JPG there 
does not appear to be any freedom for the boom to move fore and aft, 
something it will try to do.

I also have some doubts that the castor wheel frame will be man 
enough to take the tensile load, it was designed for compressive 
loads, after all.
 
Considering that you have copied so much from Paradox I wonder why 
you did not go with the utter simplicity, reliability and 
repairability of a piece of string at this joint.

Hoping for calm nights
