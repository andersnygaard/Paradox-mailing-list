Subject: Re: Sven's book, concluded
 
Kjell,
I don't think the idea EVER was to put Sven's book in cyberspace.  I don't think anyone proposed that.

The idea that I discussed was getting Sven's book completely translated into English and then asking my publisher to issue an English edition.

Perhaps I missed the "memo" .  : )
