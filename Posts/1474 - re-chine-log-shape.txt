Subject: Re: Chine Log shape

I think I finally realize rather than cut a rolling bevel into the side of the chine log, its easier to glue it down flat to the side, and cut the rolling bevel on the bottom, which happens to be easy there cause its straight across. Which I think is what everyone is telling me.

Thanks,
Paul
