Subject: Re: Crushed Walnut Shells

I've been using walnut shells for years on my projects. They can be bought at any sand blasting supply house for less than $15 for a fifty pound bag. If your lucky, and someone broke a bag ask if you can sweep them up and have them. I usually use epoxy to set them in and then Vacuum into a clean shop vac for use on the next project. Another coat of epoxy locks them in place. Once painted take an orbital sander and sand off the sharp edges, you will have a nonskid that is very comfortable on your hands, feet, and bottom but when the nonskid gets wet the wood will rise up out of the paint in the bare areas and give you even more grip. A look in Zoe's folder will give you a view of the finished product. Have fun!
