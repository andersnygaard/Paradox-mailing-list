Thanks Bill,

I guess the going is getting tough!! My back hurts in places I didn't know it could. My fingers feel like fat sausages, all my arms and thighs are sore as hell and my eggs taste like epoxy!! HELL YES, I am having fun!!! But need the COFFEE. LOL

I am glad you and others were here first as there have been alot of nice improvements made to this design by you guys.
