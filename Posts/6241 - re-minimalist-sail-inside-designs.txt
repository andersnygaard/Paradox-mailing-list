I really like the idea of this topper design!

Going along with Cathy's idea of making it removable so one could
car-top the partially decked over hull and then installing the topper at
the launch site. Have  rubber type compressible seals around the bottom
edges of the topper frame snugged down with nylon wing nuts.

The roll-back canvas enclosure would have vinyl windows installed to
allow viewing foreward and upwards when sailing inside.

When day sailing in nice weather one could leave the topper behind.

This could be adapted to almost any hull you choose. Have a folding
dolly to get down to the water if necessary.

Would work best in a small van with the extra strorage space inside.
