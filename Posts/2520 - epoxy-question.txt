Subject: epoxy question

This is a question mostly for the us folks:

Does anyone have experience with uscomposites epoxy (and fiberglass)? It seems like they have competitive prices (around $27/gallon for a 5gal kit). Also, the cloth looks reasonable too (although it's comparable with other places like Noah).
