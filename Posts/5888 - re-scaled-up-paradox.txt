One guy was building Paradox by butting the side panels rather than scarfing them. This makes the boat about 8 inches longer with all the extra length in the middle where it is most needed. I do not know how or if he progressing. If I were building Paradox (as I almost=C2=A0did till my life took an unexpected turn) I would make some changes in the main part of the cabin to make more space, longer and wider. The Enigma 4.6 is closer I think to where I'd finish up if I had carried on.

At 6'2", I've inquired about the larger Paradox, too, but the idea of 
a displacement of over a ton fair takes my breath away. It's certain 
my minivan couldn't tow it! I'd much rather knock down the forward 
bulkhead and find a way to raise the cabin top on the stock design a 
few inches.
