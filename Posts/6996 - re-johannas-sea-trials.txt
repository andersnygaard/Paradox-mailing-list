As you say, weather permitting.

The format tends to be that we turn up at Shipstal point late 
afternoon onwards, then stand around chatting a lot.

The HW figures are probably for Portsmouth (the default location for 
S coast tides). If the 1.0m LW at 1448h is correct then HW will be 
about 1.8m anywhere between 0600h and 1130h (double high water with 
little dip between).

I went to get a copy of September's sailing today but apparently it 
is now October :-(  This is presumably our publicity officer doing 
his stuff (Oops, note to self - I am supposed to be writing an 
article for him).
