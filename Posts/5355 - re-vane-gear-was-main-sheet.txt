Subject: Re: Vane Gear was: Main sheet

I made a model this weekend and the penny finally dropped for me. But as they say 'the devil is in the details' and I do have a few questions in that regard if you get a moment.

1. Do you leave the rudder tiller to swing completely free?
2. Does your pendulum swing out if not secured?
3. Does the securing line around the pendulum shaft cause much friction? Can the oar turn easily and would you suggest installing a bearing at this location?
4. Where do you secure the vane setting lines? Can this be done from the cockpit? And do you feel safe leaning out and tightening the black securing knob in a seaway?

Many thanks in advance.
