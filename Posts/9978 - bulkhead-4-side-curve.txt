Subject: Bulkhead #4 (side curve)
Date: Wed, 15 Mar 2023 21:04:40 -0700

After my first full week of building I have the 6 laminated beams completed and bulkheads 1,2,3 cutout bulkhead #4 shows no side curve (5 or 7mm on others) does #4 have curve? I searched the database but can't find anything on #4.

Also the curve from top of bulkhead to midpoint of cutout I am assuming is your own interpretation? Like I did on #3 I used 140mm circle for bottoms of cutout.

Thanks
Erik
