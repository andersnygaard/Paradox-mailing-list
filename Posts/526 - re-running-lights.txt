International maritime law requires all vessels under 17 ft to be able to show a white light in time to avoid a collision, this could be a flash light. Paradox uses an all around white light or anchor light, if you will, to satisfy the requirement. Another advantage which is not at first apparent unless you are familiar with the right of way rules is that all vessels overtaking another are burdened and must give way to the vessel being overtaken. Now if you think about it for a second you will realize that when a vessel sees your anchor/running light out there on the horizon they will think they are looking at the stern light of another vessel and as they get closer they will (hopefully) alter course to avoid you. It should be noted that inland right of way rules do not satisfy international right of way rules but international laws satisfy inland rules.

In your case, David, where you are operating on a river you might want to have port and starboard lights as well if for no other reason than the yahoos out there at night running around in high speed craft probably haven't got a clue as to the right of way rules.
