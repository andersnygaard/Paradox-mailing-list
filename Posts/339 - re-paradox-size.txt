Dan, I have for a few months now been working on drawings for a 'stretched PARADOX'. The hull is a new design with a flatter run for'n'aft but everything else is the same as PARADOX, rig, rudder etc. The oal is 16' with a 4'-4" beam and a draught of 9". The bottom panel beam is 4', chine runners added to the sides flush with the bottom. Although this is a larger boat, 12" longer than LITTLE CRUISER, by tweeking the lines in the PLYBOATS design program I have got the displacement down to 1507 pounds. PARADOX is 1410lbs, LITTLE CRUISER 1650lbs.
The main living space is 6'-6" long by 3' wide with 3'-2" under the hatch. Dan, sit on the floor and get someone to measure from the floor to the top of your head. The coach roof is slightly longer. I am designing this new boat (PARAMOUR) for stitch and glue construction. The hull will be of slightly lighter construction. The sides will be 3/8" and the bottom 3/4" with one layer of Kevlar and two of woven rovings.
For the nerds out there. PARAMOUR's prismatic coefficient is .566 while PARADOX is .580. Using the same sail area PARAMOUR will be faster and just as stiff, if not stiffer and point a tad higher. We are lucky so far in the UK in not having the 14' rule you have in the US. Without it, Matt would have I am shure made PARADOX 16'.
There is nothing wrong with PARADOX, it's just that I enjoy designing and building boats. I think Matt is an extraordinarily capable designer, I just wish he would put pen to paper and start writing about his voyages. Modest chap that he is.

Jeff,

I am interested in your stretched 16' redesign. When do you think you will be finished, and can I get(buy) the finished version?
