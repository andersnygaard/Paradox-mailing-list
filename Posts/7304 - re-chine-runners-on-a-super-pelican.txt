Go ahead and do it, you can remove them later if they don't work. Jump in, do it!

HI ALL (AGAIN) -

LET ME START AT THE BEGINNING.... I AM WORKING ON THE REDESIGN OF THE SAN FRANCISCO PELICAN - THE 18' SUPER PELICAN MODEL. I'VE GOT EVERYTHING IN PLACE (AT LEAST I BELIEVE THERE IN PLACE).
NOW HERE'S MY PROPLEM. I WANT TO ADD "CHINE-RUNNERS AND GET RID OF THAT TREMENDOUS CENTERBOOARD. ICAN DRAW IT UP OK BUT I NEED SOME INPUT FROM "PARADOX" BUILDER AS TO ITS PHASABILATIES. NOW THAT YOU'VE BUILT YOUR BOATS DO YOU THINK THE CHINE-RUNNERS CAN BE TRANSFERED TO ANOTHER DESIGN. IF I LAY THE PELICAN DRAWING OVER THE PARADOX DRAWING THEY JUST ABOUT MATCH (CHINES).
I WOULD APPRECIATE ANY INPUT (GOOD OR BAD) ABOUT WHAT I'M TRYING.

THANKS ALL - ALOHA - JACK SPOERING- ocala, fl
