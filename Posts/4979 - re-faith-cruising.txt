Bill,

Thanks for your posting. I am following your blog and attempting to track your progress on Google earth. It is great fun to follow you (while staying warm and dry). I am sitting here a couple hundred yards from San Francisco Bay with my West Wight Potter in the garage saying, "I could do something like that". Very risky train of thought - Who knows,I might just try it!

Thanks again for your reports,

Pat
