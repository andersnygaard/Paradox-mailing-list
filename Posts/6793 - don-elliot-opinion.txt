Subject: Don Elliot opinion

Hello,

I purchased Don Elliot's guide on the Paradox and found it very informative. However, I was unable to access any information on his Paradox site. I just sent off my money order for the Paradox but I am curious about any other ideas that Don Elliot had.

Cheers,
Mark
