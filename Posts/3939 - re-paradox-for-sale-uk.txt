Mr. Clark, sorry to hear your sugars have been going low. Being a diabetic myself I know how frustrating it can be. Now my glucose numbers are not the greatest and argue with the Dr.s that they are are trying to keep my numbers to low for the active life style I have (when i'm not sitting behind the desk all week). The safty margin at 100 is just not that great. So I try to keep myself at 150 for the extra safty margin while sailing and doing other activities. Anyway I hate to see you give up somthing you love so much. Look at the good side, all this activity allows us to eat more!

I would love to buy your boat, but shipping to Jacksonville, FL may be to much.
Also want to thank you for the Duckworks article too.

Regards,

Niels
