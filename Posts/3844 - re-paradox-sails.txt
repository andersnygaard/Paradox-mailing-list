It is designed with the clew end larger diameter than the tack end. Actually, it is rectangular with 8mm radius corners. 50mm x 38mm at the clew, 35mm x 38mm at the tack. A difference in circumference of 30mm.

It is not a problem that it moves forward, just something that happens. If you allow for it then it is ok, if you try to fight it then you are storing up trouble.
