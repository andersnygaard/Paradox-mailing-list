At the rear cabin bulkhead (bulkhead 4) this is 88mm (3.5"). At the next bulkhead forward (bulkhead 3) it is 140mm (5.5"). The distance between the two bulkheads is 932mm (36.5")

The middle of the handle is about 700mm (28") above the sole, about 900mm (35") forward from bulkhead 4. 

The seat, as drawn is about 400mm (16") above the sole.

It is never *necessary* to sit down inside on the sole, it is merely more comfortable when the weather turns nasty. If you stay on the seat you are still better protected than someone in a conventional dinghy.
