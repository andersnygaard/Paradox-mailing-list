That sort of thing appeals to me too. I think that the original Paradox would be just too cramped for me.

If I could have a rub at Alladin's lamp I'd go for a stretched Paradox type hull with conventional rig (main and staysail) 

The question is, could the Paradox type chine runners resist the increased windage and drive from the slightly taller rig. And would stretching the hull dimensions greatly increase the difficulties of launching, recovery onto the trailer and towing load?
