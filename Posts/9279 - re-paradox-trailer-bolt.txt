I solved the pile-of-rope problem by using a single rope for both the halyard and the reefing. One end is attached to the yard, it goes up the mast then down and into the cabin, there is a loop of a couple of metres then it goes back into the vent box and up to the furling drum. As you haul in one end you pay out the other, there is never more than a couple of metres lying loose on the floor.

Watch out for wear on the line holding the tack strut down. I used to have to change this a couple of times a year until I found a bit of plastic tube to slip over the line where it comes through the deck.
