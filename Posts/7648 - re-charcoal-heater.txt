Subject: Re: Charcoal Heater

Your description of my heater is about right.- made from 2 inch dia copper tube with ends brazed on and about 6 inches high. The flexible flue pipe is getting a bit rusty now, but it's only surface rust and will last a bit longer yet. I also use a chimney extension -which is made from a bit of old vacuum cleaner tube which I found at the dump. If you face the bent part on the top of the extension facing downwind, it improves the draught with its suction.

It will burn charcoal or tiny scraps of wood-if that's what you have.

If I was going to do it again, I'd make it a bit bigger to get more heat.
