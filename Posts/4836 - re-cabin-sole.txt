Hi 

Hoping for calm nights, 

hasn't the weather been aweful here in UK, have you been out yet Al, 

Paradox seems the ideal boat for winter sailing, well apart from a 
Hunter ranger, Nauticat or Island packet! 

But at least paradox sailing can be said to be standing in the shower 
with a hard top over you, trying to tear up 1p coins!

Plan to get my bottom ply today for my car topping enigma style 
paradox. 

Yours James
