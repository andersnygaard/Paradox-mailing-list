Subject: Re: Robust constuction

I agree DC, Whisper was built using 1/4 ply for he sides instead of 1/2, so I added another layer of 1/4 ply to bring her up to spec. So now her sides are a sandwich of 1/4 ply 6 oz glass and epoxy, another layer of 1/4 ply glass and epoxy, should be strong

As a first time builder I like to ask a lot questions, I hate doing something when I don't know why I'm doing it. Hope you Guys don't mind ?
