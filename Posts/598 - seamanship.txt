Hi All,

I would like to start a discussion on handling a Paradox in bad weather. As I sail Whisper I have been trying to figure out her weak points, the first one that that came to mind is the rudder. It's big enough to take a beating by the waves. Let's say your having to ride a storm out using a parachute anchor, what would be the best position for the rudder? rudder pulled up and to one side all the way? to give the waves less area to pound on. Any comments or suggestions? I know that you should do your homework and not get caught in these conditions, but you need to be ready if you do.
