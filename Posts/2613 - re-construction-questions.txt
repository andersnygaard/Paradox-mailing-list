My deck fittings are all through bolted, so I need access to the underside of the fore deck. If there is no hole in the bulkhead then the spars can not be stored inside.

My experience of 'watertight' compartments is that they fill up with water which cannot get out (because they are watertight). If you want sealed buoyancy I would recommend fitting a hatch in the bulkhead which can be opened for spar storage and inspection and closed while underway.

I also considered an anchor well. The downsides are that a lot of weight forward is undesirable (I use the space to store my bedding) and that in anything except a flat calm I would not want to be out on the bow (all my anchoring is done from the hatch).

I have been a lurker on this group for some while now - and have recently built a 1:5 model of PARADOX.

Two questions on building the real thing. Sheet 3 indicates that bulkhead 1 is watertight, yet sheet 7 gives various options for openings in it ? What are the groups opinions on sealing this bulkhead and filling the whole of the section forward of it with foam ?

Has anybody considered forming a small anchor well (much like those that John Welsford uses on his boats), self draining and open to the deck, above this forward compartment ?

I would be most interested in the pros and cons of these two ideas. I put them forward with some trepidation as it very hard to find fault with such a well thought out piece of design as the PARADOX
