Hi Pete,

Is that Far Eastern Ply you're using on your Paradox/Enigma design on the microcruiser site? Looks like it will turn out to be a super boat.

Do you build entirely outside (as shown in your pics)? I'm a bit strapped for space here. I have a car port which I intend to completely enclose which will give me a dry, if not warm area to work. I can just about squeeze a Paradox in the garage, but that means clearing it of 20 years of accumulated junk first!

One thing that worries me slightly is dust. My neighbours both sides spend every waking hour polishing and tending to their cars. I'm not going to be very popular if they wake up every day to find an inch of epoxy dust on their bonnets! Is dust a problem when it comes to rubbing down and finishing time?

Best regards,

Randoneur
