Subject: Re: Translating Sven's Book: Group Project?

This is a good plan. There are ten chapters total, and Kjell has already translated one, so that leaves 9 to go. If have three people who are willing to translate three chapters each we could be close to ready to go! I would be willing to photocopy my book and send it to the translators.

We just had another application for membership from a fellow from Sweden. Perhaps we should make it a condition that all newbies with a .se at the end of their email addresss should have to promise to do some translating to get a full membership;-)

I am wondering how many members from the land of the Vikings found out about Paradox through Sven's writings?

Could we have a show of hands?
