I aim to start cutting for the cabin shortly.
I have a lot of 12mm ply and intend to make the sides and front of the cabin from this and rout out the window shapes to flush fit the Lexan on a bed of silicon. The rear of the cabin will have a lift out window so that I can reach the outboard with the cabin top closed.

I have been loking at Bolger and Michalak designs and like the slot top that they often use. The advantages seem to me to be: easy access to the mast and bow of the boat and more space to stand up in. A disadvantage may be that a Paradox on its side may not float with the slot out of the water.

I intend to use Enuf on rivers, estuaries and short sea trips from estuary to estuary. I am trying to think of a way of sealing a slot top on a Paradox. My thoughts at the moment are centering around the plasticised fabric that is used for soft sided lorry trailers. I have just skinned a kayak with it and it is very strong.

Has anybody any thoughts or comments on this idea?
