I'm sorry if that is the way it came over, it certainly wasn't meant that way. 

Everyone who builds includes their own 'improvements' into the boat. Jeff, on the Isle of Wight, is building an S&amp;G version which I shall be very interested in comparing to mine. If you want to build in steel please do, and let us know how it goes. However, this idea of building in steel has come up 3 times now (once may have been in another forum) and so far no one has actually done it. Is this another of those times? 

I shall be delighted if you do produce a successful steel paradox as the more examples there are of this fine craft, the better. So, do you intend to excite us or disappoint us?
