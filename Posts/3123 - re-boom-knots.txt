Subject: Re: Boom Knots

All I can say Derek is,

Please build a new one!

when that boom fails...... it will most likely be when the wind gets almost too much to handle and time to reef in and head home. When it does snap, and by the looks of that knot it will break in 2 pieces. think of it like this, whats the sail worth?  Im sure where ever you go in this boat locals will follow it, I have a "cheering section" where I sail. On the first launch day, I had a wind that was pushing me back into the muddy cove, 4 failed attempts at tacking my way out I look over to the row of lawn chairs and they are all looking pointing and laughing at me. So I lift the rudder to get a bit more bite, relax a little and let a bit of the sheet loose and just let the boat do her thing, 4 more tacks and Im out in clean wind and looking good. When I arrived back at the ramp, I guess the senior of the old salts comes over while im securing the boat and says, We didnt think you were going to make it there for a while, good show!!! wheres your centerboard??  I explain the Paradox's concept and they are amazed. I then inform them that its the first time in my life I have sailed. ever since these guys have kept an eye on my truck and trailer and keep an eye out for us. If and when that boom fails, how would you explain it to your fans when you return to the dock? if you return to that dock? Have a wonderful day with your son and be there at his 22nd!!!

Broken boom becomes a bat swinging in the wind, or whatever you guys call that cricket thing.
