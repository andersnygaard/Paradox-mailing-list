Ah, but you don't need to sit on the cabin sole for a long period of wet weather do you Al? Just put up the brolly over your head.

I like that one. Read somewhere that an umbrella and a hat stand were the most useless things on a small boat. Now just need to find a use for the hat stand.

If it has nice curly hooks on top it might double as a boat hook, or an emergency anchor?

Or you could hang hats on it?
