Hi Jake,

I don't have any numbers, But there is FAQ in the Paradox file that addresses this question. I have seen a Paradox sail with Seapearls and point as high as they did. There is an article in SCA worth reading for anybody with questions about her pointing ability. The chine runners work !! Hope this has helped.
