Subject: Re: Calling all Paradox skippers: assessments?

Andrew, go to files and click on "Larger Paradox."  This is a straightforward scale-up.  It tempts me because I am 6'2" and not especially limber.  Downside is this thing would be HEAVY.  So far I'm just an observer, but I think I'd cut down the forward bulkhead opening and reduce the side bins to increase the sleeping space, and maybe raise the house a smidgen,  before I'd suffer the enormous increase in weight required to keep her self-righting and get the hull deep enough for the chine runners to bite.

I would like to know what is the stretched version of Paradox? and where can I find out more about it and maybe see some design sketches and specs?
