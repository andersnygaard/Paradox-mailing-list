Subject: Swivel Rod & Tack Strop Pipe

Today ended up being more productive than expected.

Late last weekend I ordered a foot of 1/4" standard 40 brass (C230) pipe from https://www.onlinemetals.com/merchant.cfm?step=3D2&amp;id=3D85. Cool website. It arrived by this weekend, and instead of planning my day around the Superbowl; I decided to piddle with the reefing system.

I cut & split both the marine brass rod and the brass pipe with a hacksaw; the blade had 32 teeth per inch. This went smooth.

The brass pipe was easier to work with than the marine brass rod. It was easy to bend the brass pipe with little strategy. For the marine brass rod, I ended up using a pipe flairing tool to open the Y-bend; after it was opened enough, it became easier to manipulate.

I beat the pipe with a hammer to flatten it out; no problems. I tried this same technique with the rod, but since the rod is thicker, and the Y smaller; there wasn't enough room to work with it (at least for my tools, and my skillset).

While at the hardware store shopping for a 1/4" stainless steel bolt, I stumbled upon a clevis pin, which I liked better than the bolt. I'm using a key ring to keep the clevis pin from slipping away from the to Ys.

I'm pleased with this arrangement, and am very impressed with Matt Layden's design. Looking forward to learning whether the materials I chose will prove up to the challenge.

Some photos are in my folder.
