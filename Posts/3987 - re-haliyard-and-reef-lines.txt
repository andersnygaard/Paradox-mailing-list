Subject: Re: Haliyard and Reef lines

I am not sure what you achieve by that. Matt needs to keep a high tension on both lines because he does not use a topping lift (which may well be a good decision as the toping lift does have it's down side). He obviously gets sufficient drag, presumably by bending the line over the lip where it exits the vent trunk, or he would have fitted something else. even with your device you would need to use your foot as the load on on the other line need 2 hands (unless you are a lot stronger than me)

When I was building I too thought up lots of improvements to the plans, but decided to build as the plans stated, knowing I could modify it later if I wanted. I am glad I did as nearly all my 'improvements' stemmed from a lack of understanding of how the system worked. The only two changes I can bring to mind which are successful (apart from the topping lift) are the window in the hatch and splitting the lids of the underfloor lockers so they can be opened with the seat down. I am still unsure whether I shall keep the water ballast.
