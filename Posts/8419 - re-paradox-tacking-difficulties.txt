Dave,

Thanks for your interesting comparison between Matt's different designs, and for posting your clever vang attachment method.

I'm still curious how Little Cruiser's bow centerboard affected her sailing characteristics, as I've never sailed with a bow centerboard? Do you think a bow centerboard makes tacking more difficult than a more centrally-located centerboard would? When reaching do you have an increased weather helm? And when sailing downwind do you lift the bow centerboard to reduce the change of broaching?
