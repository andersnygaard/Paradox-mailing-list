Hi Derek,

That really doesn't sound right at all for a canoe. Well, unless it's about six feet long and about 9 inches wide.

Displacement should mean the complete weight that it can support in the water at the design waterline. That includes the weight of the boat as well as anything one would chose to put in it.
