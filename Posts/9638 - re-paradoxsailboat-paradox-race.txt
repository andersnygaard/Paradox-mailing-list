Hi Rick,

I developed an allergy to wood-dust.
So I bought a powered respirator like this:

Now I breath clean air and build small boats.

Hi Rick,

Concerning the “any body of water rule”, I think things can get complicated, when one considers prevailing winds and currents. For example, I have paddled around Manhattan Island (28 miles) a number of times. This involves three rivers, the Hudson, the East and the Harlem. If a paddler starts at the right time he can circumnavigate the island with a favorable current for the entire trip. And when he completes the first round trip he can continue for another loop with the same conditions. Furthermore some of these currents exceed 6 knots.

So if a competitor finds a body of water with similar conditions or, for that matter, comes to New York to do his race, he would have what seems like an unfair advantage compared, for example, to a sailor on a lake. Prevailing winds poses a similar situation. And what if a competitor finds a nice wide bay with a strong breeze and decides to beam reach back and forth for 24 hours?

Developing rules for any race is complicated, but for a race such as this, where any body of water can be used, seems to limit the “level playing field” concept.

Anyhow, it looks like it’ll be a hoot. Wish I could give it a go!
