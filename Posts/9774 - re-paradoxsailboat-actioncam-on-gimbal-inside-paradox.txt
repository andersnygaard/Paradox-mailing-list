I see the seat being used , my seat only gets used when I’m close to port . Otherwise I sit on a child size bean bag , on the lower side of the hull . I’m short so it’s easy to sit almost across the cabin . It’s more comfortable and stops “ bot rot” from a hard seat .
I’ve made my seat with upholstery straps across it and that’s made it more comfortable .
Though as I said , it gets minimal use 
I double bagged the beans in the bean bag too , they would make a mess if the bag ripped open . So the foam beads are in a bag in a bag and I watch the stitching .
Hope someone is out sailing a paradox right now
