Subject: SARCA combination anchors

Has anybody tried out these Australian made "SARCA" anchors ? They look as if they would work in a number of different situations.

I guess if I were outfitting my own Paradox now, I would probably just get a Danforth style anchor along with some sort of plow anchor for trickier bottoms.  Then, I would attach about 10 to 14 feet of 3/16" - 1/4" galvanized chain along with 100 feet of 3/8" dacron line to each one, and I would be good to go.

Dave,  I am interested in why you would use Dacron instead of Nylon line ?
