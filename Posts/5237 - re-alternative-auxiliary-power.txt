I made it work the other way for me. Because I decided to have no 
motor to fall back on I was forced to learn to use the sails and the 
yuloh properly. Bill commented to me that, although he had experience 
of many sailboats, with the Paradox he had a steep learning curve. I 
noticed that whenever he got into a position where he was hard on the 
wind, tacking into a bay or some such, he would start the engine. 
This meant that he had no chance to learn to sail better.

Nothing wrong with that, of course, but if you do want to learn to 
sail and scull then leave the motor at home. There is nothing like 
being a couple of miles from home, on a falling tide and a fading 
wind for teaching you how to get the best from your boat. And it is 
*incredibly* satisfying when you do get home.
