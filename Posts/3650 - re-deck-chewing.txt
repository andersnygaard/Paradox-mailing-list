Thank you Al. I like the idea of a disk or washer. I'm in the process of studying the plans. Another thing. The mainsheet is presented to the helmsman at his back, and this seems awkward. I had visualized running it forward a bit say two or three feet,along the starboard side near the tiller rope. And then round a block and running aft a bit and then to it's cleat or camcleat. As this way it would be in the front of the helmsman. Is it annoying at all where it is, as shown on the plans ? Thank you again, 

No, it is easy and natural to operate. You pull in the sheet by thrusting forward with your arm while bracing your back against bulkhead 4. The slack then, in my boat, falls into a bin behind bulkhead 4 where it cannot get tangled up round your feet. Very neat. Remember, it is not like a dinghy where you have to play the sheet the whole time, set the sail and lock it off then don't touch it again unless the wind or course changes. Boring really, take a good book. :-)

Hoping for calm nights
