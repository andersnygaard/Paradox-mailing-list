None:-)

What I would do is hope that Al and Jack and Glen can offer their 
rel life expertise. IIRC I believe most guys launch with an empty 
hull. Load her up with all their gear and then balance it level to 
the LWL with the lead. Then mount it permanently before you do any 
serious sailing.

Most guys seem to start off with things on the light side for 
ballest which gives one a good idea of the perfoamance ability of 
the chine runners as you later get it down to it's lines.

I think Don Elliot has a whole bunch of articles about this at his 
site. All in agonizing mind numbing detailed details.

Ooops did I just say that?
