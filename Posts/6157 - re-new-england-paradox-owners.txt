I too am building with limited space. I have a bulkhead in every closet in the apartment and hooks on the ceiling to hang the spar from when it is finished. I do my hand sanding in the bathtub or bathroom at night and power sand and cut out back during the day. When the hull is ready to be assembled, I will do so, then transfer it to a dolly (hand build) and put it in my parking space while I begin parking my car in the street. Protected with a tarp when not working on it I am hoping all will go well. I have learned alot about things not related to sailing or boatbuilding while working on this project. If I never sail this boat I will not regret the building process. I highly recommend building a boat.

If building space is a problem, make sure you make all the small stuff (mast spars rudder etc.) first while you still have the space empty. once the hull is in there everything gets a bit tight. This also has the advantage that once the hull is finished you are ready to launch, instead of having all those bits and pieces to finish while the hull sings it's siren song.

Think also how much easier and quicker it is to bang in a nail than fiddle about with ties and epoxy fillets. On boats where weight is a problem stitch and glue is an excellent solution, but if you save weight when building a Paradox you just have to buy more lead to make up for it.
