I guess what attracted me to Autumn Leaves was the fact that it was designed from the outset to not have a motor, which is the same philosophy as a Paradox, both being narrow and heavy. 

I would have thought Autumn Leaves should dry out nicely too. If I built an Autumn Leaves there'd be a few Paradox inspired changes though, to make her more seaworthy and simpler to boot. 

The mizzen would go and the rear deck triangle to the last bulkhead would become a watertight compartment. The skeg would be removed and rudder would become a balanced Paradox style deep rudder. I'd replace the 1/4 sides with 1/2 inch sides and forget the stringers. The anchor well and bowsprit would be removed. 

I'd use a yuloh to move her. The mainsail would be replaced with a spritsail which means a shorter and therefore stronger mast and I'd go for a yankee jib. I really like the look of those slatted seats. Those would be comfortable to sit on for long periods, but... 

I don't like being outside in strong sun for long periods of time. With a decent self-steering arrangement, you could lounge for hours in that comfortable chair in the companionway, but... now I'm facing backwards while underway. Not sure that would work. 

A Paradox is like driving a car. You're facing forwards with good visibility with the hatch closed and just your head exposed when the hatch is open. In the end, I'll probably stick with the Paradox. I've got one after all!=C2=A0 If I decide to go big then it needs to be the whole hog, a 30ft keeler and everything that goes with that.
