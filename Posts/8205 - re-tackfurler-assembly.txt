Darren, 

I had a double Y-split on my boat and did not like it, since in some situations it would make the furler bind because of the forced angle in the furling line caused by the side-directional pull.  I reverted to exactly as per plan and had no further troubles.  It seems to me that the capacity for the pivot the move in any direction is important.  Also, I feel the Y weakens the pivot plus I don't like the fact that it adds another joint which can potentially fail.  With the rope as per plan, everything is visual and easy to check for wear.  

BTW, the brass tube specified is hard to find, I had to order a 12 foot length, which means I have 11 feet left in my garage.  If anyone wants the 9 inch length required, I will send it to you no charge if you want to pay for the shipping.  I have posted some before and after photos of my furler in the IOTA folder. So we have pictures of what the "per plan" setup looks like.  If it's good enough for Matt Layden, it's good enough for me.  But I appreciate that some of you are competent enough to dare try to improve it!

Also note that 3/8 inch stainless steel for the bent arm is insufficient, must be 1/2. My first one failed me at an inopportune moment, as I have previously mentioned.
