Hello Jeff,

Thanks for that tip, but I don't think that Google Earth will work for me as I'm a bit of a Luddite and still using a dial-up connection....:-)

It's no hardship for me to follow Bill's voyage on a paper atlas. I just have to use my imagination to fill in the missing detail.

So Jeff, is Noli going to be in the water when Bill comes sailing by?

Hoping for calm nights

Al,
Yeovil, England.
