Jeff,

If you can get past all that the boat is worth the effort.

Jeff,

I'm sorry if I offended you in any manner with my impatince(sp?). It is to my understanding that most sailor's are just as eager as I to get into the water.
I can also relate to the Paradox being a "relaxed sail" as you so put it, but I still don't see what that has to do with wanting the plans to build her. Maybe i'm alittle to eager or perhaps I just voiced my opinion in the wrong spot or on the wrong subject.
In anycase I thank you for the link to their web site, however the e-mail as listed on their site doesn't seem to be working.
Again thank for the time.
Jeff

If you get this impatient this quickly then perhaps Paradox isn't for you. Paradox is more of a relaxed sail.

However, if you still think it a good idea then visit http://www.microcruising.com where you will find all the information you need to get the plans from Dave Bolduc.

Hello again everyone.
I'm getting very desperate. I'm not having any luck what so ever trying to get ahold of plans, book, ect. I'm really getting worried that I may never be able to build the Paradox at all because of this.

I don't know what e-mail address to use, after trying out 2 of them, and both coming back to me saying somekind of problem with the addy.

Should I just give up on this and move on to another boat? Perhaps the plans are no longer around? Or maybe Matt is sailing off somewhere in the wild blue.

Did you ever have the feeling of wanting something so bad, that it create's a whole new type of emotion that is hard to explain? Anybody relate?

Well thanks all. I'm hoping somebody can help out.
Jeff
