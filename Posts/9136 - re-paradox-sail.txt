If you were in the UK I would recommend Exe Sails in Exmouth, Devon. The seem to understand lug sails (which the guys who made my first sail didn't).

If he knows what he is doing the sailmaker should want information from you about how flexible the yard is. Ideally let him have the yard to test himself. When under load the yard will not be straight and the top of the sail should be curved to accommodate this.
