unther also use google ... I am Brazilian, I live in Florian=F3polis, Santa Catarina. Have built several boats, catamarans especially Tiki. I advise you to be careful with design modifications. Small changes can result in a loss of quality, performance or safety. The specifications of a project are the result of study, experience and calculations. Trust the designer, or rather a project that you get such confidence. Anyway, a boat will always be an attempt to get as close as possible of what we want. Boat ideal exists only in our imagination. good construction
