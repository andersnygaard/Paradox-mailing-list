Subject: Re: 2 on board ?

Thank you Alastair!

I've emailed Dave and Wanda to buy plans and building manual and I'm waiting for their answer. I'm not sure I understood completely the Ironsides concept but it seems to me a way of reinforcing bulkhead and save interior space.

Very wise tip about the seat restriction. I'd like to keep a hard roof and will think about a solution of allowing the crew to breath fresh air. It's unlikely that someone would enjoy sailing stuck inside considering the hot days we have here in the summer.

All the best,
