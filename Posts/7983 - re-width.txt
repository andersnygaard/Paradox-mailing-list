Thanks for your thoughts ....

Rolling it out on its side should work for me. There is a concrete path.

What is the weight of the completed but ballasted hull ?

It would probably be easier to take it out sitting upright if this is possible. Does anyone know the width of the completed hull across the widest point of the chine runners ?

Thanks,

Steve
