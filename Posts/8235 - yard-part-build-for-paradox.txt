Subject: Yard Part Build for Paradox

Hello Sailors,

I was wondering about the different types of material you may have used to build the yard.

The wood of choice is DF correct? I thought others decided on a denser wood and commented that the denser wood made the yard heavy; others have used aluminum? -- or at least experimented with aluminum.
 
Have most builders used DF for the yard?

I am now shopping for a good lumber place for wood materials on in the NE area of U.S.

Fair winds,

Deric
