Greetings Paul,

After much thought I have decided to strip Plank the Inside of the bottom instead of on the outside, I have 3/8" ply on the bottom already and I think it will hold up "Close to the Water" better than the strip Planking. Of course I will have to be diligent in not dragging water into the cockpit too. I may only Strip it from Bulkhead #2 back to Bulkhead #4, I don't see where I would need the extra thickness in the forward or aft sections?? {I plan on storing the Anchor on top of the Bow} Just thinking now.

My building has come to a standstill for a couple of days as I hit a buried nail in one of the planks I was cutting today, I'll get back on it Monday. For Now...Lots and Lots of Sanding to do.

Take Care
Dave Blow
