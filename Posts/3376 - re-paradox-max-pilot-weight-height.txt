Aw shucks, Nels. That's almost the kindest thing that anybody has ever offered me for free, and definitely recently.
Regrettably, I must turn it down because 1) I'm not short - I'm just not tall and 2) there is a danger that the wife might like the change and I'd hate to see her happy in my twilight years and 3) who's all that may benefit? What would I get out of it?
