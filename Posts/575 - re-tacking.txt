A boat that won't come about is almost always a victim of too much weight foreward or too much rig aft. I took me a while to realize this years ago when I had the same problem with a bunch of half naked babes sunning themselves on the foredeck :-) A sailboat needs to be astable, that is, you want it to behave so that it will not want to point into the wind without active use of the rudder. A boat is not a weathervane. Move some stuff aft and see what happens. Tell the babes to use the fantail.

Sounds like you are having fun, though. Happy sailing!
