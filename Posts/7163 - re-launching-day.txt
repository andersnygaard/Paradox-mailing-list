There are some photo's of Mike's boat in an album called Mike's Boat. Mike, Lezlie, and I ran into each other at the 2012 Texas 200. This was very exciting for me to actually see a Paradox up close. Mike was generous enough to allow us to climb in, and I would have loved to; unfortunately we were at a remote location known for it's super sticky mud. So I wasn't about to tromp into his boat with all that mudd (up to my knees).

Also I have a great video of Mike tacking into a strong wind, in close quarters, at the Padre Island Yacht Club in Corpus Christi, TX. The video is 300 MB, and I don't know how to edit it down to post here. The boat appears to sail well, and Mike is a smooth sailor. This tack was particularly difficult. Many boats tried, few were able to do it under sail alone, and without incident. Lezlie can attest to that.
