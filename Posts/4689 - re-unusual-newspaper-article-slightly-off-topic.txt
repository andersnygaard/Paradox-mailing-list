The other name for a Chi Rho cross is Pax Cross. This cross consisting of the letters X and P was also known as a Constantine Cross which took the form of a sigla on a labarum - a military standard carried into battle by Constantine's warriors. The sigla or initials XP stood for the first two Greek letters of the word Christ (=D7=D1=C9=D3=D4=CF=D3) i.e., X = Chi [22nd letter of the Greek alphabet], and P = Rho [17th letter of the Greek alphabet].

Pax in Latin means peace, but where the link between the word `paradox' and the Chi Rho cross can be found, for me remains a conundrum.
