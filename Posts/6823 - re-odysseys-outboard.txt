Hello Alexander,

Your paradox is awesome, looks like you put a lot of heart into the boat. I have been on the forum for a few weeks but still can't find a bill of materials that people used to complete their Paradox. I see that you included the amount of money you spent on most areas of the boat, but in South Africa, wood is very cheap. Can you maybe remember roughly the bill of materials you used (excluding the teak) for the hull and mast?

Thank you,
Johan Van Dyk.
