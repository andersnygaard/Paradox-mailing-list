Subject: Paradox Performance questioned
To: paradoxbuilders@yahoogroups.com

Hi all,

I am new on this thread and liked boat since childhood. I live in the Philippine Islands. I want to know more about sailing in particular the Paradox. My question, how does it perform if there are two persons onboard?

Thanks for the input.

Phil
