Glen,
They're shipping now from Amazon.  If it is too late to cancel I'd be glad to exchange your book for an autographed one.  Just please pay $4.00 for my shipping cost and send me your other book.  Or, just give that other book to a friend and get one from me!

Thanks for everyone's support for this book.  I hope to do another small boat book soon.
