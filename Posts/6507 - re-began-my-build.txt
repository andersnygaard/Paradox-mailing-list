Wayne,

Are you planning to build a Paradox?

I am cutting out bulkheads and sides right now.  I then plan to build the rudder and mast.  I am taking the advise of several, and making the smaller parts first while I have more room to build.  So, it may be a while before it starts to look like a boat.  

I will be posting my progress here, and let you know when there is something to see.
