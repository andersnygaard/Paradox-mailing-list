Nick those beams are beautiful. I like the 2 tone and will now build mine like that,

Today I picked up a beautiful piece of Mahogany 1=E2=80=9D x 10=E2=80=9D x 9=E2=80=99 =C2=A0the color is consistent and grain is about as straight as possible and i paid for it $$$

I also picked up 2 of the same size board(s) in White Oak 1 for beam laminates an 1 for bulkhead cleats and a 1- 9mm Loyds Certified Okoume Ply more $$$. If the Oak doesn=E2=80=99t work (bend) I=E2=80=99ll use the Okoume with Mahogany to laminate beams.

* side note! In Devons Plywood boat building book it mentions White Oak as a good wood for boat building but in Paradox plans Matt says to avoid Oak. Maybe he=E2=80=99s referring to Red Oak which is oily (not good for gluing)?

Out of the blue, A old friend called today who happens to be passionate about woodworking, with a well equipped shop. Sunday I will make my first official cuts when the beam laminates are ripped with his table saw! It=E2=80=99s only taken me 9 years to get to this point!!!!
