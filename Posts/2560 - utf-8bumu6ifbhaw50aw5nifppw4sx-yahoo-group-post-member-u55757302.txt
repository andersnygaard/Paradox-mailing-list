Hi All,

Being in the Environmental buisness I would highly recomend requesting MSDS sheets on all products you use on your boats. They can be helpfull and possibly save your life. They are free of charge and must be provided upon request (Fed. Law). Theres some real nasty stuff out there, protect yourself. 

For what its worth

Hi Dave,

The paint I used was Awlgrip, 1qt, and I got three coats on with a little left over. It was rolled and tipped. Roll the paint on vertically (no more then about 6sq ft at a time) and then tip with a foam brush horizontally. I always keep about 4 extra brushes in my pockets incase I get a blowout or the brush gets soggy. Move quickly and put it on thin. Always brush into the last area you brushed and not the other way around. This will work well for enamels also but I have found that Awlgrip is the cheapest paint to buy because it holds up so well (10 yrs) and the gloss doesn't fade, and it goes so far. A 1 qt kit (paint, H3002 converter and T0031 reducer) will give you 53 oz of paint.

Yes I have used the HVLP outfits and love them but I would not recommend spraying Awlgrip or any other two part polyurethane paint because when atomized they are very poisonous, so mush so that the the person spraying should be wearing a full face mask and breathing an oxygen rich mixture.

Hope this helps, let us know how they come out

Glen
