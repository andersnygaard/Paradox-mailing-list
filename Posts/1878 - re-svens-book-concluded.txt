Guilty as charged!

I proposed it as a possible option since a friend of mine has a publishing company in Sweden and has a PayPal set up. This is a viable option in my mind since it saves all the extra expense of printing, packaging and shipping and handling, which can often double the cost of the list price. Of course he also sells and distributes printed books as well.

My keen team of tranlators is wondering what is happening with this. So what should I tell them?

Cheers, Nels
