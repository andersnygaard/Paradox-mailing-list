Hi Emile,

I am wondering if you noticed that Adelie had already been discussed in some previous postings?

One part of the design that was found questionable is that the cockpit has no backrests - just some straps and that could result in a wet backside;-)

I am a bit leery of boat designs that have not been built yet but are only computer generated images.

I live in Saskatchewan and have a Bolger Micro. I see it as superior in design to Adelie in several areas. Are you familar with it? I like the prospect of building ones own carbon fiber most though.

Just remember I am biased also. I love Paradox - but it is just too small for what I wanted.

We need someone to come forward and enlarge the Paradox by 20%!

Cheers, Nels
