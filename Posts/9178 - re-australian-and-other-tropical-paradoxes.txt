Stick your head and shoulders out of the cabin

Have the cabin roof all the way open and enjoy the breeze
I've sailed mine in temps over 40 degrees
The life jacket gets uncomfortable to wear , so a dip in the ocean during the trip is a must
Sleeping in it at night is ok too , there is enough air in it , I have to keep the lights off though or a lot of insects show up
