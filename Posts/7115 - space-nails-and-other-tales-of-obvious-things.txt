Subject: Space nails and other tales of obvious things

About a week ago when I received the plans, I was quickly confused by space nails. I found the translation to bronze nails to my language but space nails, I found no reference!

I looked at catalogs, old type of nails, maybe the name of these nails changed after Matt made the plans and I think I was not far from doing a search on the NASA site... when I realized "space nails" only means about separating the nails, not some spacecraft nails.

Possibly not extreme like this but do you have other stories about obvious things you realized during construction or the understanding of plans?

Thank you
Fernando
