Seeing a number in millimeters is just a number. I see things in inches and feet.

Ha yes, Here in the Uk we've had the metric measure for about 40 years and it's taken me most of that time to be get used to it....
.But we've only half converted  Beer in the pub is sold by the pint  though in the supermarket it's by the litre as are most other liquids.. Road signs are in yards and miles, so we have a confusing mixture.
Australia. has made a better job of it and is nearly all metric.

But seriously, It's very convenient to use and makes boaty calculation so easy. For instance ...........1 litre of water weighs 1 kilogram , so 1 cubic metre of water weighs 1000 Kg and so on..
Much easier than using gallons , cubic feet and pounds, or whatever.
