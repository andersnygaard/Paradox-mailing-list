Brave man! There will be be a lot of people watching with interest to see how the increase in size works. Be sure to let us know if it is still practical to trail with the extra ballast.

I can see this being a major irritation and a recipe for a banged head. The ability to drop the sail to the side deck instantly is highly desirable.

You also appear to be solving a problem that I don't see on my boat.
