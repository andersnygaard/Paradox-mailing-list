Well done with the progress so far. Glad to see it is coming together OK.

A note on the stem piece: after I had Little Jim afloat for a few months I added a sacrificial piece of wood to the lower part of the stem. This takes the wear and tear of coming in on a beach and hitting the odd rock and saves a lot of maintenance time as I just replace it every few years.
