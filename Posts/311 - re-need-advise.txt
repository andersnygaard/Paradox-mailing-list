Glen, I checked the interior completely, I pulled some of the floatation out it looks good. I did find a place aft of bulkhead # 3 The size of a half dollar on the bottom, its just on the surface,  its solid  under it. it looks like rain water sat there, that part of the ply is turning black about half way up the storage bins (black but solid). I think I need to pull all of the foam out and check it. It looks like this boat sat up a while with no use.
