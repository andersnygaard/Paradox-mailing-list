Thanks Al
 That's encouraging.

None. The only water that gets in is what I bring on board myself, either on my shoes when launching off a beach or, occasionally, when the inspection hatches on the ballast tanks leak. I keep a sponge in the bottom of the locker behind bulkhead 3 which collects it all. I squeeze it out every 2 or 3 days if it needs it.

Hoping for calm nights

Al,
Yeovil, England.
