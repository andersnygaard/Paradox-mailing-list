I have used my Paradox with an electric motor strapped on the port side next to the hatch. I used the rudder for steering with the motor fixed. It may have turned slightly quicker to stbd than to port, but it doesn't turn quickly either way anyway. 

I think his biggest problem is going to be the depth of the prop and exhaust. If he leans over the side to start it the exhaust will be pushed down and starting will be very difficult. If it is shallow enough to start easily then the prop will be out of the water if he leans the other way.

I might be wrong, of course.
