Guy,

I don't know how familiar you are with the paradox so it's hard to answer some questions, for example, all the sail controls including reefing are done from the helm station and you have to release the sheet to roller furl the sail, there is no going forward. if you visit David Bolduc's site at: http://home.triad.rr.com/lcruise/paradox1.htm you will be able to see some study plans and more particulars. I plan on taking a week long sea trial next Monday on the Fl gulf coast. Hopefully I will get more wind then I have been graced with so far. I should be able to answer more questions then.

Tailwinds, 
Glen
