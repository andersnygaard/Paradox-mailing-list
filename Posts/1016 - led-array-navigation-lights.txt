Subject: LED array navigation lights?
Date: Wed, 18 Jun 2003 21:43:08 -0700 (PDT)

Does anyone know a good source for LED array navigation lights?  I'm just about to the point where I need to start thinking about running the wiring before the deck goes on.  I'm under 20 feet, and don't have a motor, so USCG approval isn't strictly necessary, but would be nice.

I'd like to run everything off rechargeable dry cells and a solar charger, where "everything" consists of just the nav lights and a night light for the compass.  (And maybe a LED array reading light in the main cabin.)

Does anyone have experience with such things?  I had originally thought to use the self-contained dinghy nav lights, but they'd be out of reach from the cockpit, and I don't want to have to crawl around on the ends of the deck to turn them on....
