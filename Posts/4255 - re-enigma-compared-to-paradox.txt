Subject: Re: enigma compared to paradox

Paradox is exceptionally strong, being a heavy displacement vessel; such construction is part of Matt's strategy by helping to bring her to her designed draft, but even then he incorporated lead ballast for trimming, along with water ballast.

Enigma is almost a different creature, because she's a light displacement boat, relying mostly on the crew and a heavy plywood bottom to keep her upright when sailing to windward.

There are many parts to Paradox, whereas Enigma is simple by comparison; hence the build time for Enigma is only a fraction of the time needed for Paradox.

A lot will depend on what a person 'needs'.  Those who want a lightweight day sailer for one person will plump for Enigma, but the person who wants more comfort and a more sea kindly motion will go for Paradox.  Paradox is a far more able boat for coasting, although she may not be as fast as Enigma.  Paradox has to lug around her weight, hence she's not the fastest 14 footer, but she's a great live-aboard boat for periods up to 3 months away from base - longer for those who like that sort of thing.

Enigma could be built in a few months, but Paradox will take about 1 and 1/2 years.

Cheers,
Bill.
