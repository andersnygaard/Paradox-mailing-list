Subject: Re: Removable back window for Paradox


I'm glad you enjoyed the webpage on our rear window setup aboard Little Cruiser. I think this arrangement works really well for the type of coastal sailing and island hopping that we do. However, if I were ever to take our boat for a serious and long ocean passage across the Atlantic or the Pacific, I might think about glueing the window shut with some 3M 5200 beforehand.

By the way, I tried to send you an email Derek C. about the removable rear window for ENUF, but my mail keeps getting bounced back.
