Hi Brian,

Very glad to hear from you. I appreciate your thoughts on the matter.

My build will be slow and steady as I have too much other summer activities. Usually the winter is house projects, and now it is time to get the sailboat out and work on my RAVE sailboat too. I have been looking at the pictures in the yahoo group, and researching. I will study and start this summer on the boat.

I think it would be great to know of your build. The Enigma does look very interesting as well. Where are you located in PA? Are you far from Syracuse?

Sounds like you already have boat building experience. I have repaired FG boats and such but never worked on a wood boat. This will be a great learning opportunity.

I should very much like to see your Enigma after you have completed her.

Let me know how it goes... stay in touch.

Deric
