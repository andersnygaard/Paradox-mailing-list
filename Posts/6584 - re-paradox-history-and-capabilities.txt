Not sure what you mean by "design requirements". The designer says it is a coastal cruiser. I am sure it has better open water survivability than many small craft that have made ocean crossings. Certainly better than a West Wight Potter, for example. And because you aren't sitting out in the weather, it is much more comfortable than them as well.

Hoping for calm nights
