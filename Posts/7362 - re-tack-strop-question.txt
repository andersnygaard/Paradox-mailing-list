Subject: Re: Tack Strop Question...

I nearly suggested something of the sort.

Where 2 materials impinge in this manner it is a good idea to arrange 
it so that the one which will suffer most damage that is easiest to 
fix/replace. The end of my pipe is looking a bit bashed about, I may 
have to replace it in a couple of years.

Very much appreciate the response. I was not sure I was reading the
plans correctly. What an incredible tool the internet is!  Here we are
oceans apart and I can get help from you completing my boat. Awesome.
I also not too infrequently  chat and email with a countryman of
yours, Dylan Winter.   ;-)

I have occasionally exchanged emails with him myself.

Have you sorted out the mast drawing yet? It has caused some 
confusion in the past as there is a minor mistake (unless this has 
been fixed by now). Have fun with the build, and more fun with the 
sailing.
