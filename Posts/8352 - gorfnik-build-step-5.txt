For a mast step, I used an 8 by 3 by 1 1/2 inch hardwood block and shaved the bottom at an angle to match the curve of the boat so the top ended up parallel to the deck. This I glued and screwed to a larger plywood patch which would give more area for support. I squeezed and wedged two temporary pieces of wood under the deck plank to hold down the plywood/maststep combination while the epoxy dried.

The black piece is a simple 1 1/4 inch ABS plumbing cap into which I will later glue a 1 1/4 inch (inside diameter) ABS pipe which will extend 1 inch above the deck. This way it is impossible for water to come into the boat through the mast hole.

In use, as I insert the 1 1/4 inch (outside diameter) aluminium mast, any water in the pipe is forced upward and empties itself. The first time I inserted the mast after a rain, I was surprised by a face splash. Now I insert the mast more s l o w l y.

The mast itself is 12 feet 6 inches long. I started at 14 feet and tested by slowly cutting it down until it was right, the sail just clearing my head. At first I used a standard aluminium tube (3.5 lbs), but it bent way too much under stress in spite of the forestay I added and I had to go purchase a 20 foot 1 1/4 inch best grade aluminium which was also thicker walled (7 lbs). This mast still bends under stress, but now I feel it is just right to spill wind in strong gusts. More on this later.

In the picture (Gorfnik album), you will also see how the 3/8 inch anchoring eye bolt comes through the forward lower crosspiece. This bolt needs to be strong, because it is used to winch the boat up onto the trailer as well as for anchoring and towing if need be.
