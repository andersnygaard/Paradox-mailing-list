Good work!

A couple of amendments:

Bill Sergeant (row 9) built Faith but subsequently sold her to Jim Hall, Shaftesbury UK.

Derek Clark (row 7) built Enuf then sold her to Robert Beigler (row 12). He sold her to Bill Sergeant who renamed her Minnow and has since sold her to Richard Green.

I also have vague recollections of:

Petite Lady in New Zealand built, I think, by Hugh Miller but now owned by P D Benn.

One built in Sweden by Kjell Karlsson.

Raffles built by Mark Waters in Sacramento California.
