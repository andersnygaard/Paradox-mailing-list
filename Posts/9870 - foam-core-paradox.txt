Hello Everybody,

I am interested in building Paradox. I know that some boats were built with foam core. I don't have much experience with boat building but I used foam and epoxy/fiberglass in my kiteboard builds.

Does anybody have any suggestions regarding laminate schedule of a Paradox that would be built with 1 inch marine PVC foam core?

Regards,
Kris
