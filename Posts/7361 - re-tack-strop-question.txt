Subject: Re: Tack Strop Question...

Thank you Alastair

I wonder if a small stainless or bronze plate on the deck right there might be in order??  

Very much appreciate the response. I was not sure I was reading the plans correctly. What an incredible tool the internet is!  Here we are oceans apart and I can get help from you completing my boat. Awesome. I also not too infrequently chat and email with a countryman of yours, Dylan Winter.   ;-)
