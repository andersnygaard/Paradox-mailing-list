Respecting everybodys reasons for having or not having a motor, I do have a heavy 80's johnson 6 hp mounted on a folding mount, offset, I mount the plastic gas can between the two rear cleats, I also strap a bungee cord over the cover to the cleat and the sheet does not foul, unless too much slack, and then the rudder is usually the culprit. If i had more time, more money, etc etc I would go out without the motor, or get a smaller motor, but this setup does not strip the boat of her sailing abilty or stabilty... adjust ballast....

If I had the time and perfect health I would sail without it, sadly this isnt the case, but I found what works for me... on a postive note, I can go a long long way with a small amount of gas.
I agree with you Nels, properly vented!!! a must!! I will not ever bring the fuel inside, once you mount a internal tank the rules change.

I wouldnt count out the paradox if the only thing holding you back is the outboard decision.
