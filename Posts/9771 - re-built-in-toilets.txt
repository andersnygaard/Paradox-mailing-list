Hi there,

Have you considered a dry toilet? It is a cheap option, especially if it is a DIY project. It's also clean, odorless, and simple to use. A dry toilet can hold waste for one person for about five days. When it comes to disposal, if you don't have any other solutions, it can be easily composted.

Best regards,
