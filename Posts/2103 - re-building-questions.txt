Subject: Re: building questions


Its a bit more involved than a typical stitch and glue boat, I would say its not really a first timers first project, however if you already have experience with woodworking and building its not too bad, I enjoy building them as much as sailing them. I am sewing my own sails as it is a very simple sail design. I started Jan 1st or so, and have been at it part time and off and on, I expect to be on the water soon. as far as price or what its worth I guess it would be a number of factors, ie type of plywood, degree of finish, quality of work, quality of hardware... my guess would be anywhere from 2k to 8k US an old saying goes,.... an item is worth what someone will pay for it :P
