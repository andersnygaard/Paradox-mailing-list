Hello,

Has paradox in Europe already been built? Have they been arranged for on the North Sea? I have ordered the plans and the construction book. I live in Belgium. I can use all information concerning the paradox. I have never sailed this problem.

My email is renzo.callebert@telenet.be.

Kind regards,
Renzo Callebert
