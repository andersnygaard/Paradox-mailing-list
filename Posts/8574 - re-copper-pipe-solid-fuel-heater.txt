As designed the Paradox has 2 inches of foam lining the sides and deck. This provides floatation (in case of a swamping), soundproofing (all those slapping halyards) and insulation. 

I believe Bill never fitted this on Faith, which may explain why Jim felt the need to fit his heater.

I have the insulation and have never felt the need for a heater, even when it snowed or when I woke with 1 inch of frost on the deck (first night afloat!).

Mostly my body heat keeps everything comfortable but, occasionally, it is cold when I come back on board in the evening. In these circumstances I make a coffee before going to bed and this heats everything up nicely.

Perhaps foam may be simpler, less dangerous, less messy and less trouble (though perhaps not as much fun) as a heater.
