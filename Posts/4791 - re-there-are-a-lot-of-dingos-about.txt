Less than a quarter. This is when loaded for a 2 week cruise 
(including 3 anchors).

Lots of the stuff is there because it may be useful, but if it wasn't 
there I would have to add extra lead ballast to compensate.

I find myself feeling mildly smug when I see discussions about the 
difficulty in carrying everything and the need to reduce weight. If I 
think it might be useful I might as well take it as there is no 
penalty.
