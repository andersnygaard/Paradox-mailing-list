Dave;

I'm pretty sure that this has been asked before, but I could not find it in the archives, so sorry if it's been beaten to death.

I feel that Paradox is just too small for me. I am much more interested in Lil Cruiser, or even something marginally bigger: 15'11" would suit me admirably. Is there any chance that at least Lil Cruiser plans would ever be made available?

Perhaps some alternative questions are:

* How hard is it to actually design a Laden-style sharpie?
* How hard is it to take a paradox and increase it to Lil Cruiser size?

Regards,
