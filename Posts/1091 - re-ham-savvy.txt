Subject: Re: HAM savvy?

Mindy and I used an "Outbacker" vertical antenna for most of our Bahamas trips. We found that this antenna worked "okay" and that it was pretty durable. However, for our latest trip we employed a less durable $35 homemade "buddipole" (http://www.qsl.net/w3ff/), and we found that our transmissions were much better. Of course, if you had a tall mast, you could use a long wire (insulated back stay), but in our case, this isn't possible. 

Incidentally, we regularly check into the Waterway Radio and Cruising Club net on 7.268 Mhz (http://www.jstorm.com/wrcc/) while we are away. They meet each morning to take float plans, to receive position reports, to handle general traffic, and to read the NOAA forecast. 

Another thing to think about while you are out cruising is the use of "Winlink 200/Airmail," which allows you to send/receive e-mail and receive weatherfaxes for free with your HF rig (http://winlink.org/airmail.htm). Of course, you will also need to have a computer and a modem. We got to try this system out on a friend's boat, and it was pretty neat. 

Finally, the attached picture is of the buddipole partially raised up the mast.
