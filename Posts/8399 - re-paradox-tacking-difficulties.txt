Hi Bob,

Sorry to mislead you. It's the strong weathercocking tendency that the boat has when stopped that makes her reluctant to sail off on a new tack. Not the same as weather helm - (force required to keep the tiller to up to windward while sailing).

There is weather helm when sailing to windward which allows the boat to round up smartly if you release the helm. But I wouldn't say that it's excessive. All quite easy to control really. The rudder is sufficiently powerful to steer the boat easily. You can 'adjust' the WH force by altering the length of the line which raises the rudder...

But, good as the rudder is when sailing along, it doesn't work when stopped....

Best,
Jim

You've raised a good point there John about the specifications. I have noticed that nearly every Paradox has been modified in some way from the original. Whether these changes are deliberate or inadvertent I couldn't say. I remember when I saw Petite Lady in Auckland several years ago, I was surprised to see that the aft part of the chine runners had been cut off. I asked why and was told that she wasn't balanced (I assume she had lee helm). Yet Jim tells us that his boat has excessive weather helm.

Based on these differences, I think I will do a polytarp sail first up and cut it about until Mini is balanced. Maybe after that I will get a "real" sail.
