Hello,

I'm not sure if I'm allowed to go or not. Just had 12 days away in 'Faith'. Launched and recovered at Ridge Wharf and then spent the time mooching about mainly in the Solent and Chi harbour. When I got back, the grass in the garden was a foot high and the dog didn't recognize me...

A lot depends on my Missus. She's due for a knee replacement op very soon and we're not exactly sure when we'll get the call.

So we'll see.

Jim
