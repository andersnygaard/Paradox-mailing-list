Subject: First test

Hello friends,

We begin with the first tests to "Cachivache" weighted with 200 kilos and 9 knots wind sail. Then we noticed the rapid response to the rudder and excellent performance of wind on the boat fin.

On the beat, I derive a bit but it was easy control to maintain the course. It behaves beautifully, low heel, and back we trace the ebb current laughed. We still practice the rolling of the sail; we will practice it a few days out to sea.
