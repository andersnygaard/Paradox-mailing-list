I agree with Jim, remove the dividers in the "forward stateroom".

I store my emergency change of clothes and my wellington boots in the fore-peak, my clothes, sleeping bag, air bed, outboard motor (electric), inflatable tender, battery charger and bicycle in the forward stateroom. Food and water for at least a week goes under the port floor locker (it is usually about half full), with nibbles, crisps, coffee etc in the stbd rear bin. Tools, spare anchor, chain, rope etc are in the stbd floor locker. The fwd side lockers have my wet weather gear and wet shoes (several pairs) and spare gas cans. the rear port side locker is mostly empty except for my binoculars and rubbish bin. The stern locker holds my cooker etc, anchor with chain and rope, mooring ropes, fenders and in-use water bottle. The side shelves hold odds and sods like gloves, papers, coffee mug, camera, radio, torch and anything I just want to put down for a minute.

None of the lockers are full to capacity. I really don't feel I am short of storage space. My friends in more conventional dinghies are jealous of how much storage I have.

I do agree that crossing an ocean in a paradox is a silly idea. What is the point in owning a boat like that if you don't put it on the ferry?
