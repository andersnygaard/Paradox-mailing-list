Hi Pete.
The sailmaker I have used for years now is Graham Caws. His details:-

Company Name: Caws Sails 
Address: Unit 16 
Somerton Ind. Park 
Newport Road 
City: Cowes 
County: Isle of Wight 
Postcode: PO31 8PB 
Country: United Kingdom 
Phone: 01983 299397 
Fax: 01983 299397 
Contact Name: G Caws 

I have used him for about 30 years now and his work is always tip-top.
He specializes in race sails, in particular windsurfers, Moths and Cherubs as well as catering for the cruising set.
He likes the odd challenge.
And they don't come odder than me. I certainly give them to him.
The thing I like about Graham is he listens and was not offended when I gave him Matt's instructions on this latest thoughts of his Mk2 PARADOX sail.
