Subject: Double Rudders

I appreciate Paradox is a well-developed boat, but I'm interested in the possibility of fitting two rudders working together. The advantage is being able to fit an outboard motor on the centre line.

Working out the steering mechanics would need to be thought through.

Additionally, there is a windvane self-steering unit produced in the UK that can readily be attached to an outboard bracket. Therefore either the engine or the self-steering unit could be fitted at a moment's notice.

Maybe the sheeting would get snarled up on the windvane?

I'll be interested to have feedback.

Cheers,
Bill.
