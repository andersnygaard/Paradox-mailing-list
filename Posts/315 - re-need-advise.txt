Hi Glen,

I just got back from 3 days on the river, the lows were in the mid 20's and the highs were mid 40s, when I left it was starting to sleet and snow. I was pretty comfortable and she handled ok, I'm still learning to sail her though. I did learn one lesson, be careful of a lee shore if you have to claw off into the wind. I tried to come about to late....she wouldn't do it....I got smashed up and grounded on a 20 ft rock ledge. I had to get out and push (the water was DAMN COLD) It rained most of the time... I stayed high and dry in the cabin. Its a little uncomfortable though, I'm thinking of getting a child's bean bag, maybe that will help. The vent system works to well, going to have to cover it for cold weather sailing.

I would like to see if anybody is interested in coming down and having a sail before we set a date. What about it guys? Its about 8 hrs from Memphis. Its warm down there!!!!!!
