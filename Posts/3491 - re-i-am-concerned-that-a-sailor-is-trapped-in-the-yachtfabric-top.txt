wonder where one could source one of those plexiglass dome thingies to fit in the existing hatch. Would there be enough room for it under the boom?

No problem with the height, as the boom is well clear of your head. However your head is quite near the back of the opening (See <http://www.as4jg.freeuk.com>) so the dome would have to be a bit truncated at the rear. Also (small point) getting on and off the seat would involve sliding your bottom forward and down to get your head out unless the dome went well forward.

These ideas, and more occurred to me when I was starting to build but it occurred to me that none of this is structural, so I built as-designed knowing that I could easily build a number of hatches if I wanted to and ring the changes to see what was best.

Having sailed now for 3 seasons I find that the perceived shortcomings did not exist in practice and I can think of few modifications that would be worth the effort (though proper hatch runners is one of them). YMMV.

Ah, but you don't need to sit on the cabin sole for a long period of wet weather do you Al? Just put up the brolly over your head.

I like that one. Read somewhere that an umbrella and a hat stand were the most useless things on a small boat. Now just need to find a use for the hat stand.
