Glen, I cannot believe you did not buy a PARADOX for $500, just because the trailer was to high. You should have bought it and sold the trailer and found the right one. Thats =A3340 over here in Blighty. For that over here all you could buy would be something like a crappy MIRROR DINGHY. $500 Strewth, surely you mean $50000.
What was it like, was it complete, what was the workmanship like, have you taken any photo's of it?
