Hi Alastair,

Do you mean the ringnails? Can you get SS ringnails?
If cost is very important you could probably get away with galvanized as it is all encapsulated in epoxy, but don't expect it to last as long.

Actually I was meaning the fabricated bits like the hoops for holding the yuloh and mast, the rudder hardware and the reefing bit on the forward end of the boom.

I wouldn't have thought about a lightning rod but it was on the plan so I guess I may as well put it on. (I don't know anything about how they work or how often boats get hit by lightning here but I doubt if it will hurt and shouldn't add much to the cost).

I think 12mm is standard here too.

Thanks
