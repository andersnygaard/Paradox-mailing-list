Subject: Re: The Classic Paradox Boat "Zoe" Destroyed in Transport

Although Glen may contribute some of his own recollections and a eulogy, I visited his article on the launching at duckworks. A nice -re-read of the boat's origins and of the paradox allure.

I have yet to give up all hope - I intend to demand the replacement value from the trucker's insurance company. I am in touch with a couple of wooden boat builders for a quote...

Price? I fully expect 22 to 25K. But I am growing too old to wait another 10 years for a boat ... so if insurance pays for it expect a new Zoe...who knows, I may be asking for any small improvements that might be made from the group.
