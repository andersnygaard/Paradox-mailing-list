Subject: Wood arrived today

I was shocked when the wood for my Paradox was delivered today from Robbins of Bristol, because there was so much of it. Labels on the packaging informed me I should check it all before signing, but that was not possible due to circumstances. I simply made a note about this when signing for the delivery. Maybe tomorrow I'll have time to sort through it.

I've completed all the beams, including the cabin and hatch beams. I've laminated the tiller and tomorrow I hope to shape it. I've started drawing out the bulkheads on the plywood.

Bill.
