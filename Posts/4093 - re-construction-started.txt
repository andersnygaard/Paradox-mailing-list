Bill,
Your boat is coming on really well. I think it's going to be quite stunning when finished. It's great to have all these photos, as it makes it a lot easier to make sense of some of the more difficult parts of the plans.

I marked out my gash chipboard stock today with the lines for the Cabin beams, and also a template for the tiller.

I can't find anywhere where the length of the cabin beams is stated. I've made the jig 800mm long, I expect the beams are cut to fit after cabin frame is installed (that will be a long way off!)

The tiller I had to extrapolate from sheet #4 and #11 as there doesn't seem to be anywhere that gives the offsets. I hope it works out OK.
