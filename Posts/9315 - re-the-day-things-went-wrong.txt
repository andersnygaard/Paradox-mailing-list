Wow,,, what a story. 

I always think that anytime one comes back from sailing alive and well it is a good day. I can only imagine the frustration and the stress you must have had.

There are some good tips mentioned with this topic. For me the one I shall be mindful is the chine runner on the foot possibility. Easy to forget that the little wing is out there a few more inches.

I plan to sail "The Edge" without a motor. My other boats all have some auxiliary help. I believe I shall be challenged many times when faced with situations when a motor will be most helpful.

I enjoy reading the stories and challenges met with reflections on improving and/or tips from others. The most focused tip I try to practice with myself is try to remain calm so that decisions are not just guy reactions when faced with challenges. It is the best tip I give myself and try to practice in the event of high stress moment.
