Glen, and group,

I spoke to Sven Lundin several times a few years ago about his process, and one of the main points he continually emphasized was that by using Divinyl and the special resin he created a boat that was flexible.  He DIDN'T want a stiff hull, he wanted one that could hit a log or a floating container at sea and bounce off.

I would think using epoxy would obviate that advantage. Vinylester might be better, but if you contact the makers of Divinyl (they sell it in the US too) they could give you the best advice.

Just my 2 cents,
Bill Longyard
