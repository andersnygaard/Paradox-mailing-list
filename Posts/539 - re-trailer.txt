Subject: Re: Trailer

At one time I was actually thinking of mounting a pair of torsion axles in the boat structure, say at bulkhead #3 in such a way that once launched the axles, with wheels attached, could be unbolted(0r better still unpinned) from inside and then pulled away from the side while the boat was floating. In a similar manner the towbar could be attached to the stem. Wheel/axles and towbar could then be stowed in the tow vehicle until needed again and the mounting ports in the side of the boat and stem could be covered. I still think the idea has merit and I'm sorry I didn't develop it farther.
