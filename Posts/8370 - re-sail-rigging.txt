I did find the retaining screw binding and I didn't get the hole in the end of the boom perfectly centered. this causes a little wobbling as the boom turns, other than that the boom dimensions are nearly perfect the only error is where the fiberglass is wrapped on the spool end and it's only minimal, the video was great a picture is worth a thousand words. I didn't realize the technique was to spool both lines at the same time. I was lowering the arm and then rolling the boom. I think I will try a topping lift of some kind.
