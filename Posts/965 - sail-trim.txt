Hi All,

My sail set's great on all points except one. Anytime I'm on a starboard tack or any point where the boom and yard are against the mast. when I get my tell tales to fly right I get a little flutter on the leading edge of the sail. If I tighten the main sheet to stop the flutter my tell Tales are off a little. I cant tell much differience in speed, bit it seems when I get the fluttering to stop the sail is sheeted in too tight. Any ideas ?
