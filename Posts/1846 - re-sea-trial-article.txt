Hi Glen,

I enjoyed reading `Paradox Sea Trials'. Many thanks for the article. Would you allow me to make it available for visitors to http://www.paradox-uk.co.uk? Copyright would, of course, be yours, but I'm not sure how this works with MAIB. If your answer is affirmative I'll be able to copy everything from your file and upload it to my web site.

I was interested that you use a bag for the stowage of your main anchor. Do you keep a chain and warp permanently attached to the anchor?

The other query I have is about using a topping lift. Matt seems to get along without one. What is the experience of others with, or without topping lifts?

Cheers,
Bill.
