Subject: Re: Home Made Epoxy Pumps

Some people prefer to measure quantities in callibrated cups, but I find the pumps work well for me. I bought mine from Epoxy Resins UK a good many years ago and I have built 3 boats using the same pumps!! If you use pumps, make sure the nozzles are regularly cleaned, then you should have a trouble free time. I really don't think it is worth the hassle of making your own pumps.
