My paradox has (will have) both a tricolour and white-all-round light built into a mast-head unit less than 2" diameter and 1.5" tall. Using LEDs either the white or tricolour uses about one tenth the power of a filament bulb for the same output

I only use 2 wires up the mast, as the diodes are wired in opposite directions. So connect to the battery one way round for white and reverse polarity for tricolour.

I have no steaming light as I am not intending to use an engine (this may prove to be a mistake :-)

Hi All,

Why does Paradox and Little Cruiser have a mast head light and not the green/red running lights?
