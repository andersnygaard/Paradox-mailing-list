Hi Steve,

Haven't done much sailing on the St-Lawrence... yet. I have sailed a bit near Tadoussac, once went around the south of Orleans island in my Gorfniks, and once sailed my Paradox through Thousand Island National Park. Looking forward to doing all of it soon, another project. Life is too short!

To do the St-Lawrence, you have to do a lot of homework, because of major currents and powerful tides, plus shoals. Oh yes, and lots of commercial maritime traffic. 

I remember standing in calm knee deep water on the shore of Orleans island while boarding my Gorfnik and getting hit from behind by an unsuspected 5 foot wave caused by a Tanker having gone through towards Québec city on the other side of the river. Lesson learned. 

Another event was when 3 of my buddy adventurers floated down the St-Lawrence between Three Rivers and Québec city on a large piece of ice (my idea) for promotion purposes. They got into a lot of trouble for having disrupted maritime traffic, made national headlines.

Cheers,

André
