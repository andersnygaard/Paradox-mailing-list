Those are four stainless steel #10-32 flat head screws and Nylock stainless steel nuts and washers underneath. I wanted them to hold a good luff tension and any Wind loads as well. This photo has one screw missing. By the way, a #10 screw "here" is 4.8 mm dia. The nice piece of string Matt uses is also "low technology" which is easy to repair and replace far from home. :) And by comparison what my design loses in ease of manufacture and economy it makes up for in being impossible to repair far from home. My normal mode. :) So I like to make things nearly impossible to break. I absolutly hate repairing things which weren't made properly to begin with.

I have discovered while working on my sail that the process of basting together the cloth reinforcement patches is more easy that I thought. It uses a double sided tape whis is almost invisible. The pieces of sailcloth are almost like working with stiff paper or plastic film. It hardly behaves like cloth at all.
