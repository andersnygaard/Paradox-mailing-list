Hello Jeff

Somewhere on the web I found a site called "Jeffs New Boat", which shows a Paradox sized boat constructed as per Enigma with  a small 'v' folded into the forward end of the bottom panels. This boat is quotes as being 13'11 x 3'11 1/2" ......slightly smaller than Paradox....I had thought this might be your project. If you are now working on a larger version, I am interrested to know more. I am also interrested to here how the smaller boat is doing.
