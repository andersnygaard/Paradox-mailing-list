Hi Jeff

I learned to sail at school in wayfarer and mirror dinghies.What I most recall was the constant effort which they required,and the constant vigilance regarding rudder and mainsheet control.It was a nerve wracking experience and after nearly losing my ear on a wire kicking strap during a jybe I gave up sailing for several years.
During this time I read a very old book on canoe sailing.The helmsman controlled these very narrow and theoretically unstable craft from a semi recumbant position.
Eventually I bought a sea snark and sailed it in a similar way.I found it totally relaxing.The sail was small and all the gear very light and simple-everything was easy.It takes a while to realise that as the boat heels the sail spills wind,and it comes back up again.You can, and often do, ease the sheet or luff up,but you seldom really have to.Your weight is greater than the boat and it's close to the waterline.You completely overwhelm the boat-at least in the sort of conditions you are likely to be out in.
Optimist dinghies are popular where I live and they seem to manage very well even with the chances the racing helmsman are taking.I've seen them racing in force 8.They are only slightly less of a box than the pdracer.
Cheers Neil
