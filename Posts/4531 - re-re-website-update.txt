That's why I decided to postpone the start of my West Country cruise!
I've been watching the forecasts which have given warnings of rain and high winds.  The weather is still unsettled, but I'm pinning my hopes on the Azores 'high' moving norhtwards and eastwards; if this happens we should have a better spell of weather.

The DCA holiday meeting at St Just in Roseland starts on 7th July and finishes on 14th July.  Both Al and I hope to meet up there around the 9th.  If the weather has settled by then we may have a shot at the Scilly Isles.

Bill.
