Hi Bill,

That is why I am wondering how many pages there are and how many chapters and suggest getting several people.

I already have two, and possibly three people who are willing to do some translating. I have a friend who has already tranlated one book from English into Norwegian and is able to translate Swedish into English as well. If I know three people and you know one, then it splits it up a lot. 

There are three steps that can be perhaps used and the same person doesn't have to perform them all.

First is to scan the book and break it down into chapters. Send a chapter to each translator to do essentially a literal translation and then have it technically edited by someone like yourself.

Then the final blessing from Sven. This may take 6 months or more but it could be done I would suggest.

Cheers, Nels
