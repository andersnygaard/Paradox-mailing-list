Subject: Re: Water Collection

I built the system as drawn, using conventional deck fittings. It works as advertised for filling, and by using a bung that fits in the deck fitting I can pump out (or when on the trailer syphon out) the water at the end of a trip. I don't intend to use the water for drinking, though in an emergency I could. The main disadvantage I have found is that you have to get within hosepipe distance of a tap to fill up, or else pour (slowly) from cans.

If you are using jugs or lead for ballast, unless you particularly want to be able to collect rain water, I wouldn't bother with any of the pipework. After all, It's another hole in the deck for water to leak in.
