Subject: Re: Engine for the Paradox

Going back to the original question.
I have a Suzuki 2.5 on Johanna.
Going down the river last year I never opened it above tickover to achieve 4 knots cruising speed.
On the odd occasions I've had to punch into wind and chop I may have opened it up to 1/8th throttle.
I have no idea how it behaves at half or full revs as I've never needed to, or had the urge to try!
Anything bigger is overkill - power, weight, size.
If a small 1 HP petrol (gas) engine were available I'd trade up!
There are 4 problems with the engine:
1. It fouls the main sheet and the boom when furled on deck.
2. You have to carry fuel. I'm still considering building a vented locker in the aft deck to hold a fuel can.
3. It puts too much weight of the stern which you have to trim out with weight way up front.
4. It makes a noise and smells.
