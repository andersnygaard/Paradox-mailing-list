Hi Bert,

You are correct in that there is nothing keeping the yard to the mast except the halyard. This is a compromise so that when furled the sail can be laded alongside the cabin with out having to undo the parrel (it would be a long reach from the cabin). Look at your plans and note that the tack is made secure thru a brass pipe to the deck, this also acts like a swivel joint and holds the forward end from going over the side when furled. If you will go to the small boat files and look at the pictures in the Paradox Folder you will see Her sailing on Exuma Sound in 25 kts of wind with very little sail rolled up. Note how the yard stands away from the mast at the top. I agree that it's not very efficient but they are still sailing at 6 kts according to Chris Morejohn who was at the helm when the picture was taken. By the way Matt and Mindy Bolduc are sitting below during this outing.
The foot of the sail has a sleeve thru which the boom slides and is then made fast for and aft with ties.
Hope this helps.
