Subject: Re: Steel?

Steel 30-40% stronger than wood is what I've found for its weight. Also, like Bill has said about the advantages of steel, speed is a factor. Additionally, the finish is very fast: prime and paint. Spray on foam can be used to stop condensation, add buoyancy, and insulate. One drawback would be remote repair. Epoxy could patch it up until you can get to a welder; carry a few bolts and washers for a fast patch.
