I started drawing up your design in case I really do build one. Posted the drawing in your Gorfnik album. I'm not sure I got everything right yet (especially the cabin) but thought I'd share it and see what you think.

I'm trying to collect all the numbers and information from your posts and come up with the plans. Looks like another step or two to go on the main boat. I hope you also give us some information on the leeboard, rudder, sail, and how you control everything from inside.

One question, did you (or would you) consider extending the cabin a little further forward to add interior space? It just looks like there is extra room between the front of the cabin and the mast. I know it would add weight but is there a reason NOT to extend the cabin? Second drawing posted in same album.

Take your time posting the next steps though. Most build threads are spread out over a year or longer so yours is going pretty fast.
