I really like that design, saw it first in Annie Hill's book, Voyaging on a Small Income.  I found a used fiberglass sailboat somewhat like it although not a dory, a Tanzer 28, which is my keelboat.  But I would also like something for shallow water as well.  My boat is fast and seaworthy but not in 3' of water.
