Hello,

I've cut out bulkhead 3 (no others yet) and just noticed that it is supposed to have 5mm convex curvature on the sides. I see that bulkheads 1, 2, possibly the transom, but not 4, also have varying degrees of curvature.

Why do you think Matt specified that?

The slight curvature makes the side panels much stiffer, so they don't flex if you, or the dock, press against them.

No reason why you shouldn't put cleats on either side of b'hd 3 and fill the gap with epoxy. Then console yourself with the thought that the epoxy is stronger than the original ply so you have just made the boat stronger.

And, of course the added weight is not a problem, it just means you need to buy less lead.

If this is the last time you have to salvage a mistake with filled epoxy you are a better builder than me. :-)
