Subject: POLYESTER/EPOXY

Hello friends,

I'm building a Cachivache yard open as you may have seen in the photos. I want to impregnate wood and was thinking about using a hand of diluted polyester resin. Some people in these latitudes claim that I won't be able to laminate with epoxy resin on the layer of polyester after. Can someone advise me on this?

Thank you,
Alberto
