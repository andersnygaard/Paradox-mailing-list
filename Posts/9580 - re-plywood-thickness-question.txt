Subject: Re: Plywood thickness question

Dave, thanks for the link! I have used 9mm and 6mm for my puddle duck racer with 14 oz fiberglass on bottom and have dragged it across some serious rocks. I was surprised how well it stood up to the abuse. Link is very much appreciated because my first thought was to do 9mm bottom and 6mm sides as you say, just trying to find out if there are any disadvantages to that.
