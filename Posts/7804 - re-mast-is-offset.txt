Subject: Re: Mast is offset?

That is correct John. The mast drops down into and is seated within the vent box. That is what allows it drain overboard if water should come in through the mast partner area, without a drop entering the cabin. The vent box is set off-center, to the port side. The mast is dropped into the vent box as far to the right (starboard) side as it can be. Moving the mast on center would mean a complete re-design of this whole system. I seriously doubt that any performance increase obtained would be worth the trouble. The system as designed works very well and is extremely well thought out....a testament to Matt Layden's "outside the box" thinking capability.  I truly have not noticed much difference in sailing characteristics between port and starboard tacks....even with the sail on the burderned side and against the mast....in fact.....on Scout it almost seems that if either tack is favored,  port tack, where the sail is pushed up against the mast is slightly favored, however it is negligible and hardly worth mentioning.
