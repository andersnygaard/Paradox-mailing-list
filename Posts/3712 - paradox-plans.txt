Subject: Paradox Plans

Hello,

My name is Cary and I am a new member to the group, I am searching for plans of the Paradox, that I can buy. I did e-mail the couple in North Carolina but have not heard back from them yet. Has anyone read the manual for the construction of the Paradox and is it worth the money? Any information would be of help.

Thanks Cary.
