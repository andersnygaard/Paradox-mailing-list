Subject: Re: Time to build and cost?

Hi Steve,

Have you looked at Matt's Enigma sailboat?  Would that fit the bill
for you?  Since it is stitch and expoxy construction and doesn't have
the internal hull stringers and floors that Paradox does, I would
think Enigma would take much less time to build than Paradox,
expecially if you don't spend as much time on the exterior finish as
Matt did.  Of course Matt hasn't published the detailed plans for
Enigma yet, but his CAD drawings for the hull are available. Check out
the Enigma group here on Yahoo. I am working on a spreadsheet with
rough estimates of the time it may take to build each portion of
Enigma; but I may be way off, not having built a boat before. I'll
post the file when I'm done in the Enigma group. Just a thought.

All the best in whatever boat you finally decide to build.
