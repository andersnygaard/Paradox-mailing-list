One problem with Lexan that has not been mentioned so far is that it is ruined if you splash petrol over it.

Perhaps not relevent if only have the long sweep for auxiliary propulsion but to be kept in mind for those with outboard engines.

On my home built 23 footer  I used ordinary perspex and had no problems.
