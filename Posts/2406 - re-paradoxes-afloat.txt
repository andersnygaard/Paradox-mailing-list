Hi Dave,

Sorry to have forgot you.

Have you given the boat a name yet? I was calling mine So-So but it's been suggested that it's too much like SOS; now the wife has suggested Enuf! I confess that I quite like it.

Just fitted my transom and beginnings of the stem and she measures 4.21 metres with a bit more stem to add. As my woodworking skills are improving with practise I'm hopeful of extending the stem and not shortening the boat :0)

Best wishes,
Derek
