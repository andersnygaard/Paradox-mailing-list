Good tip.

When I was sailing close to shore this past summer I took the yuloh out to pole just to get an idea of how it would feel. It was calm day and the sail was up only to provide shade from the sun.

I was surprised that it was not a difficult task, and it did more the boat. My yuloh is slightly longer than the design and it worked well. I did prefer to practice the yuloh technique more so after a few pokes with the poling technique it was back to yulohing.

My first time poling was when I visited Andre in Canada, and he had us perform the poling in his gorfnik designs. Now I got a chance to do the same in the Paradox.

Side Note - I watched Andre pole his boat along the lake shoreline, and he got that boat moving at a very fast clip.

Side Note two -  No sailing at the moment, very cold and weather is turning worse.

Fairwinds,
Deric
