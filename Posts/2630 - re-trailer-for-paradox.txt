Hi Al

That's a good start. I'll either be towing with an elderly short wheel base Land Rover (poor brakes but slow speed) or a modern Vauxhall (high speed but excellent brakes).
Just an aside, but my Motorway patrolman friend tells me that that they only stop and check private trailers if they are flagrantly in breach of a law such as speeding.  Most commercial trailers can be expected to be overloaded or in poor condition so they have enough work checking those.
I find that quite comforting when I'm towing :0)
