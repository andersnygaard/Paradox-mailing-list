Subject: Safety your rudder or else
Date: Tue, 10 Jul 2007 17:26:03 -0400

I took Zoe out Sunday to try out the wind vane again and upon arriving at the boat ramp 50 miles later I found that the rudder up-haul line had come lose or was left lose in my rush to get some sailing in and the result was that I had lost about 15% of my rudder area. You can see the results at the bottom of the page here: http://ph.groups.yahoo.com/group/paradoxbuilders/photos/browse/2726?b=17&amp;m=t&amp;o=0 

I normally use the main sheet to safety the rudder for just this type of thing but had forgotten that as well.
Needless to say I was upset with myself but still determined to go sailing so I coated the bare end grain wood with some Marine Goop and launched.

Surprisingly I didn't notice much if any difference in the helm. The winds were 16 mph and gusting to 18.

More about how the sail went in a follow-up post.
