Like most of us, I have a severely limited budget. Before I begin cutting wood, I would like to know how much I am going to spend to get a paradox made with lumberyard materials, cheap epoxy and porch paint. Also, how much could I spend using marine plywood, west system epoxy and two part marine paint? State of the art Electronics and a new outboard.... 

My guesses are 2k for bare bones, and 12k for state of the art in USD$.
