I think I am going to need help from any and all the experienced (if you've done one from scratch, you've done more then me!) boatbuilders out there! (I did build a "stitch and goo" plywood lapstrake pram from a kit though.)

After reading microscruising and paradoxbuilders for a few weeks (also "smallboats", but i'm dumping them due to.... errr... low quality content <g>), reading about "The Aegre" adventure, having gotten tired of looking around for years and momentarily having enough money, I added up all the pluses and minuses of all the designs I liked/wanted/could afford and went and ordered some boat plans a few days ago... If any one is interested, take a look at http://www.golantgaffer.co.uk.

As it happens, they're not Paradox plans, but I hope that won't stop me from asking for and sharing information here and on microcruising and getting feedback. If paradoxbuilders isn't going to be an appropriate place, can anyone suggest other forums?

Going down (glug) for the third time,
