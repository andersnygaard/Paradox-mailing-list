Subject: Cedar Key and other things

Hi all,

I am new to the group. I have already purchased the plans - thanks Dave, and have a few questions. So here they are:

What is Cedar Keys? 

How do I get hold of Don Elliott's family to get the "Building manual?" 

And has anyone built the "bigger" version of the paradox?

Thanks,

Scott
