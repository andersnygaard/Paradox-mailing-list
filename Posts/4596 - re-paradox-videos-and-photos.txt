Bill,

What can I say? Brilliant!

Any idea of the windspeed on the first video? You seem to be going
at quite a lick.

The photo of "Faith" is superb, well done to Al.

From the state of the water I would guess there was a wind of 
between Force 2 and 3 Beaufort scale.

Paradox is an easily driven vessel and because she's heavy
displacement she carries her way. She has very little wetted area
and hence low drag and her narrow beam reduces resistence to forward
motion. Matt knew what he was doing when he designed her.
Incidentally, when the sail is balanced with the rudder, the latter
is almost neutral, being very slightly off centre with minimal
weather helm and drag. She also tracks exceptionally well.

Bill.

Notice, also, the lack of bow wave or wake in all the videos.

Hoping for calm nights

Al,      
Yeovil, England.
