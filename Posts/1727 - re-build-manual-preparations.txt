Good start. 

My only criticism is that if I had seen the tool list before I started building it may have put me off (all those extra tools to buy). At a rough estimate I have about one tenth of the tools on the list.

BUILD SITE.

Aside from considerations for the builder's physical comfort, this boat can be built where ever the builder chooses. Shelter for the boat and materials should be provided against dew, rain, and airborne debris, such as dust, pollen, spores, etc... This means that at the very least, a tarp strung up between trees could suffice. 

If the build site has no means of heating or cooling, this must be taken into consideration when purchasing materials such as epoxy, and paint products.

Optimally, a garage would be utilized, but this is not absolutely necessary. A dolly or rolling cradle may be employed for moving the boat around, as needed.

TOOLS.

Every builder will encounter different tools needs and preferences, due to experience, and tool availability. Some builders may wish to collect the finest quality tools, while others will make do with tools from the local hardware store. Some builders may wish to assemble a complete tool inventory prior to construction, while others will be satisfied to obtain tools as they are needed. Some builders may wish to construct an entire boat without using a single power tool (not recommended), while others will strive to use a powertool at every opportunity.
