Hi Jeff,

Sorry, I think it was Steve who asked the original question about (pedal) powering the boat from inside the cabin.

Pity you're so far away; I'd have asked you how much you want for one of them. MDs have intrigued me for a while.

Enjoy,

They said, get a life. I looked on TradeMe but I couldn't find one.

Sorry Jim, But I don't think that was me. I already know how NOLI will be powered.
As for having two MD's. I could always turn them into earrings : o or even cufflinks.
Cufflinks on a sweatshirt?

Hi Jeff,

I agree that the yuloh is probably a better idea but you did ask about powering the boat from inside. 8^)

Enjoy,
