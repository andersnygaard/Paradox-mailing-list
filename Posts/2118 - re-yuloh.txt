I go along with what others have said, when I laminated mine I put a 30mm block of wood on the garage floor, laid the wood over it and loaded the ends with weights till they touched the ground. The finished product seems to work ok.

Hi All, Im having trouble understanding the drawing for the Yuloh, maybe you guys can help. The problem is with the statement... For'd lower side laminate with 30mm longitudinal curve concave downword.. Im assuming this means there is a 30mm radius bent in it at the point described, Like a golf club or Hockey stick, How do you measure the 30mm curve ? I have made templates with a 30mm radius but do not know where to start or stop the bend ? anybody have any suggestion ? or better yet some close up photo's of that part of the Yuloh ?
 
Thanks
