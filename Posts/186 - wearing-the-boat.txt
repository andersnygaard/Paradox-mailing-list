Subject: Wearing the Boat

Its funny you mention that - wearing the boat. I was a little bored last night (nothing on TV, I admit) and made a mockup of the cabin on Paradox from some spare cardboard boxes and stuff lying around my place. I did this to get an idea of the size/utilisation. Now, I am 6 feet tall and weigh 210 pounds and I found the space fine. I tried a couple 'evolutions' i.e., simulating turning around, getting out of the sleeping bag, sitting down with knees against the side bins etc. Worked well. The only problem I could foresee was the headroom with the hatch closed - although my hair is very short!!! - I may need one or two more inches in height there....

Anyhow, can't wait to get back to my workshop (I live on base, my workshop is at my grandfathers place a while away - usually only get there on weekends) to start cutting out these bulkheads. 

Question - there is space on the plans outside of the water tanks, basically below the floorboards and the side bins (between BH 2 and BH 3) - is this where the lead pigs go and/or can you fit a smaller gel cell battery in here (one on each side) instead of a larger one in the storeroom?

Thanks guys,

Chris
