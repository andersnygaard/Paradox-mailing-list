Alastair, So do your filler lines go down through the pumps?

The only pipes I have to the tanks are the vents and the deck-mounted fillers, as shown on the plans. I have installed a submersible electric bilge pump into each ballast tank to empty them, and have a roving electric bilge pump to fill them.
