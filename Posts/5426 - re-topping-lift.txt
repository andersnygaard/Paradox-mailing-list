Subject: Re: Topping Lift


Steve,

Sounds great. I am sure you will be happy with the sail, and you can always add the topping lift after. Nice to have the choice, so thanks for all the work you did in getting the data into Sailrite.

I think it would be handy to have a topping lift if one is in port wanting to install a sunshade over the open hatch on a hot day, or sit out on the aft deck.

Maybe that idea won't work with Paradox though?
