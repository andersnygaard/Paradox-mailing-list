Isn't that tiller hole integral--along with the vent trunk--to ventilation?

Hi Guys,

I have had the same thing, not alot of water coming in from the rudder 
hole, so I fixed it, I took a piece of black EDPM rubber, roofing rubber, and made a nice flexible boot that is tie wrapped around the
rudder, and clamped to hull, it really does not need to be a completely watertight setup, it just deflects the water away rather than that shot of water that sometimes enters and explodes when it
hits the baffle, kind of like a boot you would see on a sports car shifter.

Even simpler is a disc of rubber on the tiller aft of the transom. this will allow air to pass through from inside but, when a wave 
slaps the back, will press up against the transom and act as a seal. 
A bit like the mushroom valve in your inflatable air tubes, but a 
much looser fit.
