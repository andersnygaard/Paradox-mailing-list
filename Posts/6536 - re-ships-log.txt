Well Al, I might be doing this wrong (and if I'm wrong, I don't want to be right), but I've been doing the drinking while tinkering with the boat; although not when power tools are in use.

To that matter and on a sad note, I'm on a unique diet program.  Long story short (well fairly short).  Each month I set a target weight for myself.  Each morning I weigh-in.  If below target, no problem.  If over target, I don't allow myself to drink alcoholic beverages of anytype that day.  Unfortunately, in two days we start a new month, and the target weight for July drops by 5lbs, projecting my ass (well, beer belly) to be 3lbs over target.  So tomorrow may be my last drink for a few days until some weight is lost.  Ironically my love for beer makes this a very effective diet.
