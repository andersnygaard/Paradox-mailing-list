Hi all,

Had a visit from a prospective builder today and the current state of Enuf didn't seem to put him off.

I showed him my copy of Sailing Just for Fun by Charles Stock and it got me thinking about books for Paradox sailors. I would like to offer the aforementioned along with Beachcruising by Douglas Alvord, Beachcruising and Coastal Camping by Little and Walsh and Pilotage by John Mellor.

What would you add?

Cheers,
Derek
