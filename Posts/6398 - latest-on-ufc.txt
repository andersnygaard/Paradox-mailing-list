Looks like the three leaders are all now at Fort Clinch at the mouth of the St. Marys R (NE corner of Florida). The two leaders were resting there and Wiz kept going. But he will have to rest now I expect. Or they all might take a break. Guess it was really a rough slog upwind most of the time.

Dave Bolduc aka Freebyrd in Matt's Enigma made this post, recounting what happened in the shorter EC.

"I was chasing him the whole time in his old boat Enigma, and I only managed to get within an hour and a half  of  him by the time I got to cp2. However, once he started paddling, I was left  quickly behind. Root, who was manning CP3, said Wizard was going so fast as he left Flamingo that it looked like he had a 2 hp outboard on the back of  Elusion. Believe me, he's going to get a ticket if he goes through a "no wake" zone going full speed!"

Having done a lot of paddling myself, I find this amazing since it doesn't look like Elusion is well set up for paddling and Matt at about 140 pounds doesn't look like a marathon paddler. So I had assumed he would be using a yuloh until I saw the photo Pelican took and Matt was using a long narrow straight paddle, not unlike the old-time voyagers used in their big canoes. But they  hardly ever paddled with less than about 8 paddlers.

No wonder they call him Wizard!
