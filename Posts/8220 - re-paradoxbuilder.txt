No Problem Craig, it's getting harder to avoid spam bots.

Thank you for your letter - it would seem that my email was hacked last night - malware posing as "what's app" made its way past Gmail's spam filter and started mailing out numerous emails to my contacts - I changed my pw - deleted the malware and tried to contact as many people as possible - then sent all the emails to spam and deleted them - I was up till 3 pm doing this. The hackers are still trying to break in but Gmail is putting a stop to it. I apologize for the headache - I wasn't aware this was going on until 11 pm.

Craig,
Check that your identity hasn't been stolen... I don't think you meant to send this post but it sure screwed up my computer... took me hours to repair.
