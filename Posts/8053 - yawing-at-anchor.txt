Subject: Yawing at Anchor
Date: 03 Nov 2014 01:13:19 -0800

Jim has just posted a story about a wild night in Worbarrow Bay June trip. 

I thought that I'd visit this bay before moving on to the Solent. It's an exposed anchorage for an overnight stay and only viable when the weather is calm. In Jim's post, which I have linked to twice for your convenience, he mentions bad yawing at anchor. This is not good news as that is one of the things I was hoping to avoid with my Paradox (we regularly get strong winds in NZ). 

Anybody else experienced bad yawing at anchor and solved the problem? Is this a ballast issue perhaps? Would keeping the rudder raised and hanging the yuloh right off the back of the boat help? I know from experience with my Michalak Philsboat that anchoring from the stern works, but the waves breaking against the transom give you no respite.

Cheers,

Rob

PS: My build is progressing. Currently working on the boarding step and hinged reefing rod. Trying to complete all the components I possibly can before being forced to go 3D.
