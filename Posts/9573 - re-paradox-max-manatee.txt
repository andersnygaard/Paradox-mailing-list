Subject: Re: Paradox Max (Manatee)

Hello,

I have attached pictures from the first part of my summer 2019 project for the Paradox Max (Manatee). I began by preparing the windows. The first step was to increase the pad for attaching the glasses. Then, I created a second step stencil and drilled big holes, which I refilled with epoxy. Additionally, I drilled holes for the toe rail and refilled them. There were many holes to drill! I also painted the inside white. Finally, I started constructing the vent trunk. Tomorrow, I will begin working on the second part of my summer 2019 project.

Best regards,

[Batejarcat]
