There is a lot of fitting and detail work to building a Paradox. It is not a 'slap together cheap sharpie' That said a Paradox could very well last the life of the owner. Matt Layden designed a superb boat. Just to mention if one wants just a bit bigger there is a document in the files section to stretch or enlarge Paradox slightly which was approved by Matt Layden.

Thanks guys. 

I have looked at the fafnir, but I like the almost no draft of the paradox for when sailing and wanting to beach on a sandy spot. THe Fafnir is definitely better for blue water cruising and looks easier to build.

Most of you say that the average building time for the paradox is 1000 hours, that sounds a lot for a boat of only 13'. Why is it so much?
