Subject: Re: Deck Carlins

I think Matt's later, more lightly built, boats have more structure to support very light decks. Perhaps your thinking of those photos that are on the web of Matt building lighter designs. I am building a compromise that includes some lighter scantlings and deck carlins are one of the additions I'm making.
