Al,
Your post about the sliding hatch runners reminded me of a worry I have sometimes had about the Paradox. It goes this way. The boat has had a crash of some sort and the boat is taking on too much water too quickly. The crash has also put a bind into the hatch slides and it won't open. How shall I break out? A hand ax? A big hammer to break thru the decking? Just where is the weakest spot? The polycarbonate plastic is emensly strong.
Am I the only one this idea? The miss-behaving slide can be very dangerous.
Good luck to everyone,
Steve Yahn
