A Bigger Paradox: Gunter in Germany is making (or has made) a 24' Paradox or 'Dox. There are lots of photos of his construction and idyllic locale. But Gunter got th'epox (epoxy rash). And that seems to have slowed things a bit. I remember Gunter writing early in the build that he believed that yes 24' was too big. And that's just the boat! I don't think he had considered what such an enlargement would imply regarding the sail. The sail would require a Max Shmeling in his prime (and his brother if he had one) to deal with it. Matt Leyden says 10% extra is okay. But reminds us the sail enlargement would punish anyone gaining the extra space.
