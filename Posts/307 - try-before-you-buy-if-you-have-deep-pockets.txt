8 days in the Bahamas on a Sea Pearl 21' cat ketch sharpie (open boat).
$1750/person double occupancy. Airfare extra.

I bet Dave and Mindy spent less on buying Little Cruiser and their first multi-month cruise there!

Still, there might be some interesting pics/information there about beach cruising in the Bahamas.
