Hello everyone,

I wanted to let you know that I have not started my build yet. I am waiting to retire next year before beginning. My plan is to use construction grade materials for the entire build. I am thinking that if I build it using these materials, I can always unbuild it if necessary and repair or upgrade it over time.

Best wishes to all,

Egan
