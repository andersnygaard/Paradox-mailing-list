Subject: Bigger Paradox

Hi my name is Chris, 

I am also from Germany. I will try to build a bigger (20%) Paradox in 2014.
I am on Expeditions for the last 25 years, so I know exactly what I need and that would be a little bit bigger Paradox, because I want to spend 4-9 month at a time in the boat...
I think Matt said 20 % bigger would be fine with his design...
Am I wrong???
