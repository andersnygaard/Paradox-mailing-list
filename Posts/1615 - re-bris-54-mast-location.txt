Bolger mentions such an arrangement in a couple of his designs. One of his even had the mast near the aft end of the boat with a jib-like sail running foreward.

I'm not much of a fan of this method of balancing forces because it would seem to me that the daggerboard and rudder would come out of the water at high angles of heel, particularly on a double ended boat. It might not matter on such a small, low rig and narrow boat. 

OTOH, the large rudder on Paradox certainly contributes to the lateral plane.
