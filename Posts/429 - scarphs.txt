Subject: Scarphs

As the weather is showing signs of warming up (though not drying up yet) I am preparing for the next burst of construction activity. I have cut out the side panels, and must now prepare them for scarphing.

The question:   Is there any reason why the scarph should be made one way rather than the other. That is, is it better to have the front panel on the outside or the inside, or does it not matter?

Waiting for enlightenment (or at least for it to stop raining),

Hoping for calm nights
