Hello Jim, 

I could not taste much the jib as this summer has been very stingy. What I have noticed is that I put a bowsprit to carry forward a little to not enriede with the mainsail. I've sailed with the jib alone and responds very well. I will keep you informed when making new evidence. And if you can tell me what are the little secrets of your new candle.

Best Regards, 
Alberto

Hello Alberto, 

My new sail was made here in the UK by a local sail-maker. Mainly, he followed the instructions given in the files section of the paradoxbuilders site, but being used to making unusual and 'traditional' sails he included a few of his own little tweeks here and there. 

BTW, There is a photo on the paradoxbuilders site of your boat with a a jib. Could you tell us how that worked out for you?

Best, 
Jim

Jim, you took the words out out my mouth:) 

Folks will spend hundreds on an outboard but use a tarp and expect the boat to sail like a champion:( 

I don't have a Paradox but love the little boat and will build one someday. I don't know how he deviated from Matts plans, but I'm building a Wharram catamaran right now and am shocked at the builder modes to his design. I know it's hard to stick to the plans but that's probably the best course.
