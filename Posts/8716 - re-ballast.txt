Hi Jim,

I'm about to leave one for a while to sail in better weather, a long way from home, is there any advice from your experience as to what to pack, repair equipment etc? I have plenty of space in my truck, that I'll be towing the boat with. Mostly day sailing, but some overnights...planned or otherwise...
I'm thinking to take resin and a few tools and spares for the outboard motor, (Honda 2.3 air cooled)
Any advice would be welcomed.

Nick
