Hi Glen,

The ply I have was sold as marine ply, although I notice that it is stamped AC exterior. It's 9mm 5 ply with to layers of hard wood, with the center and outside layers looking like your Paraply. I have been told by someone I know that the outside layers looked just like Kauri, but given that it is now illegal to cut down Kauri in New Zealand we thought that maybe it was Fijian Kauri. I wonder if your Paraply is related to the New Zealand and Fijian Kauri. The New Zealand Kauri is Agathis Australis. I think Agathis is the species and Australis is the sub species.

Hi Stuart,

The ply sitting on the screw nails is a piece of "Paraply" from South America, it's great for interior furniture but don't use it in boats as it will not withstand a boil test. The piece with the screw nails in it is exterior AC ply of 1/4 inch thickness. I just grabbed what was handy to illustrate the paint/glue board concept.
