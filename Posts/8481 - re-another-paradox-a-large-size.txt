Thanks Rob, and good to hear Mini is progressing well as well.

I didn't mention before, but when dry fitting bulkheads and sides, I never took it fully apart again. Just pressed the sides a bit apart, disassembled a bulkhead, adjusted the bevels and reinstalled with thickened epoxy. I found it easier that way...

Cheers,

Eerik
