I have also heard and seen the problems with keeping painted ACX from checking over time. Not sure if this is always true as there seems to be some variability in quality, as mentioned elsewhere. My opinion is that you will put SO much labor into the boat, that saving a few dollars on the materials is not worth it. I used BS 1088 grade marine ply on the Enigma 460 and haven't regretted it. I understand that this plywood is also lighter than ACX. 

I used West epoxy, since I have used it for almost 30 years. I like everything but the price, but might like another product if I tried it.
