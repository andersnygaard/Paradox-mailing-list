Hey Dave, the gang, all the builders and to-builders -- greetings!

I have much of the makings for a Paradox in my Tall Grass Prairie to-be boat shed after procrastinating for at least ten years. It's great to see the Para group still on line. I'm afraid the link to the other group is just that. I've been in a parking zone there awaiting approval to join the group for a while now. I don't think any administration is actually occurring there. It sure would be a sour note to lose all the knowledge orbiting there. Dave, any line of communication with the Misses and perhaps we could scoop up those posts to archive? I don't think there's anyone one home and it looks like the lights are due to go out pretty soon.

Again, much appreciation and delight in the musings and mastery here at the beloved Paradox site. Along the lines of alternatives and "shoulda, woulda, couldas" that rise in afterthought, anybody got some items they would have changed in the batting order, assembly, features, frolicsome ideas with 20/20 hindsight being as it is? I intend to pretty loyally follow the Elliott Building Plan as it see it now, but I'd love to hear about some of the gem stones of planning and parting in that my esteemed predecessors in plans and production came up with.

Great winds and gentle spring weathers to all and to all thanks in advance.
