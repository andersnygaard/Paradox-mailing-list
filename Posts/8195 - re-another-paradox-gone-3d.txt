Do you mean the very foremost compartment - the one immediately behind the stem ?
If so, yes it's not very easy to get to - unless you're very small and lithe, or a legless dwarf.  
I keep some empty polycarb fizzy drink bottles in there  and my pillow , so little weight .

Like Alastair says, you need a LED light in the forward stateroom  (2nd compartment ). Mines fixed to the bulkhead with velcro and is a cheap Chinese made thing which I'm frequently  having to fettle . These cheap LED lamps powered by AA cells suffer from poor connections and tend to work only sometimes....

I've made the access opening in the bulkhead slightly larger  and the cill lower - down to the level of the cabin floor , which helps me - a biggish old bloke, to reach through.and slide boxes through easily .  Also I can stick my feet through at  night.

I'd advise against making a hatch in the foredeck. When conditions are lively the foredeck gets quite wet and a hatch there would be sure to leak.

Best
