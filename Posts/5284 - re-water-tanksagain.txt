Either plastic tanks or bladders sound like a reasonable idea, if you can get them made the right shape cheaply enough. However there is nothing intrinsically wrong with the tanks as designed. I have had problems with my cheap inspection hatches not always sealing so allowing a little water into the bilges and, at the moment, am using fixed lead ballast in place of water. 

I have located a supply of hatches which claim to be air tight rather than just weather-proof and will be fitting these this winter so I can return to water ballast.

Hoping for calm nights
