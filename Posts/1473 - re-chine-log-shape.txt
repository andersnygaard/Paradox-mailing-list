If you look at the lines drawing no 2 you will see the outer corner angle is always greater than 90 degress to fit between the side panel and the bottom.  As Alastair has mentioned it's a matter of attaching the chine logs with the section shown constant.

When the bottom is fitted the chine logs will have to be shaped to allow the bottom to fit snugly.

I think that must be correct.
