Is there any way to make the mast light so it plugs into a socket and is removable? Maybe custom connections at the end with a screw socket or something. Also the lightning rod maybe could sleeve at the top and bolt down with a butterfly screw for quick removal. Just a Mcgyver thought.

Making a transom hatch modified with pot belly seems like a good thought. Glen and Bill How did your mast work out here as far as storing the mast completly inside while trailering. Steve Yahn
