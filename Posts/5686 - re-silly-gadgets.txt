Yes - there was one at the original link I posted.

But to me it is over the top expensive as is their portable power supply.

I paid $150 for mine on sale and it has a 300 watt inverter, light, radio, tire inflator and a USB connection.Similar to this one.

So I expect even their DC generators can be bought cheaper if one looks around.

Another advantage with going electric is that you can store your pedal power in advance to run the motor when docking and not be locked into the pedal mode at that time. Also as you mention you have the reverse, as well as the solar option.
