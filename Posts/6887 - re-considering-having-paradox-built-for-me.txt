Several builders have put a drop board in the back of the house so they can sit on the aft deck and dangle feet comfortably over the sill. I'd go for that myself, though many have argued it's too risky in a knockdown. If you want safety, I'd avoid any ventilation opening that would be likely to take water in a knockdown. The vent trunk is supposed to be good ventilation--maybe with an air scoop outside in hot weather. Maybe (just maybe) a small forward centerline hinged window?

After the loss of Zoe, I am considering having a paradox built for me. It's going to be pricey, but as these boats go for sale so infrequently I think if I really want one, that will be the best option.

So while I am thinking about it, I thought I'd run a few modification ideas by the group and ask if they had any other mods they'd make.

For example, if one wanted extreme safety (as I would on the Pacific Coast) would I be better off with a hinged hatch rather than a sliding hatch? Would that not be water tight?

Might two hatchs be installed (one forward as well) for two people to poke their head out? But then, what to do with the solar array?

I am big on air circulation. Might hinged side or front windows be useful?
