Non-breaking or non-braking?

Well, I ordered a new winch. It is a two speed 2500lbs load with a brake, which will replace my single non breaking winch.

I plan to replace the winch stand with a longer one 24 inches to 32 inches that will allow me to raise the winch to height of the cleats on the bow. The v block will be lower than the winch and rest the bow in place.

After the winch is set and the stand all sorted out, my next task is to lower the boat from trailer to the ground on small rollers, or a dolly with wheels.

Thank you,
Deric
