Subject: New use for Chine Runners

Recently I was spending a night out on my Paradox at anchor for the night. Around midnight I got up out of my sleeping bed and stood up for a look around. The water was very still and the sky very dark. Then I saw it. Bioluminesence. It is sometimes called red tide. This always happens in the warm summertime spurt of growth. When these microorganisims are agitated they give of a beautiful blue glow in the water. As I was anchored near the Tacoma narrows just south of Gig Harbor there was a good tidal current going by. When I lean over the side of the cabin and rock the boat side to side the chine runners churned up a fine whorl of glowing snowflakes which stream away aft. You really need to see it. Just Magic!
