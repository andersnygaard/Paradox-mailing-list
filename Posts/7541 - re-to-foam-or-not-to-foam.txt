Subject: Re: To foam or not to foam...

I think it's primarily about insulation. If I just day sail and an ocasional weekend in moderate temps then I wouldn't bother. But living aboard in temps where condensation will occur and I change my tune. It's amazing how much moisture our bodies emit. If the air or water hit the dew point temp then the fun starts, every surface is covered with dew.
Wintering over from Jax Fl north and I want insulation:) Summer in Maine and I want insulation:)
I always use the pink foam board from Home Depot.
