Hi Nels


The major obstruction might be the willows that may have grown up along the shoreline between the waters edge and the trow path. If these paths are not in active use, then there will be many many obstructions to negotiate around. Of course then you could use the yuloh.

On the Severn, and I'd guess, other English rivers with ancient navigation rights that is definitely a problem. Also, of course, it is difficult to find teams of rope haulers when you need them. Even back in the 17 and 1800's the authorities were trying to disband them because they drank to excess and bust up wherever they were. I've always felt a sneaking regard for them. When I used to drink to excess I rarely had the energy or coordination for fighting. I tended to fall over and go asleep. I've woken in some very peculiar places in my youth.



We have all of them over here!


Is this the aircooled? I've heard that tyhey are very noisy.



Boring! I thought Canada was the land of adventure Nels :0)
