Three Paradox's on the West Coast! We'll have to bring the flotilla together - that will be a first.

Glad to hear you're almost finished Rod. I thought you had moved out to Florida. Glad to hear you're back. How much further before you're finished? Where in LA? I'm down that way from time to time. Yep, I'm still in Sacramento but looking at moving back closer to the ocean before too long. 

Mark, shoot me an email at mwatersworld sometime. Did Zoe come with the self-steering gear Glen built? I finished my version in the workshop but haven't fitted it yet. I'd love to know how effective it is on Zoe when you get to that point.

Cheers,

Mark
