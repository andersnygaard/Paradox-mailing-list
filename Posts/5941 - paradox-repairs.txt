Hi all,

I took Little Jim out for a very pleasant weekend sail at the beginning of the month. Afterwards I was fiddling about with the trailer and noticed that the bottom of the rudder stock and step were quite badly scratched up, some of the scratches going down to the wood.The damage was much worse than on the bottom of the boat which has had little more than the paint scraped off.

Anyhow, I decided to take the rudder off and slap another layer of glass on the bottom. This would be the first time it had been off since launching in 2003. Imagine my surprise to find that the lower pintle (a 12mm diameter SS rod) was floating free in the rudder stock. Fortunately there appeared to be no damage.

I had originally rubbed the pintle down with emery paper and dropped it into the oversize hole with some epoxy. The epoxy squeezing out at the top indicating a lack of voids. Obviously merely roughening the surface with emery paper isn't good enough so after draining the water out, drying and cleaning out the hole, I made a few saw cuts in the side of the rod to make a better key and repeated the install process.

I will be checking this at the end of each season in future.

Other than that there have been no problems The installation of a bicycle (a Brompton <http://www.brompton.co.uk/>) has been a resounding success being out of the way up forward during sailing but giving much greater range of travel when at a destination. It also makes it much more practical to leave the boat and return for the car and trailer if the weather turns nasty. Being a folder it can easily be carried on a bus or train or in the boot of a car.

Hoping for calm nights
