Subject: Deck Carlins

Rookie question.

There are no carlins for the foredeck or aftdeck, just deck beams? The boat only has two deck carlins and they are for the sidedecks; correct???

I ask because I recall seeing build photos with more support for the deck than what I'm interpreting from the plan.

Hoping to receive some feedback from the more experienced builders.

Respectfully,
