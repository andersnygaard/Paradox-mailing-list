Subject: Re: Construction Questions- anchors

Thanks for the information Dave.
I reckon that I'm ok then. One of my anchors has 3 metres and the other 2 metres of 8mm 
chain and both have about 30metres of 8mm three strand nylon. 

I guess if I were outfitting my own Paradox now, I would probably just get a Danforth style anchor along with some sort of plow anchor for trickier bottoms.  Then, I would attach about 10 to 14 feet of 3/16" - 1/4" galvanized chain along with 100 feet of 3/8" dacron line to each one, and I would be good to go.
