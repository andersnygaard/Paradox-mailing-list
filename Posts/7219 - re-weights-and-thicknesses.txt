I built sailboats and larger plates with less thickness between 6mm and 9mm. I ask: is there a real need Paradox be built with slabs as thick or it could be lighter, with sheets of 9mm? If the text contains errors, this is due to google translator, because I write in Portuguese. I hope the question is understandable really excited about the project and I intend to build this Paradox microcruiser.

If you put less weight in the boat structure you will need to add more lead ballast. It is better to have the weight where it will do most good.
