One thing that struck me is how inflexible 18mm ply is!
I'd laid it down flat on a couple of blocks to keep it off the floor. 
When I stood in the middle (all 11 stones of me) it hardly bent at 
all. I can only imagine what a mammoth task it's going to be to get 
it to follow the bottom rocker.

I don't remember any particular problem. I started at the bow and 
nailed & glued my way to the stern. Once you get those ring nails in 
they hold it down. I did have my son sitting on the end of the ply to 
get the last bit nailed down.

Hoping for calm nights
