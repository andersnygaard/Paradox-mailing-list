Subject: Re: Ballast


I don't have an answer in numbers, but I do know that it is unlikely to suddenly become unstable if you remove too much ballast. when Derek Clark launched Enuf for the first time recently it was significantly underballasted, but the main symptom was an increase in the initial tenderness. There was still sufficient stiffness to sail in sheltered conditions. On 2 occasions I have forgotten to add the water ballast and on both occasions it was when moving on deck, not sailing, that I noticed the change in stiffness and realised what I had done.

So my advice is try taking all the ballast out and see what it is like. (wear a swimming costume)

Then report back.

Hi All,

I have been playing around with a "Power Paradox" for a while and need
some advice on ballasting "Paradox" under power alone. She is a very
stable boat under sail propery balasted, but what about under power?
what is the minimum ballast I will need to keep her stable?

Thanks
