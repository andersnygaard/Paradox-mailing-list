Subject: Re: Is Paradox suitable for the "vertically challenged"? ;o)

The Paradox is of course a very cool design and has a combination of features I'd love to have and have seen nowhere else (except maybe Yrvind 1/2). But one of the things that has given me (as a 6'2" 49-yr-old with a troublesome back) pause about building a Paradox is the inability to move around in one much. I can't exactly stroll around my 20-foot ketch, but at least it has a cockpit in which I can stand up and work the kinks out of my back in the morning. Now I'm trying to imagine staying aboard a Paradox without any way to stretch my legs or even stand up while at sea for weeks at a time. I know I wouldn't want to try it.

Hay Bert !

I just turned 60 ! I own a 26 foot modified sharpie of Glen-L design and I love being able to beach it which I have done many times!

The only reason I am looking at building is because I want to sail the Atlantic alone before I get too old to chance it. I love the Paradox too, but I need to carry stores and spares for 3 people a cat and a dog LOL  I got really intrigued when someone posted about making a 28 foot Paradox, but the more I look into it the more I doubt its feasibility. In the files section there is a file about larger paradox which they stretch to 16.5 feet.

If I could feel safe about crossing with my sharpie I would! It is not self righting past about 35 degrees and not self rescuing either like the paradox is. I know the folks at www.microcruising.com and they have had great luck with Matt Laydens boats.

Just so you know, I have thoroughly researched Bolgers designs too like the long micro and Martha Jane and his new AS-29 (but I like Jessie cooper best!) see http://www.boatdesign.com/tomboy/Cooper/Page.html as it was the ancestor of the later AS-29 designs.

I would still like to sail the Atlantic and coast of Africa with a large Paradox, but i am beginning to doubt it is possible to make one that large and retain all the sailing characteristics. It would end up turning into another boat anyway.

Kindest Regards,

Andrew

Wow, thanks for all the consideration. ... seems like other tall folks have worked on the sitting height question. I have looked at other designs as Swaggie. That's a great design BUT I'm really intrigued with the shallow draft and simple design of paradox. It may seem lazy of me, but at my age (65), patience and skill level, Paradox seems much more doable and exciting the way she goes to windward without a centerboard, etc. I've owned a west wight potter, shallow draft, flotation, lots of good qualities, .... but probably not as strong and sea worthy as a paradox.

I had to laugh at myself: i checked back and it seems I raised this same issue of head room a couple of years ago on this site....embarassing to say the least ;0)

I'm in Michigan, my daughter is in Minneapolis and I think I heard a paradox was on the west side of Wisconsin or near Minneapolis. ...obviously it would be best if I could visit one.... have auto, will travel if there is one available for viewing... Most of all thanks for your thoughts, REALLY appreciate them.
