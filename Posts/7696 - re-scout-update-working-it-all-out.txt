Sorry Sean, but those are not Regulations: they are someone's very brief (and therefore misleading) summary of the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea. The IRPCS (as the name suggests) are international and include the US! I suggest you take a look before you (metaphorically) run aground!

The 'black ball' of which I speak is not 'the steaming cone'; it's quite different, with a different purpose. I suggest you look up the IRPCS. The document I quoted is issued by the MCA: you'll find that the USCG issues an identical version!

'Tacking angle' is defined by the apparent wind and a compass. What you are doing is very useful to you, and helps you sail your boat, but it's not 'tacking angle'.

It was not my intention to 'pick at you' over the Regs: in your blog you have mis-quoted, or mis-read (or not read at all) the IRPCS, and I sought to save you a little money on unnecessary lights. If you ever sail in Dutch or Portuguese waters without both cone and ball they'll 'pick at you' to the extent of impounding your boat!

Best wishes,

John
