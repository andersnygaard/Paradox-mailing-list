That sounds like a good plan. It will certainly be much easier to clamp them in position and if you steam them first it will make it even easier.

As you know, I found it impossible to bend the full length pieces into position and ended up cutting them into ~1ft lengths. This appears to have worked ok, but full length strips would be more elegant, not to mention needing less epoxy.

Go for it!
