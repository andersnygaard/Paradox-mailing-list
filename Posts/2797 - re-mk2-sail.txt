Hi Jack

Checked my sails (made by Jeckylls) and if they are taped it is inside a fold of the material and 25mm wide.
Both Luff and Leech are about the same width and thickness but the one is sewn with two rows of parallel zig zag stitching and the other with straight stitching.
I am assuming that the tape is in there because the sailmaker had a copy of the file from Matt and they are a reputable firm. Not that I believe that means a lot nowadays.
