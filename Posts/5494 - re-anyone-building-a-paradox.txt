I estimate that on my 3 week cruise I used about one third of the available storage space, that is, if I had packed it neatly I reckon I could have fitted in at least 3 times as much as I took. Having said that, quite a lot of what I took was there because it MIGHT be useful. Lots of it wasn't used.

This is one of the great things about Paradox, you can take all those useful things and there is no problem with weight as you just leave out some of the lead to compensate.

For weekend trips I routinely carry tinned food for a week, several sets of dry clothes, a large battery, 3 anchors with chain, 4 fenders, a full toolbox, a similar box of useful spares and now a bicycle. It all just disappears into the various storage areas.

Hoping for calm nights,
