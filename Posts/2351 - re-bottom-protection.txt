I like the idea of uhmw plastic on the bottom of a boat that will be beached regularly.  How thick of a piece of uhmw plastic are we talking about?

Thanks,

Hi Phil,

   A friend of mine has an Air Boat that has the same thing on the bottom, its tuff stuff. It will take a lot of screws thru the bottom to install though.

I am wondering about the feasibility of doing the same thing as is done to the bottom of the McKenzie River drift boats if deliberate grounding is planned. They put a sheet of uhmw plastic or nylon on the bottom. I am not exactly sure what it is called but it is a kind of industrial grade material that is also used as bearings, rollers, and anti chafe gear in industry. The drift boat guys swear by it.
The navy uses it to pad the flight deck in the areas where the tail hook strikes the deck to eliminate  damaging the hook or the steel in the deck. It can really take a beating.
