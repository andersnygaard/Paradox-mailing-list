Subject: 12 volt wiring

Hi All,

I'm in the process of re-wiring my Paradox Whisper and am curious as to what type and gauge of wiring everybody else has used? I have all LED lighting, a few aux. plugs, and a GPS (handheld). I have industrial-grade 10 and 16 gauge that we use at work. Any thoughts?

Thanks,

David
