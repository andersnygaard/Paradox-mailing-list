Subject: Mast Pin?

In Don's articles it says that you can pull out a pin and lower the mast. After looking at construction photos it seems that most people aren't including this pin? Is this correct? And the mast tilts forward or back? 

(As a side note what I was referring to as canted masts before is really raked masts)
