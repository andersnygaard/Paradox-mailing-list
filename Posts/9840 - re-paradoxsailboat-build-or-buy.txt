All up I spent 7000 on it
I had a special mast made, a very light one, for my ageing old muscles to lift easily
The trailer was a converted jet ski trailer, cost 900 dollars
 The build was six years ago
Yes, Australian dollars
I also used all marine ply and the best products 
Build took eight months, I’m retired so I dedicated a lot of my time to it 
It does all it says it does
It’s a bit shy upwind in rough water, best to anchor on days where the wind won’t cooperate and the water is rough
It’s been tipped over and indeed it rights itself, rather suddenly too
Stick to the plan
You'll love it
