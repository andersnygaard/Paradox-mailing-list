Subject: Re: Mainsheet and outboard

Thanks for the pictures Dave.

As Al points out the boom is longer on a Paradox, but surely the mainsheet can be brought into the top of the rear deck and still clear a motor? Perhaps I'll see better when I have the mast in position.

I appreciate Jeff's comments although I confess that I don't understand the technicalities, but one thing is for sure; the outboard is essential.

Living 150 or so miles inland I am ideally placed for access to the sea in an arc from the Mersey anticlockwise to the Wash. I particularly want to use the rivers and the obvious access to those is via the canal system which centres neatly on the Midlands. I don't see yulohing the Staffs and Worcs or Shroppy as being very practical :0
It'll be hard enough outrunning the hordes of kid with a motor! 

Thanks for all the help  ........  Derek
