Subject: Re: Bill Sergeants web site

Yes, I have a copy of the Paradox site. Bill said it was OK to take a copy for personal use. Some of the info could be posted somewhere else, in fact I'd be happy to host the owner info etc. on my site. I'd have to check with Bill first however as this is still his data.
