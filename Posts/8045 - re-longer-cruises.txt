Hi Jim,

I've wondered several times about salt on the windows. This was a real problem on my Philsboat. For my Paradox I was going to use clear Perspex, since I felt that tinted Perspex made the problem worse.

I guess the bonus with a Paradox, is that the side and back windows can be easily cleaned while underway. Not sure about the front window.

Cheers,

Rob.
