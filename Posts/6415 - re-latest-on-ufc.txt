Seems Whitecaps is maintaining a furious pace and may be only about 5 miles from the portage at 1 PM spot time. MC is not far behind. Wiz is maybe 20-25 mile back now, but has picked up his pace.

Crazy is just entering the bay at the mouth of the St. Marys.

Nels,

I haven't done a lot of looking but the "Show only current waypoints" on the Mapper shows these two "check points" which is the beginning and end of the 40 mile portage.

"UF Stage 4 Traders Hill CP, Mile 770
Traders Hill on the St. Marys River, GA.
Challengers in classes 4, 5, and 6 may switch to a kayak or canoe for the upper river sections and long portage."

The end of the portage....
"UF Stage 4 Fargo CP, Mile 840
Enter the Suwannee River at Fargo, GA."

You now know everything I do.  The trip down the Suwannee will be much faster with the current.

John,

Does the portage begin at St. George and go up route 94 to Fargo GA - where they put in on the Suwanee River? If so the two leaders, Whitecaps and Manitou might make it to the portage before the day is out. Kind of fun to zoom right in and see where they are. You can see some of the fallen trees in the water. Lots of white sand and some really big oxbows in the river. You can see at one place where the river almost rejoins itself and there is a path right across, which cuts off about 1/2 mile of paddling. Then there are some dead ends if you take the wrong fork.

WC has recently forged ahead of MC by about 3/4 of a mile at 11 AM EDT. Matt has fallen back quite a lot and is going about 1 knot slower on average. Hard to guess how far back as the river is so crooked.

Crazy Russian is just about at the mouth of the St. Mary's river. I understand he may be carrying a folding bike as is Pelican. If the bikes work as planned they can do the 40 mile portage in maybe 4-6 hours compared to the better part of 2 days walking the boats over. Will also be interesting to see how the mirage drive does speed-wise on the river.
