Ive looked into the hardening problem, not knowing what exatcly is the makeup of the bronze, ie tin content copper and phosphorus, we cannot say exactly.  if you can find out from where you got the bronze, we can then find out its properties. 

I did ask, of course didn't make a note. But it should suite my purpose when bending tiny scrap-parts, it does not give the impression to be brittle, it can be bent however much. It's just that 2mm thickness is very thick.

It may be that the radius is so when beached we dont void the edge and expose bare wood, we know what happens then, and all you will get in the end will be a curved edge anyway, and since you have bronze, epoxy and divinycell, there is no wood to rot out. paint is cheap and well, its a paradox, not a ocean liner, easy to outhaul and inspect, repair. That's what I hope.

Have you already attached it to the boat?
