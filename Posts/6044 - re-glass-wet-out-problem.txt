Hello Pete

I didn't mention that I used a foam roller to applied the epoxy resin and I use a squeegee to smooth it out on the first coat. I rolled out the next three coats and back brushed it with a foam brush. Making sure to scrape the bubbles out of the foam brush often!! I had great results. -Wayne

OK, so today I glassed one side of my Paradox. I reckoned this would be a straight forward job. So far I've glassed the bottom using 600g and 450g biax and have 120g cloth on the deck. All these were a breeze to apply so you can imagine my dismay when I had real difficulty wetting out the 200g cloth on the topsides. I had to apply a massive amount of pressure with a squegee (sore wrist now) to get any transparency of the cloth. In 2 or 3 places I could not get it to go transparent at all. The cloth is not floating, it's saturated with epoxy but will not go clear. My dilema is now what to do. Shall I try and cut out the white areas and try again? Is it possible there is something wrong with the cloth? I bought it from Robbins so should be epoxy compatible. I'm now not looking forward to side number 2!
