Subject: Re: Enigma 460

Being as knowledgeable as the next member, I thought I would put my oar(yuloh) in but I may be wrong : -(
But on re-reading Matt's article on ENIGMA's build he says
'Both sides come out of the resulting 4' x 12.5' (12'-6"?)sheet.'  Out of one and one half sheets?
If this is so, that would only leave's 3" to take up the curve of the boats side, which for a beam of 3'-3" is just about do-able.
This would mean that ENIGMA's hull length must be around 12'-3".
But I think that for the average group member the beam at 3'-3" would be a bit on the narrow side and increasing it to 3'-6" would give a greater degree of comfort for big butt members ;-)
Remember that Matt designed ENIGMA to his size, height and weight.
Increasing the draught to 7" would take up some of the extra weight needed for a larger crew and displacement to about 700 lbs and an increase in sail area to 60 sq ft.
Should be still car top-able.
But don't take my word for it.
