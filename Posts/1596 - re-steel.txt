Subject: Re: Steel?

That has not been my personal experience with Phil Bolger. He can get 
very upset when people make changes to his designs, including the 
scantlings, although he doesn't mind a bit heavier or extra 
floatation. 

He offers free follow-up advice with all the plans he sells. If you 
start to go off from the plans he refuses any further support. 
(Unless the changes are an obvious improvement, in which case he will 
shower you with praise:-)

A faxed him about his steel design (COL H.G. HASLER) and he is 
considering re-doing the plans for plywood but not at the present 
time as he is swamped with work. He is very disappointed that nobody 
has built it in steel so far - since he put a lot of extensive work 
into it.

He and his engineer wife feel it is a breakthrough design for a 
single-handed circumnavigator.
