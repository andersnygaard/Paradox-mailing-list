Nels,

I think everyone should live up to a reasonable level of civility. 30 years ago I was amazed and disappointed that Jon MacEnroe used to get away with juvenile antics on the tennis courts and become more popular as he did so. I expect Don, myself, and others to be reasonably civil. I understand what Andy did and support his view that unreasonable posters should be banned. I simply think that it ought to start from "last warning to all" on. As far as what Don may or may not have done on other boards, I don't know.

I've always found on the groups I'm on that having many points of view increases everyone's knowledge. Disagreement is good, personally perjorative comments are not. The fact that we all think highly of the Paradox design shows that we all have some measure of good taste and discernment. I'd rather focus on our commonalities as would most of us here. I'm just saying let's start again. It's Andy's call and I will respect whatever decision he makes. It's his "house", he's the host, and I'm his guest.
