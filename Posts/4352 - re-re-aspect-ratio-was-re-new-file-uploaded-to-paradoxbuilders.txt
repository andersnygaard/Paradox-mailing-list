Ray,

I like the arch idea too. It is one of the things I've considred. It would also be out of the way of the rudder when drawn into the UP position. I installed a mast gallows on my West Wight Potter "Bobber" and used stainless pipe set into stainless base receivers used for lifelines on larger boats. It has held up very well, and I agree that the stresses should be manageable with the junk sail.
