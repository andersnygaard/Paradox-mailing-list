Great story and photo too, Nick. Thanks. You seem to have got away without too much bother with your capsize (accidental ones are way freakier than deliberate ones, eh?).  A friend of mine has a Scamp which he accidentally capsized recently.  All of his treasures floated away and the centerboard jammed up in its slot.  He had to hold onto the boat and wait until he was blown into shallow water.

Cheers,

Rob.
