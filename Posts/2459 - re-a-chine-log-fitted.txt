Hi Derek, 

Congrats on the chine log installs! I am unable off-hand to find the details concerning the joint you mention and I have not personally tried it, but intend to use it myself on the next boat. 

I am not sure if you have to use nails at all and I certainly would not use ring nails. More likely wire nails or something that can be removed or clenched over. You don't want any extra pressure that might squeeze out the epoxy and starve the joint. I think I would cover the joint with a strip of glass about 4 inches wide on the opposite side to the 1/4" ply, and have that inside the hull. The 1/4" filler ply side would then be completely covered by the bottom glass. No mechanical fasteners at all. That would make it stronger than the rest of the bottom!

I will try to find out if there are any other tips that might help. The wonderful thing about this joint is that it is self-aligning if measured out carefully. I expect the routered out section should be just slightly wider than the filler strip and the epoxy will fill the gap. Does that make sense?

The other option is to use a wider strip of glass if you want the double joint inside the hull.

Cheers, Nels
