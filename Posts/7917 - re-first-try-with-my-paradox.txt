Subject: Re: First try with my Paradox

Thanks for the advice Pete, well noted. Cyclist gloves seem to work well, although I have fairly tough working hands and did without today. But I'm sure I will appreciate them when the winds come up.

Two or three turns on the furling drum before starting. Yes. I had learned that lesson too last time!
