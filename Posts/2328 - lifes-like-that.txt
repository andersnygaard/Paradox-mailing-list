Hi All.

It's been one of those years.

This year I had planed to start building my "PARADOX" type. I have all the materials, epoxy and fastenings for building the hull and deck structure.

At the begining of the year my neighbour asked if I would mind if some builders errected scaffolding in the passage between our houses to gain access for putting on a new roof. Muggins said yes. The scaffolding was to be up for about 5 - 6 weeks starting April.

May came and the scaffolding went up, the only trouble was a post put right outside my door to the basement. I could not get my sheets of ply out and around this ******* scaffold post.

Mid september, the ******* scaffolding finally came down after various delays including 3 weeks just to take the blasted things down. Next day, get the sheets of ply outside and mark 2 sheets out and cut them out. Down comes the rain. As I only have a lean too to work under I have to stop. ****. The weather seems to go on like this for the next few weeks.

All the panels are now cut out along with the frames(8). The weather is to cold now to start using epoxy, so I will have to wait now till next year. ****

Thats life.

Still I have had an email from the following company so I thought it might be of some interest to you all.

Chin up chaps(and chappesses). Summer will soon be around again. Will next year be one of those years again?
