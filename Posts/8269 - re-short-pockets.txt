How does the old saw run?

"If you need to ask the price,  you can't afford it."

Seriously though,
12K for electronics?  A joke question,  surely?
My GPS cost less than =C2=A3100.  My hand-held VHF cost less than =C2=A380.   My compass was a Christmas present.   Charts are essential,  of course.   My nav light (IRPCS compliant) is a converted garden solar lamp,  which doubles as an anchor light.

Where on Earth are you planning to sail your boat?

Best wishes,

John
