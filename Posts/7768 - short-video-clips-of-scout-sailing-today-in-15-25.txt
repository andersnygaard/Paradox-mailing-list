Subject: Short video clips of Scout sailing today in 15-25

great sail today. Some Friends were sailing nearby in a San Juan 23. They gave me some phone video they captured of Scout in probably 15-17...  They were much faster than me upwind....downwind I was hitting in the low 6's occasionally with a good windchop pushing me and the barndoor out. Could almost keep up with them.  

Experimented using more canvas to keep the speed up to about 3 knots upwind to punch through the chop. Not pointing as high but moving much much better and making most tacks on first attempt even in the higher breezes. A couple I stalled out on and assisted with a paddle stroke or two to push around....but only during the gusts that were topping 25. 

This boat is truly amazing. Toe rail in the water is not an issue whatsoever...ease the sheet and she stands right back up. Downwind she flies. It was cold outside....I was warm enough  that I ended up aiming the vent into the wind to get some air inside. The guys on the San Juan were amazed.  I am amazed every time I sail her in challenging conditions. It's like a bumble bee.....it shouldn't fly.....but it does!
