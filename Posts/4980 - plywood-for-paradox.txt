Subject: Plywood for paradox

I have discovered that an old friend of mine has a pallet of 2500 x 1220 x 9mm marine plywood that he bought many moons ago for a farm related project are surplus to requirements and may become available at a very reasonable cost.

As I will be building on a very tight budget, the availability of as many sheets as I need may be too good to miss.

The plans call for 4 sheets of 12mm ply for the sides and various bulkheads while the bottom and bulkhead 3 are cut from 18mm ply.

I would welcome the thoughts of the group as to my idea of using 9mm ply for the sides and deck and increasing the thickness of all the original 9mm bulkheads to 18mm and laminating the bottom from two layers of 9mm plywood.

I appreciate your advice

Regards

Greg
