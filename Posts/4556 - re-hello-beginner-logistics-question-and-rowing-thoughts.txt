Subject: Re: Hello, beginner logistics question and rowing thoughts

Actually, I was thinking of a human powered generator as the backup. My primary thinking was that a battery would be for lights and small electronics and very occasional electric motor use, but I was completely out of touch with the numbers. I did not realize that the "chargers" I was looking at are only intended to keep batteries from going dead when they don't get used for an extended period of time. As you and Alastair politely pointed out, my idea is not practical. I need to think more on the yuloh.

Thanks!
