Measuring from sheet #3 the max with of the foredeck is 3' 11" add a little for the deck crown and you probably are going to go over 4'. Thinking back now I do believe I scabbed in piece on each side to get all the way out to the edge of the gunnels. Hope this helps.

The side decks span from the gunwale to the carlines, the end pieces span between the carlines. The two side decks and the end pieces are supposed to come out of a 4ft width of ply but the distance between the gunwales is more than 4ft. Unless I have misread something there is no way it fits. Did you cut your panels from the ply as shown in the plans? It is only 2 of the 6 end pieces that are affected so I think I may get away with a joint in one piece at each end.

As I recall there was no problem with the side decks because the end pieces are not four feet wide at their widest. as for the mast I epoxied a piece of leather around the mast in the way of the partners to keep the mast quite and it has worked well. Tailwinds Glen
