Hello Rob

The situation is as Al describes it.  No one else going to using the slipway until the water returns.  At that boatyard one does have to pay to use the slipway and park the car and trailer there for the days while I'm away. 

There is a security system, so one can only access the slipway and storage areas while the staff are there (during working hours).  Often that means getting to the slipway while the tide is out, unloading the boat, then parking the car and trailer in a secure compound. By the time the boat floats on the rising tide, the staff have gone home and there is no one else there and no way to get a vehicle in or out of the yard.

Best,
Jim
