Subject: Re: Electronic tiller pilot

Thanks Glenn for your response.

I've more questions, if you don't mind me asking.:-

How did the tiller pilot compare with the windvane steering gear that you made?
How did you produce the electricity to keep it going without  depleting the battery?
Did you only use it for brief periods - or for many hours at a time?
Was it always able to cope with sailing downwind in big seas?

Sorry to have so many questions for you but I'm seriously thinking of buying either the Simrad or the Raymarine and would like to find out the most about this that I can before spending a fair amount of money.

Best
