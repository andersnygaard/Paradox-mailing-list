Ernie,

Actually I bought Whisper and fixed her up. I am building one Though, This is my fist boat and I have very little building experience. I have sleep aboard Whisper many times and think the modification were talking about would be a simple one, as for raising the cabin top, I don't know. Maybe another member could shed some light on this matter?

David,

Thanks for the offer to take measurements. It appears you've done a 
little customizing on your boat. I would definitely appreciate that 
kind of help since I'll be going "off the chart" somewhat. Always 
willing to take advantage of someone else's hard work and experience!

By the way, I'm in Sebastopol, California, which is west of Santa 
Rosa, and just east of Bodega Bay and the Pacific. I'm an hour north 
of the San Francisco Bay. If anyone is planning on being in the 
area, I'd love to hear your advice about any of my building projects. 
I learn a lot that way.

Thanks,

Ernie
