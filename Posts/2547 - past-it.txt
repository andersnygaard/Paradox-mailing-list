Subject: past it ??

I am interested in building a paradox, however at 63 years of age am I being overambitious, not in the building of it as I have quite a bit of boatbuilding experience but in the handling and sailing. Also, has anyone tried using an outboard as an auxiliary? I would appreciate some brutally frank feedback.
