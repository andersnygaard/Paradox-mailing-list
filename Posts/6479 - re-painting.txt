Hello Alexander,

I used single pack enamel for the interior because it is easy to apply. Outside, including the bottom, I used a high gloss two pack. Application of the paint with brush and roller is easy, but surface preparation is critical if you want it to look any good. Sand and fill until you can't stand it anymore, then do more sanding and filling. I used a single pack non-skid deck paint. It doesn't work and is stupidly slippery as soon as it gets wet. I suggest trying something coarse. My mast is clear finished with cheap varnish which lasts pretty well since the boat is under cover when not in use. I'm happy with everything except the deck paint, though two pack top coats are not for the budget minded.

Cheers,
Geoff.
