Subject: Re: Paradox windvane steering

This is the problem with setting up a windvane self-steering system on Paradox. There are several suitable lightweight vane gears, but how to set them up without interfering with the mainsheet is the difficulty.

By the way, I've already posted a few pictures on another forum and our own website, but I should have fresh ones to post here when I download my wife's camera tonight.

I've seen your photos on the microcruising group,(thanks) but they were taken a fair way from 'Zoe' which meant that details of the winvane could not be seen.
 
For those of you who haven't seen Glen's wonderful sharpie, she truly is a work of art. Luckily, we arrived a few days before the event started so we got to sail and cruise in his company. Hopefully, next year we'll get to see a few more of you in your own Paradox micro-cruisers.

I'd love to be there in 'Faith', but sailing the Atlantic to get there - I would have to think about that one!

Thanks Dave.

Bill.
