Why the sand Bill? I dont understand how sand can keep sheet lead in place??????????

If you had lead, then the lead could be just screwed to the bottom couldn't it? Then there would be a gain of space for.........for storing drinking water in plastic bottles. Much more wholesome than having it lurking in a plywood box.

Jim, if you are going along that line, you could use sheet lead with epoxy and sand to keep it put. Make sure the sand is hot dried, then allowed to cool, before mixing in the epoxy. Hot drying the sand removes any moisture.

I'm still considering using the tanks for their original design purpose, that's for a fresh water supply.

No final decision yet made.

Bill.
