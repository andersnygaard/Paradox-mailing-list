Subject: simplified furling system?
Date: Thu, 25 Oct 2012 01:34:29 -0000

Hi everyone,

I was researching how people had made their tack strop and how to bend the curved piece, and I noticed Tony Bigras' "Miss Cindy" has a system claimed to be similar to Paradox. However, it has fore and aft topping lifts and only a short line in place of the tack strop. Some of you also have fore and aft topping lifts. My question is: is the metallic tack strop needed in such a case?

Tony has also eliminated the curved piece and simply uses a strap, similar to the way some of you attached furling straps to the aft topping lift at the end of the boom. I'm just wondering if Tony's system is an alternative to the Paradox method or if it adds complications because it's not so easy to drop the boom on deck to get the mast down. Or are there other configuration changes to his sail setup that he made to get his system to work?

Not that I want to change anything, but I'm just curious.

Here are some links to pictures of his setup:
