Subject: Bending ply

Bending the forward part of the foredeck can be done by using leverage from 'wings' left when shaping either side, but you may get a small crack up the centre line for about 9" as I did with 'Faith's' deck.

Hindsight is a wonderful thing - I haven't left any "wings" for leverage!

If you do the proposed saw line it will make a ridge clearly visible because the pieces either side will straighten themselves. Structurally, I don't think it will matter, particularly as the deck will be glassed, but visually I don't think it will look as pleasing as the continuous curve Matt intended.

I haven't given in yet. Part of my problem is that the stem is a few mms too high still. When I sight along the deck it has a Turkish slipper appearance. I can feel a bit more grinding coming on.....
