Subject: Re: Yard Part Build for Paradox

I was wondering about the different types of material you may have used to build the yard.

The wood of choice is DF correct? I thought others decided on a denser wood and commented that the denser wood made the yard heavy; others have used aluminum? -- or at least experimented with aluminum.

Have most builders used DF for the yard?

I used DF and have no complaints. Still going strong after 13 years.
