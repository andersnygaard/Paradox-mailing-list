Hi all,

Got the sides sheathed in fibre glass today. Prepared over the preceding days it took 2 hours 
each side to wet lay up the sheathing.

Hoping to turn it over to do the bottom tomorrow afternoon because a neighbour has offered 
himself and his son for turning duty. I would have liked to have left it for 48 hours but the 
Severn Boat festival starts on Friday and the neighbour goes on holiday Saturday.

Cheers,
Derek
