Hi Al,

No!  But I have some honest to goodness very true fantastic fishing stories that are not pertinent to this site ....

So much better for the rudder! At a 45 degrees from bow angle of attack, the brute force of a breaking wave strike is like a broadside on a snowplow; Paradox's feeble flair combined to the "fence" of its chine runner is offering direct resistance to the force of the sea, with the damage potential of all this, since the bridle is maintaining it at that angle ... The stern rig series sea drogue works on the boat's strong defensive points: Do not fight/resist the beast; Lift your but up and aquaplane at a reverse slower speed than the passing breaking wave and avoid capsize... - Has anyone experienced the bow/broadside parachute sea anchor approach with a chine runner sharpie of similar beam to length ratio as Paradox ? - Would modifying the angle of attack by using the tiller/rudder be easy when the sea anchor is fixed in a 45 degree angle position by a bow-cleak/stern-cleak bridle ?

The USCG report contains numbers for reference for rigging ...

Wonderful! Be nice! and share with us unlearned silly fellows, pretty please!

Cheers, Robert
