Subject: Re: Gluing the scarph joint

I appreciate the feedback.

These tips and links will also help me on my next scarph joints, which should go a little faster. The first one was done using just a box plane. Well it trained me on the box plane. The next one, I'm considering making a series of crosscuts with a circular saw to clear out the bulk of the wood prior to using the box plane.

This group is very helpful. I also appreciate the websites that have been setup by other paradox builders. Considering how helpful those sites are towards my build, I suspect I might do the same for the next builder.
