Subject: Anyone need set of plans? My set for sell.

I've decided to buy a used boat before I dedicate myself to
building one myself. So, if anyone is still having problems
finding a set of Paradox plans, I am selling mine as a package,
along with my copy of Don's book.

$52 for both plan set (with the bonus CD)_ and Don's Paradox
book/build manual.
