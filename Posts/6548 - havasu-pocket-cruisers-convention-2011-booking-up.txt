Subject: Havasu Pocket Cruisers Convention 2011 - Booking up!

The website for the Havasu Pocket Cruisers Convention is live now at www.sailhavasu.com. 

If you are not familiar with the event, you can click on the link and watch a 10 minute video covering last year's event. 

We are still 6 months out and already 40 boats and crews from 7 Western Sates and Canada have signed up. This year promises to be our biggest and best yet with a spectacular set of seminars scheduled, lots of fun events, in the water boat show, some great sailing, and more, still to be announced. But even better than anything WE have planned ...are the folks that attend the event. If you come here you will make friends from all over the country and spend a week you will never forget enjoying their company. 

The website is updated daily (except for the days I am at work!) with a list of who's attending, where they are from, and what boats they are bringing, A list and description of the seminars that will be offered, and general event info. 

Dates this year are Feb 14th through the 21st, 2011. 

Location is Lake Havasu City, AZ 

We had 70 boats last year....our goal this year? 100+ boats! 

Come on and plan on getting that trailer sailor out of the snow this winter. Come meet one of the most diverse and friendly groups you could ever imagine. Join in for a fun-filled week, right in the middle of winter, sailing the beautiful waters of Lake Havasu. Help us "Fulfill the Dream!" 

Hope to see you here!
