I installed a screw-in deck plate on the upper washboard of my last cruising boat's companionway, for visibility aft when below.

As to the angled washboards, it's true that they come out more easily than straight-sided boards, but that's a feature, not a bug.  When I installed a heavy U-bolt under the companionway for attaching safety harnesses to, I used the part of the bolts that projected into the cabin to mount a wood cleat.  My weatherboards were reinforced with strips of timber on the inside, and I attached a line to the upper board.  In heavy weather, I put the boards in, and cleated the line tight, so that the boards could not lift.  It was less convenient, but safer.
