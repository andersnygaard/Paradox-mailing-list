Hi,

I'm new to this group and I live in Utah, U.S.A. I have received the plans to build the Paradox. After looking over the plans, I was able to interpret all except on sheet #12 the Mast detail/description.

For the life of me, I can't figure out what it is trying to tell me. Could someone in this group please explain how to build it? Is the mast asymetric? How do the dimensions work? I see a centerline and dimensions from that but have no idea how that applies to the material.

Would appreciate help with this.

Thanks,
Harry
