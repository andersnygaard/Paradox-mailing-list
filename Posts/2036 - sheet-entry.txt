Subject: sheet entry
To: paradoxbuilders@yahoogroups.com

A couple of months ago there was a short discussion on how Matt changed the sheet's entry through a new hole the transom before I make any holes, does anyone know? From the picture in the files, you cannot tell where the sheet originates or is it so that the eye-bolt is moved towards the center, and you cannot see the entry, which might be the old one? OR, is it so that there is no block on the boom anymore, just a single rope through that, presumed, new hole? i.e., you wouldn't need the gear?
