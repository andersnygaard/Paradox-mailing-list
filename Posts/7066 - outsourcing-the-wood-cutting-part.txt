Subject: Outsourcing the wood cutting part

A paradox is like a puzzle that you have to put the wooden parts together. That is how boat building is like in my mind.

It seems that people spend 3 years to make a paradox because much of the work is cutting the wood and making it ready. You would need to buy tools, learn how to use it, only to make the parts of the puzzle right. I think that is really nice but the only thing I want to make is a paradox. I dont want to buy many tools that I wont use after it and even though I think wood working is a fine thing to do, I dont want to learn now. I want to sail in a paradox more than learning about wood and carpentry.

These are the steps I was thingking.

- Draw parts in paper and take it to a professional carpenter. 

- I get all the parts ready or at least 1/3, build, send more parts to the carpenter, build again..

This way, I would need only to learn about epoxy and basic wood working things. 

Any problems with this approach of building a paradox in this way? 

Thank you
