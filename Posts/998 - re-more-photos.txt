Do you have any trouble with the transom port ?

Looks very cozy Al. I noticed in the picture of the water tank you mentioned that your tanks leaked a little. Mine did also until I made a handle about 8" long and glued some short pieces of 1/2" dowel rod in it at the appropriate distance apart. I can now snug it down tight enough to keep it from leaking and also open them very easily.

A while ago someone asked for pictures of the inside of Little Jim. I have added a section to my web site. Go to www.asjg.clara.co.uk/little_jim/little_jim.htm and click on 'Inside'
