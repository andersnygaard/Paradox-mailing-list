Subject: Re: Chine Runners

Hi Group,

I found this discussion interesting. Has Matt shared his formula behind obtaining the optimum shape for a chine runner? The reason I am asking is that if one were to put them on a larger design, how does one decide how much bigger, longer, wider - they should be, than those on PARADOX?

The design I am thinking of is Phil Bolger's Martha Jane, whose dimensions are about 75% larger on the same basic hull shape. I realize that the effectiveness of the chine runners is very dependant on getting the bottom of the hull down to the proper depth, and having a large enough rudder area as well, so there is more to it than meets the eye.

Also I have been reflecting on other methods that Matt has tried in his designs to prevent leeway, including leeboards and centerboards. To my knowledge he has never tried bilgeboards or bilge keels. Or has he?

I know there are a lot of boats, both in the UK and Holland that use them and I am interested if anyone with experience of using them may have to say in comparing them to chine runners. 

What are some of the advantages and disadvantages? Bolger, at one time was very enthusiastic with leeboards and bilge boards, but in all his latest desgns he seems to favor a centerboard and larger rudder, with the board either far forward, or buried in a box keel so as not to intrude on the enterior. This seems also favored in the BRIS designs.

I am still in the elusive hunt for a larger PARADOX!

Cheers, Nels
