Hi Jim,

Here's a link from Sven Yrvind where he suggests that somehow Matt Layden managed to self-steer directly downwind in his Paradox by relocating his lug sail to resemble a square rigger. How would he have done that? Did he have extra long lines for his reefing drum and tack downhaul? If he also moved the location of the yard attachment point, I can see that he could turn his lug into a square sail, but I doubt the reefing system would work, so this idea would only apply in very light winds.

As for the Weather Staysail, I've thought about that over the last 24 hours and I can't see how you would lead the jib sheet inside without snarling everything else up. Maybe you could attach it to a boomkin attached to the rudder stock, but then that boomkin would create havoc when tacking, so it would have to be able to be folded down when not being used.

Phew..., this is all becoming very complicated Hence, we come full circle back to the tiller pilot and the much simpler problem of is it a good idea to mount your solar panel on the foredeck!

Sorry, about the wild goose chase into self-steering, Jim.

Cheers,
Rob.

PS: Better get back onto fabricating that mast step.
