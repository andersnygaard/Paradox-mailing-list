Subject: trailer weight
To: paradoxbuilders@yahoogroups.com

Can anyone tell me the trailer weight of a Paradox? I was a little stunned when I first read that the displacement was 1410lb--twice the weight of my 20-footer. Then I discovered that that was the displacement at dwl, hence loaded and crewed. Even so, I want to know if my 1500lb trailer could handle one--and whether the boat could handle me! I expect most people trailer the boat fully loaded, since getting to the water and stores is a bit of a job.
