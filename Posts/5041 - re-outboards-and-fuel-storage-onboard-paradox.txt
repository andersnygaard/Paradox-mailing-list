Hi Greg

Do you intend to store petrol in built-in tanks?

Are you sure that this is a wise plan. What if the
copper tank springs a little leak...........Oh
dear...:-(((

If you store some in those 5 litre plastic cans which
are sold for that purpose and a leak starts you can
simply pick the item up before too much escapes and
move it  out of harms way/pour it in the engine/ chuck
it over the side even, if must.

You can also have a go at the vendor for selling you
dangerous rubbish...;-)  Compensation claim...;-)

On the other hand, if you have made the tanks which
leak there is no one else who you can pass the blame
to.

Err, how are you going to get the petrol from your
built-in tanks to the outboard engine? Hand pump and
pipes? More chance of leaks...

Surely, it's possible to use the odd shaped spaces in
the boat to stash something else not quite so
dangerous. Contraband perhaps.
