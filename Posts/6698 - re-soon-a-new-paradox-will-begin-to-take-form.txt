Subject: Re: Soon, a new Paradox will begin to take form ...

Hi Kevin,

It is good to hear from you.  At about an hour and a half, you're just on the fringe of driving I've done in the past for helping friends with their boat projects ... definitely do-able. When you're ready to get started, I'd love to lend a hand when you need an extra pair, and I would sure appreciate the help when dealing with my build.

Just as I was set to start working on modeling the stock paradox and the 20% upscale version work ramped up into major overtime for a couple of weeks.  Combined with class, I haven't had a chance to do more than think about my build.  I can't complain though, since all that overtime is going to help pay for the materials.  :)

Anyway, keep in touch, and as I start making progress towards my first full-sized cut, I'll try to post a note every now and then.

Thanks,

Stuart
