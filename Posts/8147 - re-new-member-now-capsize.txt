Hi Jim,

I agree totally, that's why I wanted to contact Geoff. The answers to these questions would be very useful to Paradox sailors. If the boat capsized and righted minus mast, then perhaps a jury rig plan might be useful. We need that info though.

I am on the east coast, Newcastle, but I'm just kicking off, a few weeks into the build. The more I study paradox, the more I think there's some magic involved. It's truly out of the box as far as solo longshore sail and oar stuff goes.

Fair winds,
Terry
