Subject: Re: Trailer

I have had hard time with this. The trailers which are normally sold for fourteen foot boats are a good size. However there are always rated for little lightweight boats. You know, the aluminum fishing boats everybody has to go fishing on the weekend at the lake, in. I bought one of these. I did put some tires on it which are rated for this increase in load. The trailer frame and springs are maybe over loaded. I only travel a 1/4 mile to the boat launch near my house. So I don't care too much. I launch by immitating what everybody else does when they launch and retrieve. I did have to buy a much lower geared winch, bigger weight capacity, for winding it up with. The pictures of Al Law's (Little Jim) trailer are of the most excellent in design one could aspire to, in my opinion. Pricy however i'm sure.
