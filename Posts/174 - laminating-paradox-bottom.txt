Subject: Laminating Paradox Bottom
Date: Sat, 15 Dec 2001 19:22:10 -0000


Hello,

I have a question about Paradox's 3/4" bottom.  I have enough plywood stock to laminate the bottom with one sheet of 1/2" and one sheet of 1/4", instead of the called for single 3/4" sheet. If one were to construct the bottom this way would it make more sense to place the thinner sheet first, or vice-versa?

Any thoughts or ideas greatly appreciated.
