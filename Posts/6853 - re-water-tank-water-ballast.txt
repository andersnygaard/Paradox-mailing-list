Subject: Re: water tank / water ballast

I've been going back and forth on that one and I have decided to keep the tanks. I am glad I did.

Here are my reasons:

Tanks are structural elements essential for boat rigidity and resistance to twist. 
Tanks will take substantially more water than you can fit in the same space in the bottles, so you will not gain any extra room for storage. With a simple pump I have running water in the galley. For longer voayges and cooking aboard, these are important features. Once made correctly, tanks should not leak. To keep the water fresh, I put a silver coin in it, which reduces bacterial contamination and helps to keep the water fresh for weeks.
