Subject: Re: I started the maxi paradox today

This is a great idea and one I did think about. I'm planning on  
doing the bottom of the boat in two layers to keep from having to  
manhandle the 19 foot long sheets of plywood. Due to my complete  
amateur status as a boatbuilder, I'm going to stick with the paradox  
lower hull with no mods (other than size).

I would love to build a "enigma", type boat also, but I don't have  
the skill to figure out the hull on my own.
