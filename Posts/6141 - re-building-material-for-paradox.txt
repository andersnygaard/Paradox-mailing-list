Al, you've picqued my curiosity about your mast in the water incident. What were the circumstances/conditions involved? When she shipped the two litres of water was the hatch open or closed? Any lessons learned? Sounds like you have some interesting stories to tell. Cheers, Mark

Look on my web site, <http://www.little.jim.freeuk.com>, under "Trip 4" for the story. See also <http://www.youtube.com/user/alopenboat> for a video of what happens when it does go over.

Lessons learned? All the usual ones, reef early, watch the weather, etc. but it also gave me great confidence that, even when I do something silly, the boat will look after me.

Hoping for calm nights
