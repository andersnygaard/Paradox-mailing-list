Hi Bill,

Funny you should mention "autohelm" as I have been thinking about that item this past few days.

Could you share a few details on yours and how it works for you? I am not familiar with how they work and find the vast majority of them to be quite expensive. How do you set it to hold a desired course? Does it work in concert with a compass or an interface to a GPS or what?

I don't intend on going on long passages, but I get tired at times during the day and feel inclined to take a nap for a bit, when sailing a leisurely leg from one point to another.

Will it work when motoring when the wind dies?

Thanks in advance,

Nels
