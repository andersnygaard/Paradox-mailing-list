Subject: Paradox Vs Enigma 460

Gidday

Am wondering about the differences between an extended Paradox and the Enigma 460 as far as intended use and capability goes. We are looking for something to handle a couple "comfortably" as a trailerable. A discussion of the two would be most useful to us.

Looking foward to your views.

Thanks,
Darrell
