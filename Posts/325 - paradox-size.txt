Greetings fellow boatbuilders. My name is Dan Fickett and I live up here in the little town of Friendship ME. I'm very interested in building Paradox however I have one large problem. I'm six foot six inches tall and weigh 200 lbs. and try as I might I can not fit into so small a boat for any length of time. Ive laid out some of the patterns on orange building paper at a ten percent enlargement and I'm now wondering if a fifteen percent enlargement might not be better. Would be interested in any coments you fellows might have on this large an enlargement and what you think the problems might be.
