Subject: Chapter9rev

Hello,

I spoke to Sven the other day. This resulted in some corrections in my translation, hopefully making it more understandable. The new version is uploaded as "Chapter9rev". It seems like one cannot remove an old file? At least, I do not know how to.

Glen, would you kindly remove "Chapter9", please (and perhaps change the title of the new one to something more suitable).

Also, Sven sends his best to the group and wonders if you have any questions concerning the chapter.

Best regards,
Kjell Karlsson
