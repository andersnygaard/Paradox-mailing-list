Hello Alberto

My new sail was made here in the UK by a local sail-maker. Mainly, he followed the instructions given in the files section of the paradoxbuilders site , but being used to making unusual and 'traditional' sails he included a few of his own little tweeks here and there.

BTW, There is a photo on the paradoxbuilders site of your boat with a a jib. Could you tell us how that worked out for you?

Best

Jim

Jim, you took the words out out my mouth:) 

Folks will spend hundreds on an outboard but use a tarp and expect the boat to sail like a champion:( 

I don't have a Paradox but love the little boat and will build one someday. I don't know how he deviated from Matts plans, but I'm building a Wharram catamaran right now and am shocked at the builder modes to his design. I know it's hard to stick to the plans but that's probably the best course.

There is an interesting letter on Jim Michalak's web site  about a Paradox owner who wasn't happy with the performance, fitted a lee board and reckons it is a great improvement.

Not much detail. From the picture it can be seen that he has made some design changes during construction, whether any of them are significant to the sailing performance is not clear.
