Subject: Re: Hatch mod stuff

dclark, feel free to use the idea as you like. The drawing is for the simplest folding but you can easely add one or two more folding stages so the hatch can be folded to rest halfway or all the way. All you have to do is figure out how long the folding plates have to be. The folding hatch in the drawing is probably to high for the purpose and mabye a bit long also.
Hope my folding hatch solved your needs.
