Hello Jeff.   

All good points you have made. And, don't get me wrong, I think the paradox is a great boat. I almost built one myself. I was just trying to offer some suggestions. For the sake of discussion, see my responses!

It could be external ballast, but as a supplement to the internal water, and pigs. Yes, the wing would assist with winward travel.

I just grabbed some dimensions out of this air. I would use a thickness that would give me the weight wanted. If one was to do this, you would have to "flatten" the area under the paradox it was to be mounted to, or build up an edge or streamline to provide a smooth flow over the plate.

See above!

One could use a grinder and "foil" the top. The foil section would not be as thick as the standard Paradox foil, but it would be there. Also, the Paradox foil is semi-symmetrical from what I can tell. Any steel foil would not. I'm not sure what effect this would have. Like, I'm not sure the semi-symmetrical foils do anything better than a flat section, other than providing a better laminar flow over themselves.

Again Jeff, all good points. My topic is really more of a mental tussle about the different ways someone may be able to "do" the Paradox chinerunners. However one would do it, it would be nice to be able to try different configurations of the CR and see what works best. I don't think that has ever been done from a scientific standpoint.

It would be great/fun/exciting, etc to be able to create a model and test various CR configurations and see what really works best. I don't think we're there yet.

Jeff, thanks the time you spent on your post.

Have a great day!
