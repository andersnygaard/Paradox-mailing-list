Hi all.

I have solved my problem with fitting the transom, bulkhead #2 and stbd side (f'wd) onto a single sheet of ply. I took your advice, Glen, and drew all the parts onto paper (or rather the works CAD system did) and then played jigsaws for a while. I have posted a picture of the final arrangement in the files.

All the materials have arrived now, so I have no excuse not to get on with it.

Hoping for calm nights
