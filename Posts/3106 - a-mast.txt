Subject: A Mast

Had a go at my assembled mast today and started by planing the face square to one side. The epoxy dulled the blade quickly but it is very pleasant to stop and resharpen.

As I looked at the mast I thought it seemed quite thick at the top from side to side. rechecking the plans and using the 1:1 sketch of the pulley I realise that the side blanks are not only shaped fore and aft, but also tapered in thickness. Luckily there is plenty of meat there so I will bandsaw and plane to correct size.

One step forwards and another back! I'm going to try to sneak up from the side on the next bit :0)
