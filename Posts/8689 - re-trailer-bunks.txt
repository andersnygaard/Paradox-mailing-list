Subject: Re: Trailer bunks

My next door neighbour who is a keen sailor has a spare trailer that he doesn't need that he's given to me for free - it needs a bit of work.  I'll look into the possibility of installing a number of transverse rollers once I have it.

Thanks for your input.

Cheers,

Rob.
