Looks like you're have a good time so far despite a little bad
weather. What kind of device are you using to update your blog? 

I've been using a mini laptop, an Asus EEE which is internally fitted
with wireless for WIFI.  This works well with the restriction that I
can only do it when in port where there is a Hotspot.  I used to have
phone card on my larger laptop, but that connection was far too expensive.

I've been thinking of using our Ipod Touch to do the same on future cruises
because it is very small and relatively inexpensive in comparison with
a full sized lap top. Anyway, have a great time, and keep posting.

I have an a similar gadget to an Ipod which could be used for voice
recording and uploading to the Internet.

I started my cruise aboard 'Faith' five days ago. The log can be seen at
http://bills-log.blogspot.com
If you can't find it there you can access it through
http://wwww.smallsailboats.co.uk

I'll only be able to upload the log when I can use WIFI Hotspots.

I hope you will enjoy reading the blog.

Currently weather bound at Ramsgate - snow is forecast, but I have a
Woolworths Hot water bottle - my trump card!

Cheers,
Bill.
