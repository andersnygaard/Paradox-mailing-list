Subject: Re: Paradox lumber and fiberglass cloth

If I pull my finger out, I should be just about able to glass my boat before the cold weather sets in.
Looking at cloth I'm really confused about the properties of different weaves. I've alreay got 450g/m biax for the bottom, but when it comes to the topsides I'm unsure what to use.
The only 4oz (135g/m) cloth I can find is plain weave, but it isn't wide enough. To get the width I'd need to go to 200g/M which I reckon equates to about 6oz/y but this is only available as twill or crows foot. I can get 25 metres of 260gm (7.5 oz) woven roving for less than the price of 10Metres of 4oz plain weave, which is more than enough for the whole boat. Do you think 7.5oz WR overall is too heavy?

All thoughts appreciated.
I have all my decks installed now and the boat is looking very different.
If I can get everything glassed I can work on the cabin top over the winter and hopefully by the spring I'll be ready for finishing and painting....
