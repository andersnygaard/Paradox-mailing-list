Now that's a good idea! I still have nightmares about bending the bottom and ended up 
cutting it in two and using a large butt joint. 
if you made the sides as you suggest could you do without the scarfs and use butt joints 
offset from each other?

I haven't updated my website to show the progress I've made lately (with the help of my two 
brothers), but we did the bottom last weekend.  We ended up wiring the bottom on and 
cutting &amp; gluing the scarf in-place.  The bottom scarf came out better than the side ones 
which were done on a flat work surface!

Seems like laminating the sides, you would just need to seal the sheet edges -- a butt would 
add hardly any strength, I'd think.  After all, your gluing surface would already go from about 
36 square inches (3/4" x 48") for a butt or about 384" square for a scarf to over 4600 square 
inches :)

Fitting out the inside and working on the vent trunk at the moment, though progress will be 
slow for the next week while I pack up the apartment for a move.
