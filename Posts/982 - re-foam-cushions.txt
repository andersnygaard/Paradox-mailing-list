Hi all; 

I thought this might be a good time to mention a source of foam in light of Al's post on the subject. After trying many different bedding materials including some 1 5/8 inch closed cell ensolight ($128 from Defenders which I found much too hard to sleep on and so returned it) I came across a web site: http://www.foambymail.com which carried Lux Foam under mattress, camping pads and ordered two 1"x39" x75" pieces at a price of $14 each and the shipping was free. I cut the foam to patterns and made two inch cushions which I slept on for two nights at the Cedar Key mess about. I was able to get through both nights without feeling any hard spots and can now highly recommend this foam as the most comfortable thin mattress I have ever slept on. I could not find the Lux Foam in two inch thickness anywhere but in the seat cushion area and the sizes were too small but if you drop them an e-mail it might be available in larger sizes. I'm now in the process of making the covers out of pack cloth following the instructions on Dave & Mindy's web site.
