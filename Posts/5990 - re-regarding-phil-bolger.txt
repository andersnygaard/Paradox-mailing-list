What a great tragedy!

Phil Bolger probably influenced home boat building more than anyone I know about and pioneered the "instant boat building" technique with boats like the Micro and Martha Jane.

The article does not say what led to his suicide, whether he had a secret illness or other problem he kept from people.

He will be missed by great numbers of people.

The Gloucester Daily Times; May 25, 2009--

Phil Bolger was a renowned and prolific boat designer, author and eccentric with a playful creative streak and a penchant to make boating easy. Sunday, he killed himself by handgun behind his West Gloucester house overlooking the Jones River where decades ago he perfected the wooden kayak.
