Making a transom hatch modified with pot belly seems like a good thought. Glen and Bill How did your mast work out here as far as storing the mast completly inside while trailering. Steve Yahn

I don't have a lightening rod (but it should be easy to make the top section removable) and I made my own low-profile light so it just fits. It would not be too difficult to modify the transom hatch so that it had a bulge (small pudding basin?) to accommodate the end of the mast if it didn't all fit inside.

I let my mast stick out the sterm hatch about 2' 6", just beyond the end of the rudder. That's never been a problem. I lash the mast inside the cabin with a rope to the grab handles; this secures it and helps prevent abrasion to the varnish.

Cheers,
Bill
