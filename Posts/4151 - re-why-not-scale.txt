Hi Al.

!7' is a lot smaller than a F33 or 35.
It would allow me to take someone along while having a separate sleeping area from the general sprawling/working place.
It would also have stowage space for my folding bike.
I have not tried to fit it in PARANIGMA yet but as soon as the weather moderates I will give it a go.

Good news.
The scaffolding has been taken down from my work area, so lets hope the next door developers can soon get around to repairing the hole they made in the roof.
About half of the roof is missing. I am surprised that the rest did not blow away in the recent gales.
100 mph recorded at the Needles so they say.
The warm weather will be here soon and I want to get this baby afloat this year.
