Subject: Re: water tight boot on the Paradox tiller arm

Wouldn't any adjustment be made by adjusting the bridle? I was imagining that you cannot play around with the bridle from inside the boat during the worst moment of the storm when you have to adjust the course with the rudder ...

Thanks for your good info on the lines. Concerning your rubber disc on the tiller idea, it would only be required I believe if you are hanging a drogue from the stern. Otherwise, Matt Layden's idea of using towels stuffed in the port should be sufficient. Even with a stern rigged drogue, I would first make a dynamic hydropistonning test to prove to myself that a waterproof boot or tiller disc or similar would be recommended. If I would opt for the waterproof boot, it would be a temporary installation for heavy weather only and the tiller port would remain open for fair weather ventilation.
