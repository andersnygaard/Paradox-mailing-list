Subject: Coastal vs Blue Water

Hi All,

From a Designers point of view, What is the differance between a coastal and a Blue water Cruiser ? Im talking about the difference between Matt and Svens boats. Would Sven consider Paradox a Blue water boat ?  Why ?  if not, why ? It would be nice to get these two involved in a discussion group like this one !!
