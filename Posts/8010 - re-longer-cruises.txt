Subject: Re: Longer Cruises

I know Geoff well. He has been an inspiration to me while I am building Planktos. His Paradox is a standard boat built to the plans - see pictures of Small Fry. Geoff has indeed made some amazing voyages along the quite challenging coast line of Western Australia. Shark Bay is a long way from Perth. Last year he sailed to the Abrolhos Islands and back to Perth.
