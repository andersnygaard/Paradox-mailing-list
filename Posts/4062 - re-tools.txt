If I could afford only one saw it would be an orbital jig saw. A
fairly sturdy model with good quality blades can do an amazing amount
of cutting.

Yes, a Skilsaw is a handheld circular saw and is also very useful,
especially for ripping long boards into strips for framing etc. Take
care in setting up a stable working surface and clamp things down to
do the ripping.

If you buy good lumber from a small shop they will likely rip for
strips for you for a small fee. The advantage of that is that their
machines are usually set up really accurately.

I have what is called a "panel saw" - a high revving handheld circular
saw that uses only a 5 1/2" blade. Great for sawing plywood and will
easily follow the curves if you set the blade to just barely clear the
bottom of the cut. It is really light as well.

With these you don't need a tablesaw or bandsaw.
