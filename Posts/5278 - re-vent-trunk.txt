To add to what David and Bill have said, I considered leaving the stbd panel removable but in the end glued it on. If I had left it I would have sealed it with the same stuff I used on the windows.

I have never felt the need to remove it, but if I did it would be easy enough to cut an access panel in it.

I've completed my vent trunk, apart form the starboard side panel.
I have a few questions.
Have those who left the panel removable had any trouble with leakage?
Have you fitted some sort of rubber gasket?
Have you mounted the halyard turn around block to the removable panel?
Do you actually ever need access again, or can halyard, furling line etc. be deployed through the vent opening.
