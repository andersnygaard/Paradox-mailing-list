Hello Roger,

I was just wondering if you ever received a response from the Bolducs regarding the plans? I have tried emailing them twice, once six months ago and another time more recently, but have yet to receive a response. I am very interested in taking a look at the plans and determining whether or not I can feasibly build this sailboat myself. 

I did obtain a copy of the Don Elliot book, but the sketches provided are more akin to cartoon explanations rather than detailed plans with specific information regarding the types of timber and other materials involved.

Thank you, 

Jason
