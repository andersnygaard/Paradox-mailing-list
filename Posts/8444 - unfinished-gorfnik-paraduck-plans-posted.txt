In case anyone else is interested in this interesting boat and to prove that I am actually serious about copying it, I posted my still unfinished PDF plans for it in this group's files section. 

Most of it is just copy/paste messages from this group and the microcruising group but I added my own drawings and calculations. 

I'll eventually post the final file and then delete this one but there is enough to get started if anyone cares to.
