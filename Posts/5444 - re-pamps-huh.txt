Hi there

There are places on the planet where the axiom is not ....'red, right return'. Among some foreign countries, there is a region between the east coast of Vancouver Island and the west coast of the BC mainland that also apply. 

These details are usually shown around the title or legend.

Lets see if I can remember this without cheating and looking it up.... If Im lookin at a red light I yield the right of way unless other rules come into play. (motor,cargo, etc.)

There is a little ditty that goes with the words PORT and STARBOARD. It goes; "IS THERE ANY RED PORT WINE LEFT?" So this way it helps you remember that the red running light goes to the left side of the hull, called PORT and the green running light goes on the right side called STARBOARD. When your tired and maybe seasick and maybe a little scared, all these little things are a help, at least it has been for me. Good Luck, Steve Yahn
