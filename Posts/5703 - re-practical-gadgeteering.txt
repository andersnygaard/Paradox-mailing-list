My outboard bracket is almost identical to the one on Whisper. It can be clicked into 3 different positions when the outboard is vertical. Each position provides different depth settings for the prop. The deepest position is not good for starting the engine, because of the back-pressure on the exhaust. When the engine is running it can be set at the lowest position, but I only use that setting when the sea is rough to ensure the propeller remains in the water. Usually I have it on the second setting. In the highest setting for very shallow water, there is some cavitation.

In my opinion, there is no need for any reinforcement of the transom.

My Honda is a standard version. I looked at other outboard types, but none of them was as well suited to Paradox as the Honda 2.3, especially because of the design of the cowling which is user-friendly on the mainsheet which I enclose in a plastic pipe to avoid snagging. Very infrequently the mainsheet may get caught on the propeller when the engine is in its tilted stowed position. If this happens I free it with a small boathook.
