Subject: Paradox Sailors Near New York State US?

Hello Sailors,

I have had the plans for about two years, and the build manual as well from Don. My mind continues to drift back to this boat and the challenge of building her. I have realized that if I wait for all the house projects and other boat projects to complete then I shall never get a start on building a Paradox.

Therefore, I plan to start the build this summer. I was figuring on building the bulk heads first until I read on the Internet someone suggestion to build the mast and booms first. Just a preference I suppose.

Are there any Paradox sailors or owners located near New York State? I am interested in talking and perhaps meeting in order to have a first hand look at a Paradox. In return, if there are those who would like to visit Central New York for a sail on Oneida lake, -- or close by the Great Lakes -- I would be happy to make accommodations. We know we like boats and can talk boats forever.

Fair winds,

Deric
