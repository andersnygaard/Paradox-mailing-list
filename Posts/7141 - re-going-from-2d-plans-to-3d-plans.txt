I think the creation belongs to whoever creates the models but I am not sure since those copyright models are always not very clear. But I think Dave could include the 3d files in the dvd, no problem.  

It would be only necessary a place to make them and for everybody to evaluate them before they become official. It would be too much work for only a person.

I do encourage anyone to learn Google sketchup, anyone could learn everything do make the parts in less than 20 minutes.
