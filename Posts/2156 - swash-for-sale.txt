Subject: SWASH, for sale

Hello all.

Regretfully, I must offer Swash for sale, due to divorce.

She has been built for my use and was intended to be a longtime relationship. Quality of materials and craftsmanship are yacht quality, and with minor exceptions, as designed. Swash has never been exposed to weather, having been garaged. 

To date, the hull is assembled, with foil faced foam installed. I purchased enough 3mm BS 1088 Okoume to cover the foam, but the option is open to the next owner whether to paint the foam as designed, or cover as I had intended. The vent baffle is installed. The yuloh is complete, but with only three coats of varnish. The rudder has been started. My notes will be made available.

All of the plywood necessary to complete the boat is included, and likewise unexposed to weather. With exception of the longitudinal floors which are clear vertical grain douglas fir, all lumber used was honduras mahogany. All interior components have been epoxied. No trailer is included. I will in the coming days, try to post some current photos in the Swash album.

I have receipts totalling $1600+, but misc shop supplies and a few loads of mahogany have not been included. I expect that total expenses are in the $2000 range. Considerable time has been spent to produce a high quality boat. The vast majority of this labor is a loss, as I am only asking $3000.

Most will know that I fervently believe in the Paradox design, and I hope to find the opportunity to complete one for myself, but at this time I must consolidate and try to get past my divorce. It truly saddens me to offer Swash for sale.

Swash is located in Rainier, Oregon, USA and is available immediately. Please email me directly.

Respectfully,
DC
