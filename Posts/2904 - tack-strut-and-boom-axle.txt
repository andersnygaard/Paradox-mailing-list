Subject: Tack Strut and Boom Axle

Thinking about the above items and wondering if they have to be of the given design.

Does anybody know, or have an idea, of what purpose is served by finishing both pieces in a V?

Wouldn't it work just as well if one of them was split and the other stayed whole? The split V wouldn't be so wide and the pivot bolt would be shorter.

Alternatively, do either need to be finished in a V? Left as round section each could be drilled for the pivot bolt and then bolted through side by side.

I'd appreciate any thoughts on this; especially if there is an engineering reason for the design. The schedule 40 brass pipe is presumably a US classification and not available here, but I have plenty of galvanised steel pipe :0)

Cheers all...Derek
