Have you ordered Don Elliott's build manual? (see files section 
under: Building-Paradox-manual-by-Don-Elliott.txt) It is well worth 
having.

You would have to be very creative to get the build wrong.

As to tools, apart from the usual hand tools my main power tools were 
a jigsaw, an angle grinder with a sanding disc (gets rid of those 
gobs of hardened epoxy) and a cordless drill (pilot holes for ring 
nails). Oh, and as many clamps as you can lay your hands on.
