Subject: Number of Paradox's built to date

Hi folks,

Has anyone assembled a list of Paradox boats actually built to date? I am getting my information organized to build one. I've never taken on a project of this size. I'd love to see a boat that has been completed before I start work on mine. I live in South Alabama and could travel to see one along the Northern Gulf Coast.

Thanks,

Perry
