Just a silly note on ballast. I once used some tungsten on a special project and was impressed by its very high density. It is uncanny how it feels in your hand. It is really very heavy. 

I looked it up. Tungsten is 19.25 gram/cm3 and lead by comparison is only 11.34 gram/cm3. Tungsten varies in cost from 15 to 35 dollars per pound when bought in large amounts. Not that anyone would buy this much but it is interesting. 

Maybe Sir Richard Branson would use it when he gets around to using a Paradox. 

Cheers, 
Steve
