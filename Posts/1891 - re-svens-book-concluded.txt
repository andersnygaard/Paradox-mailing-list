Subject: Re: Sven's book, concluded

Kjell,
I will be glad to speak to my publisher (as I have told Sven), but I know the problem will be with the translation. A professional translation would mean that it would be not cost effective to publish the book. My thought was that if capable volunteers translated it, and after Sven's approval, a completed manuscript could be presented to a publisher which would make much more economic sense to them.
