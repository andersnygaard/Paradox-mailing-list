My copy is fine. Thanks
Mike Sieloff

This is a notice to all members that have recently ordered the 'Building Paradox Series' booklet.

I have just noticed that the most recent printings of the Paradox series booklet has some missing pages (Due to machine misprint and resorting).

Look at your booklet and see if Chapter 12 or 13 is missing from the booklet, if so please reply to this message with your name and e-mail address and I will send you those pages as an email attachment or by mail. Chapter 13 for identification has a drawing of Paradox's righting moment and a sketch of Paradox in waves.

Sorry for all the trouble, however I will provide all missing pages as soon as possible to correct this situation. Please contact me (Reply to this email) for more details. Thanks Don Elliott
