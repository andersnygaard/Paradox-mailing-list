Subject: Re: deck and ballast

1. No, it will bend easily.

2. I melted down old wheel balance weights that my local tyre place gave me. I was told they usually have to pay someone to take them away.

Hi,

I have two questions:
1. do i have to wet the plywood for the deck to curve, or will it curve without splitting? 
2. I have problems obtaining lead for ballast. Any ideas for an alternative?
