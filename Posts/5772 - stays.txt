Hello friends,

I appeal to your experience and expertise to consult on a question that has emerged. In all the pictures and drawings of the Paradox, I have not seen any stays or similar. In this area, the winds usually blow with great force and unexpected bursts. What stays in place?

Kind regards,
Alberto
