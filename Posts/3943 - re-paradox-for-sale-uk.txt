Hi Derek,

Sorry to hear about your diabetic condition. After all that work, there is nothing to show for it but a great little boat built by your hands that will give pleasure to someone else.

Now I've made the decision I feel quite happy about it. I enjoyed the build even, in retrospect, the frustrating bits. I've also had some quality time at Poole Harbour seeing all sorts of birds that I've never seen before, and waking up to Sitka deer munching the salt marsh only feet away. Also there was the Kingfisher that whizzed by my head on the River Frome and finding a whole oyster on the beach. Don't see either of those in Wolverhampton on a normal day.

I've got a new project and two serious enquiries about Enuf. Time for me to move on, methinks.

Cheers,
Jeff
