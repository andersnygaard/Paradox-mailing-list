Subject: Re: What would you change on 2nd build?

I haven't built a paradox but something I plan to include if I build one (or a different boat) is some built in LED lights and the wires to run them. The lights use very little power so the wires shouldn't need to be very thick so easy to hide as you build. I'm thinking about the single bulbs like could be salvaged from solar yard lights and not fancy LED fixtures. Those tiny lights could be fixed in a small hole with a dab of clear epoxy or silicone and provide a surprising amount of light in a dark space.
