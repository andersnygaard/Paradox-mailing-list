Subject: braided carbon sleeves

Why is it that my mind goes creative right before bed?

Thinking about my rig. I could do as designed, but I really would rather go composite, as I understand Matt originally planned.

I would like to build my spars utilizing the birdmouth method. Whether Sitka Spruce, or a cedar less brittle than Western Red, I'm not yet decided. The wood would serve as a mandrel for carbon fiber, in the form of a braided sleeve. The wood mandrel would be permanent and semi-structural.

The braided carbon sleeve would slide onto the spar(s) dry, and then be manipulated to fit tightly along the entire length. Remember Chinese finger cuffs? Then the carbon is wetted out with epoxy. I would like to try this without vacuum bagging, as I don't have the equipment necessary. Oh wait... a refer compressor would work.

Anyway, anyone have an idea of where I might find braided carbon sleeve? I've found an orthopedic supply place which has it, but it is described as having been formulated for easy wet-out. Compatability with epoxy, ultimate strength/properties would be a concern. Ideally, I would find such a product within the aerospace/aircraft industries. I wonder if anyone has run across such a source.

OK. Sleep.
