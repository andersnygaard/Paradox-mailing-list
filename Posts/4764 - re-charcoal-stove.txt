Subject: Re: Charcoal Stove

A little kerro lamp might be just enough to heat your
tiny cabin, but it would be top fun to try and make a
very small solid fuel stove . Endless entertainment
getting it to work  and keep burning too.

BTW, Burning charcoal leaves a fine grey dust which
flies around evrywhere in the slightest breeze. Ideal
for the boat proud owner who likes to keep everything
neat and clean...;-)
