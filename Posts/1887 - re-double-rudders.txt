Hi Will, this has got me thinking.

On the James Wharrham Catamaran site there are drawings for a simple wind vane that does not use a paddle. It is purely the action of wind on the vane which steers the boat. I wonder if this could be mounted forward of the mast with the steering lines led aft to the tiller.

I must admit it would look unsightly but it would cure some of the problems of mounting a conventional wind vane on the transom. The only downside I can see is it would not steer a course downwind and it would get in you line of sight.

Some of the reasons for not using the VectaVane in my opinion is the course setting lines coming from the vane turret would foul up on the sail and boom and the rudder would hit the systems paddle when flipped up.

As for ever using a wind vane on a PARADOX I think the Idea is purely academic. If one is going to do a trip over a couple of days offshore would not it be better to do it in a more suitable boat. PARADOX and her ilk after all is a coastal cruiser that thinks it's an offshore one. Well in Matt, Dave and Mindy's hands they are.
