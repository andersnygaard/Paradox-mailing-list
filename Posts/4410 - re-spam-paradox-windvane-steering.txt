Subject: Re: [SPAM] Paradox windvane steering

Hi Glen,

All this is ingenious.  I gave up on a windvane for 'Faith' because I could not overcome the problems; therefore I'm pleased you have worked out how to do it. Several of my boats have had windvane servo systems for easy single-handed sailing.  I was relying on what people had told me about Paradox's canny course-keeping characteristic. I imagined she would hold her course like Slocum's 'Spray'!!

I'm looking forward to the photos and eventually the drawings. That will be a great service.

Many thanks,
Bill.
