I too have a line from bow to stern. Very useful when I anchor.

Regarding navigating self on deck:

Stay in center of boat,
Lay down - keep weight low
Have boom out of way - sail not hoisted
Use mast to brace
Life Jacket
Rescue line

I seldom need to go out on deck but the best tool to have is knowing when it is safe to do so. Sometimes I had to sail close to shore so I can get off and stand next to the boat to address the issue. A much safe strategy for me. The conditions of the waves, current, weather, objects in water, other boats, and other surprises will be noted in the decision making.

I have not seen a Paradox with lifelines in the traditional sense, I suspect that the design of the boat is for the most part was to contain the sailor in the cockpit/boat.

If anyone knows of a Paradox with lifelines (Pics) please share.

Safe sailing,
