Subject: Re: Paradox Vs Enigma 460

Seems to me the 460 is very nearly the same size as a regular Paradox.  A teensy bit more interior width, maybe, since Paradox has side bins.  Mainly the 460 is enormously lighter and structurally less complex.  I think an extended paradox ballasted to be on her lines would be monstrously heavy.  For this reason, I and my crew are sticking with a more conventional boat for now.
