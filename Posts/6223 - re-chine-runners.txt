Subject: Re: Chine Runners

I also meant to mention for newer members, that there are photos of two much bigger sharpies in the files. Hogfish Maximus at 32' and Jubilee at 40'. Both built by Chris Morejohn, and both have chine runners. HM has crossed the Atlantic twice at least that I know of.

I meant to mention them also because both have relatively large rudders as well as centerboards.

Perhaps Matt decided to forego a centerboard on Paradox for the sake of simplicity and reliability and to get more space inside and felt it worth the trade-off of perhaps a bit more leeway in light winds?
