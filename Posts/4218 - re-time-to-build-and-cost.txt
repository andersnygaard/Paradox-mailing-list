Subject: Re: Time to build and cost?

What could be done to shorten this timeframe?  I just want a solid, safe boat that sails well and doesn't need to live in the water (no more than a few days at a time, probably)

There must be lots of boats out there that fit that description. Your cheapest/quickest solution is probably to buy second hand.

I do like the Paradox.  I like the sleek, clean lines of it, the chine runners and shallow draft, etc.  I also want to build it myself, so I'm somewhat against buying something second hand.

I do think about other boats, but I always come back to the Paradox. With all the other boats I've seen, there's something I have to 'settle for' or 'deal with'. Philsboat is just too frumpy, and enigma is a bit too small.

I suppose I should just stop whining and buy some damn plywood, eh? Once I've got a great mass of dead tree in the garage, I suppose I'll be able to MAKE time for it.

If you haven't already spoken up, what have you liked or disliked about the building process, how long did it take, which bits were the most 'fiddly', etc. I don't want to feel like I killed a good thread here. :P
