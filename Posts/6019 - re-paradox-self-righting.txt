Thanks Al. It is very good to see how the rocking calms down so quickly. Very nice of you to pass it on.

Hi folks,

Last weekend was the Beale Park Thames Boat Show. Little Jim was there as part of the Dinghy Cruising Association display. While I had plenty of spare bodies I thought it would be worth pulling LJ over and measuring the righting moment.

I set the boat up in cruising trim with the sail hoist and a body (me) in the helm position. The mast was pulled down until the water was a couple of inches below the hatch. I had provided my helpers with a 25 pound spring balance to measure the load at the mast-head. Unfortunately the reading was "well over 25 pounds" so I still don't have an accurate value.

But there is no doubt that a correctly ballasted Paradox will definitely self right from 90 degrees. 

For a video of the exercise see <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Dt9zFRR3M2M0>

It is also worth noting the amount of rolling before it finally settled down after being released.

Hoping for calm nights

Al,
Yeovil, England.
