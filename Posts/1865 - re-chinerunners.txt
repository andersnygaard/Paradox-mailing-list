Sounds good,

The reason I bring this up is I dive local R.I. waters, most of our beaches are rocky, also I spend allot of time around the rocks diving for tropical fish, conditions can be quite different after the dive than they were at the beginning. On my larger dive boat I constantly rub up against and bounce off the bottom I always inspect and repair any deep gouges that appear, I will just do the same here. the plywood bottom aids in getting the fair curve. not like I would have to pay big haul out charges or anything. thanks for the input.
