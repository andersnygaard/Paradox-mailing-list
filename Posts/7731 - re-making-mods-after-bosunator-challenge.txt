Subject: Re: Making mods after Bosunator Challenge

Since adding the two fairleads to the top of the transom....I have not had a mainsheet go foul. That has turned out to be an experiment gone good. So far, however, I am not running an outboard or outboard bracket. I am sure that will open up another whole can of beans.

With respect to the Sailrite sail. Lezlie made it and did a very nice job on it. It sets well and I have been very happy so far. About the only thing I would change is to maybe make the sleeves for the yard and boom a bit smaller in diameter. Mainly the yard. It is small in cross section and gets kind of lost in the sleeve.  I am also thinking about adding a window into to the sail so that when sailing close hauled sitting on the seat, I can see somewhat ahead and to the leeward side.  Not sure if I will tackle this or not yet.

Thanks for updating us on your changes. It's the best kind of information. I was wondering about the sheet getting tangled in everything as they tend to do. How do you feel about your sailrite sail? I'm at the stage I need to think about getting one made.
