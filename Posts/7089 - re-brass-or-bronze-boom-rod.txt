Lezlie,

I recently used Naval Brass from Duckworks. Only time will tell if it will last, but I'm pleased so far. The brass appears plenty strong, and it bends before it would crack.

see post #7168, plus photos in my album.  

Will Tardis be done before the TX200? I don't know if my practice boat (PDR version of a Paradox) will be ready by June.

Respectfully,
Bobby
