Subject: Re: Little Cruiser sail

Little Cruiser's sail is far more complex than Paradox' sail. It is quite challenging to construct, and the segmented leech, battens, and many patches add greatly to the construction time. Though it is a beautiful sail to look at, I doubt there is much gained in performance over Paradox' simpler sail.

If you look at our sailmaking article and the rough sketch at http://home.triad.rr.com/lcruise/reviewb.htm, you will see that our sail has vertical panels that are broadseamed. The two horizontal seams on the leech are also tapered. The head of the sail, the luff, and the foot of the sail also have some round in them. Finally, this sail is still evolving, and future changes will include moving to 5-ounce sailcloth, adding more taper to the leech seams, and moving the forward portion of the top batten to the throat.
