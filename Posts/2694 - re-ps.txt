Hi,

Thanks to all for your advice, I think I'm closer to a decision on this now.

One thing Derek, are those boys big strapping lads, or little ones, in the event that I have to move my Paradox then I think I too will be doing all the work with my mouth:)

Those boys are all 20 years old and weedy, weed using, lager louts/art students. They also perform as a modern metal rock group. and are actually starting to get paid for gigs. Boat moving gigs at my house come free although none of them have paid me back the start up money I 'lent' them :0)  Nothing like how I was at 20 etc, etc, etc. (echoes of my father 30 
odd years ago)

The kit will only save time. I've enjoyed the build in spite of all the mistakes I have made. I must confess that I'd have had less mistakes if I'd have read/taken notice of the instructions. It is all a bit more complicated than an Ikea flat pack.

I first noticed Paradox a long time ago, but I was hooked on the idea of a pretty boat and for me at the time that meant traditional, something like a Wee Seal, or a Humber canoe yawl type, Paradox just seemed to modernist to look at. Bit by bit I realised that if my first cruiser was that elaborate it would still be cruising in the shed at doomsday. Paradox is beautiful to me now anyway, I kept coming back to this unique design mainly because she has done so much in reality not just on paper.

Yes, that's the main thing isn't it? She has a track record and it is pretty outstanding. I think that I'm right in saying that all the negative comments are from theoriticians and not owners.
As for beauty; what is beautiful about sitting out in the rain and cold of our English weather?

Best regards,
