Subject: Paradox Video?

There's quite a bit of video of Enigma and some of Little cruiser, but I've never seen any of a Paradox. In the files section there are torrent links, but the videos no longer appear to be hosted anywhere.

So are there any videos of a paradox under sail that could be downloaded? (or the ones originally linked from the files area).

In anticipation......
