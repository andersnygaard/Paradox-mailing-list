Subject: Re: Paradox Plans

Hello,

My name is Cary and I am a new member to the group, I am searching for plans of the Paradox, that I can buy. I did e-mail the couple in North Carolina but have not heard back from them yet.

I'm afraid you will have to be patient, Dave and Mindy are probably out sailing. I am sure they will get back to you as soon as they return.

Has anyone read the manual for the construction of the Paradox and is it worth the money? Any information would be of help.

Is this Don Elliot's manual? If you have never built anything like this before it contains some useful pointers (and quite a lot of less useful stuff).

Where are you based?

Hoping for calm nights

Al,
