I wrote Jim Michalak about his boats and he said that he considers them lake boats not sea boats.


Here is a cheap and simple alternative. None have been completed yet but several being built. Would work great in 3/8" plywood. Maybe even roomier inside than Paradox.

Jim's building book is also highly acclaimed.
