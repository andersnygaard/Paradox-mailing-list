Hi All,

Instead of making my own cushions, I purchased two chaise lounger cushions (patio furniture) at Walmart, it's a perfect fit. They fold up nicely to access the storage under the floor. I'm going to add velcro to secure them while folded. I don't think I could have made them any cheaper. A TV and DVD player are next :).
