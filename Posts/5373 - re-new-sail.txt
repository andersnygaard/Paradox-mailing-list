Subject: Re: NEW SAIL

Alberto. I think you are asking to know the distance from the forward corner of the top edge of the sail to the centerline of the mast as measured along this edge. I made a print of the new sail drawing and measured it with my dial/vernier caliper. I converted the scale size to actual size. The distance I get is approximatly 800 mm. However, if you want the distance to the center of the halyard attachment it would be 900 mm. It seems this dimension was not shown otherwise. I hope this is what you want. Good Luck, Steve Yahn
