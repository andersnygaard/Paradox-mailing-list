My observations were directed at the backyard builder.
One would be amazed at how much dissimilar materials are attached to steel boats.
Its all in the preparation.
To make the chine runners in steel would at the very least require two welds the entire length of the runners.
It takes a skilled welder not to have at least one or two pinholes in those welds, and we won't go into the subject of heat distortion.
Sooner or later water vapore would get inside the runners to the unprotected metal and corrosion will set in.
Our Islands boat yards are littered with steel boats that had water traps built in them and now have gaping rusty holes instead.
I suppose the best thing to do if the boat must be built in steel is to employ a skilled welder for fitting the chine runners.
