Hi Jeff,

I agree and I would go one step further and make the sides from 3/8" thick marine ply and make the bottom panel from two layers of 3/8" with a heavy layup of glass and Kevlar, as I have said before. I don't think a lot of us would be doing the sort of cruising Matt, Dave and Mindy do. 3/8" marine ply is just as strong as 1/2" exterior ply and costs about the same but lasts longer, and it bends with a fairer curve.

SHRIMPY the plywood CAPRICE which sailed around the World by Shane Acton had a skin thickness of only 5/16" and was built just down the road from me in Cowes.

I said in an early posting that the chine runners would act as an outer chine and I still stand by that. But on my version the bottom panel is 4' wide so the chine runner will have to be fixed to the outside flush with the bottom, then glassed over as per PARADOX. 

I read somewhere that the epoxy fillet radius need only be twice the thickness of the plywood. Any thoughts on that.

Its bloody windy here. Wind speeds to nearly 50 MPH!
