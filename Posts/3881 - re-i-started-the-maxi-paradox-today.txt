Just a thought.
Looking at Matt's video again and using the line of the swell rolling in, ENIGMA seems to be sailing at about 45 degree's to the wind.
In a cruising boat this is very acceptable. 
There are production cruisers still being made that just achieve this.

Hi Niels.
You must make sure the you place the centreboard so that when down the CLR is the same as when the board is up.
I would guess that this would put the board midships.
On the WaterTribe page http://www.watertribe.com/ChallengeViewer/default.aspx the video -
Wizard - Sailing as he goes outside and then comes in the St. Marys Inlet, ENIGMA, to me is sailing to windward quite respectably in choppy waters with a cap full of wind.
I would be more than happy with that performance especially when you consider she sports a lug sail rig and Matt has freed her off a bit to keep her going.
Is a centreboard really worth the extra hassle?

I would think with the extra length a simple narrow dagger board would really help pointing. Also the case would help support the deck and or roof.

Next is how far back from the mast to place it?

Niels
