Thanks a lot

Hi,

I found my first sketches of Paradox on the web half a year ago. That little boat just couldn't leave my thoughts..Then I found this group - and I have now decided to go on with my own building project. So some time in the future, hopefully, there will be a Paradox cruising in the Scandinavian waters.

I've read a lot of references to Don Elliott's articles on constructing the Paradox - it sounds very interesting. But where can I get the articles??
