Hi all,

The solvent that I have is a mix of Methoxy and Propanol. I've used it to clean tools and, occasionally, my hands :0( I hope that my liver lasts long enough for my grand retirement plan.

I've had a go with a scraper early this morning and the top coat (containing the filler powder) is coming off easily. where I applied a test coat of the proper mix it stripped off in one piece. The biaxial isn't moving but is sticky to touch.

If I've understood the advice correctly I will remove all the top coating, clean off with solvent and then re-epoxy with a correctly measured mix? This assumes that the biax seems to be well attached.

Cheers,
Derek
