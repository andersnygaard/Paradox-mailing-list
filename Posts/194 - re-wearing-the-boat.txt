Pete,

if you increase the boat by 10%, the side panels will fit within two eight foot sheets of ply (just), but it becomes a problem for the bottom panel which is not wide enough at 110% to fit on standard sheet of ply. But ply is cheap. 

Chris (ready to cut my panels out tomorrow, after I get over this hangover. (its midnight (1241), Brisbane time - i had quite a night last night, still recovering))

:)
