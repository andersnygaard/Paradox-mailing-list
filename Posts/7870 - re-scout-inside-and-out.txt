Hi Chris,

Sorry to jump in like this, but it looks like you and I will be building at the same time! For those of you who don't know me, I have a Michalak Philsboat and comment occasionally on the Michalak list.

I bought plans for Paradox a couple of months back and I'm trying to clear a space in my garage right now for the build. I've uhmed and ahhed about Paradox for years. About four years ago, I looked at an Auckland Paradox and didn't like the fact it was so dark forward of the ventilation/control box. Since then I've sailed a lot more in my Philsboat and while it's a great boat, the offshore/strong conditions that we get a lot of down here in Christchurch, New Zealand don't suit it so well.

Cheers,

Rob.
