Wow! Steve, thank you so much!

Those photos are outstanding and show so much detail. Just what I have been looking for.

I am just blown away by the workmanship of the roller reefing parts in your system. Did you make these parts?

I'm afraid the cost of such items would cost more than my little boat building budge! :>)

Again, thank you! I'm sure I'll have more questions after I have had tome to study the photos some more.
