Subject: Re: replacing wood spars for aluminum

Thanks to everyone who has replied !!
I've uploaded some pictures of the homemade roller reefing system.
The boom is an aluminum spar of 60 mm OD with a 3 mm wall thickn.
At the tang end I casted an aluminum round with a 10 mm stainless threaded rod inserted.This round was machined in the lathe for a snug fit inside the boom tube.
At the roller drum end the same casting was done but with a 12 mm stainless steel rod.This too was machined in the lathe for a snug fit inside the boom tube.
Two brass bushings where turned on the lathe into which the 12 mm steel rod had a free fit.
So far the boom turns super smooth but have to wait and see when the sail is on with the rigging lines if everything still works so smooth.
The yard is a 40 mm plastic tube into which a 30 mm X 12 mm wood strip was tapped in (all the length) to give some stiffnes in one direction.
This is all probably not much help to a Paradox builder but it's how I've done it.
