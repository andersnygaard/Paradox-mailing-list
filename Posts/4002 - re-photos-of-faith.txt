Subject: Re: Photos of 'Faith'

It's very unlikely that I'll insulate 'Faith'. My next main task after preparing the electrics and fitting the stove, will be to paint the interior. Then it will be time for the decks to be fitted. I'll have to improve the heating arrangement in the garage if I want the epoxy to gel.

How are you doing with your boat. Are you at a more advanced stage than me towards finishing?
