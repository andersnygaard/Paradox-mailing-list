By the very shape of PARADOX, She will not plane.
She will surf, but that is a different kettle of fish.
The BARTENDER, although a double ender, has a flat run aft with dead rise which promotes planing and stability.
The "planning rails" provide lift, give a dryer and softer ride.
No amount of "planing rails" or spray rails as we call them in the UK, would make a sail boat plane. No matter how much power you stick in it unless you design a power boat and put a sailing rig on it like some boat manufacturers have done in the US.
These boats are generally built lightly and have water ballast, a flat run aft and fitted with a centreboard.
I think that if you must fit an engine to a PARADOX the HONDA 2/2.3 HP would be an ideal choice.
Remember that a human can only generate about 1/4 HP. Any thing bigger is a plus.
In the States you have some very light 2 stroke OB motors.
