Hi Nels,

The only photos I've found are at:

in the album 'Mini Me'.

She looks a sturdy little craft, but I suspect she would be more vulnerable than Paradox, because of the cockpit arrangement and the high aspect rig.

I wonder if she has a daggerboard, because there's something that looks like a daggerboard case in the cabin on the port side?

Bill.
