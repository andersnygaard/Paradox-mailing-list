Subject: Don Elliott drawings

Pete

I cannot thank you enough for the link to Don's Illusion and Squeezebox drawings, even though I got so engrossed in them that I burnt the meal I was cooking! His drawings were so good and it seems so unfortunate that most of the hundreds (maybe thousands) that he produced are unavailable. I've kicked myself so many times for not saving them. Coupled with the info on pdracers there is probably enough here to build an interesting little boat. The dilemma, shall I shalln't I !?

Cheers
Neil
