Subject: Re: Bolger as-29 paradox hybrid

Andrew,
Close but one generation earlier.  I think that is a Jessie Cooper on the cover of Boats with an Open Mind.  Similar in shape to the AS-29 I think.  Also your description isn't that far from a description of paradox.  Heavy ballasted boat, pronounced rocker, same for the chine shape.  That is why the chine has a significant fillet on its top side.  The bottom is curved.  Who knows, chine runners might work.   It wouldn't take that much to add them although the slots for the bilge boards could cause complications.

Sincerely,
Gene T.
