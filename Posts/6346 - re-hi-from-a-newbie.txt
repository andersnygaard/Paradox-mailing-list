Howdo all,

My name is Charlie, and I have just joined your group after coming across the Paradox in some discussions on another small sailboat group, of which I am a Moderator. I am in the Southwest of the UK (Devon), and at the moment I have a Silhouette that I am in the very slow process of converting to junk rig. Initially, I would like to ask a couple of questions, I can't quite figure out how those bilge runners work, nor how they prevent the Paradox making excessive lee way??? Best, Charlie.

According to Matt they are a part of a system that includes the heeled hull shape acting as a lifting body. The chine runners then just act as a fence to separate the high and low pressure areas and discourage flow between them.

If you have more than a passing interest in the boat feel free to come and have a look at Little Jim. I am in Yeovil (about an hour from Exeter).

Hoping for calm nights

Al,
Yeovil, England.
