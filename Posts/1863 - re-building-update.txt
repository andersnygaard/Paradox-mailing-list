If you are intending to be away from civilisation for a couple of months then storage may be an issue. If your trips will be a couple of weeks then there is far more storage than you will need. So far I have only used two of the side bins and the FS is only used for bedding.

You don't actually go into the FS, just head and shoulders. I don't think I will be doing that underway unless it is very calm. However the boat will sail itself with no attention for minutes at a time, so it would be possible under the right conditions.

Don't forget that even when at the front of the cabin you still have control as the tiller rope goes right round the inside.

Something worth thinking about is the lay-out of the FS. As drawn there is a divider down the middle, an underfloor locker to stbd and a bin to stbd of that. The stbd bin is very narrow and I haven't really found a good use for it yet. At the moment it hold my wet weather gear, neatly folded, as I have never needed them while underway.

The central divider is crying out for modification. I have already cut a lump out of it to make removal of the battery easier, and am thinking of adding clips for commonly used tools. It could be removed almost completely, which would open up the space and make access easier (though then everything would need to be tied down better)

This is all cosmetic, of course, as these panels are easily replaced anyway.
