Hi Al. 

While a windvane could conceivably be fitted forward of the mast, I question it's effectiveness.

Most boats can be made to sail to weather with little problem. When the wind is aft of the beam, self steering becomes much more difficult. If a vane were fitted forward of the mast, it would be sitting in dirty air whenever the wind was abaft the beam.
