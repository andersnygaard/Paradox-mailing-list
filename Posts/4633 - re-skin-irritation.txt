Ian,

Be careful with this rash thing. Its not to be taken lightly. A common affliction of people who work around epoxy is becoming "sensitized" to all epoxy. For some people this rash can appear the very first time they use epoxy, for others the sensitizing can take years. The advice given here to try another brand is good but be sure and buy only a very small amount so as to not waste your money and use all available safety gear including barrier cream. This cream is commonly used by auto mechanics to keep grease and oil from contacting skin, making clean-up much easier.

Another trick is to use two or three pairs of surgical type gloves at one time. This not only gives more protection, but allows the wearer to quickly remove a pair of gooped-up gloves to answer the phone or use a tool without getting the handle messed up with epoxy. Good luck.

Hello all, 
Having begun to laminate the curved deck beams using West System epoxy, 
I've now got a nasty case of skin rash, mainly on my arms, hands and 
face. Very itchy and painful. 
I have taken the recommended precautions re gloves, clothing etc, and 
having been doing the work in the shed with door wide open. Perhaps I 
should have worn a good mask when stirring the mix? I've not done any 
epoxy sanding yet so it can't be that.
It would seem I'm one of those who will have to use some other epoxy, 
or get a good mask? Any suggestions most welcome.
