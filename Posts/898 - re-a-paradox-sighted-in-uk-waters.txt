Congrats Al, hope you get to sail her soon I know you will love her (him) once you get used to it. I sailed "Zoe" the other day with no water aboard and she did just fine. Matt told me he thought she looked a little low in the water so maybe I can remove some ballast or at least day sail with out having to fill the tanks. The yuloh does take some getting used to and I also find myself trying to find the perfect spot to tie the tiller down. I finally got around to installing the tiller stop and it does help a lot. Good luck and keep us posted.
