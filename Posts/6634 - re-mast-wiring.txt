How did you make yours?  Do you have a picture?

I embedded a waterproof socket into the mast just above the solid 
base. The plug is inserted from inside the cabin by reaching in 
through the vent box.

Others have had the wire coming out of the mast there with a short 
lead and a socket. This can be a pain when inserting the mast.

Check the height of the light you intend to use. I couldn't find one 
with a low enough profile to allow the mast to still fit inside the 
hull. I ended up making my own.
