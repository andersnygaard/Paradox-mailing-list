Subject: Another construction question

I'm getting ready to do the wet assembly of my Paradox after the dry fit. I thught I was all ready, but when I went to dissasemble the hull I noticed that the chine was nowhere near fair. I only noticed this as i was bending down to look at the fit of the stem. Basically what I have is a "3" type wave shape between the stem (top of 3), bulkhed 1 (middle of 3) and bulkhead 2 (Bottom of 3. It would have been easier to photograph it than try and describe. The chine looks fair over the reaminder of the boat, as does the sheer line. Never having built a boat before, maybe this is to be expected, and the chine log will pull the side panels in and fair the hull out correctly. I hope this is correct. I clamped an external 25x25mm piece of fir to the outside of the chine and it certainly looked a lot better. As the chine log is more than double this size I would expect it to be even more effective.

Can someone put my mind at rest that things will sort themselves out as I can't see what else could possibly be wrong. The cleat bevels and the stem all fit snuggly. I reduced the width slightly on the lower part of the stem thinking maybe the angle was wrong, but it made little difference. With the stem removed and the panels just pulled together at the stem the wavyness is still there. I've checked all bulkhed measurements and they are as per plan. Thanks in advance.
