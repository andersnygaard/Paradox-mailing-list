Hi All,

I'm going to try a 4 hp 4 stroke @ 65lbs on my Paradox. It is a bit heavy for her, I believe. Going to try it anyway since I have a new one. Any suggestions on how to move my ballast around to to make up for the extra weight? I have 400lbs in 25 lbs blocks between bulkheads #2 and #3 with most of it shifted close to blh #3. I'm not sure I have her ballasted right to begin with. She doesn't want to tack or sail to windward.

Still Learning
