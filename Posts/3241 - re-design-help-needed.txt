Grover:

I'm sure others will answer too but, I'm going to make a stab at it first.
The "wings" as you call them are (If I remember right) usually called
"chine runners" and there has been a lot of debate in this group
about their effectiveness.

Part of the reason that they work in the Parodox seems to be that the
boat is narrow
enough to generally heal at substantial angle when sailing.
This makes them act as more of leeboard or side mounted centerboard
when sailing.

I'm not sure if the Jewelbox Jr.
http://www.duckworksmagazine.com/store/plans/jim/jb_jr/index.htm
will heel enough to make them effective.

I'm going to suggest adding twin fin keels to the bottom instead.
But, I'm just an amateur and
you should probably listen to others with more experience when they answer.

I'm currently building a Bolger Teal, which is very simple little 12
foot boat and I think the
leeboard that it was designed with is pretty ugly. So, I'm going to
use 2 fin keels for it.

The Jewelbox Jr. looks like a good choice for you though. Michalak
has a good reputation and
it looks pretty simple to build.

Hope this helps
Paul
