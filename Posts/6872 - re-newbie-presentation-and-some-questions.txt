Hi Nels,

No it was when Sven lived in L=E5ngedrag in Gothenburg. It is the westernmost part of Gothenburg.
He was building, I believe, Bris no 1, so it should have been in the early 70:ies. Or so...

And yes, the part of the coast is really nice! actually the coast from Gothenburg and up
to the border to Norway is just great. There are some parts that are tricky to navigate
and the weather can have a great impact on one's safety and comfort.

Those who haven't sailed here should give it a try.

Cheers,
Karl
