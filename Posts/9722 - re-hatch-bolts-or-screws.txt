The reason bolts are always better than screws is in case water eventually finds its way around the bolt or screw (almost always with time unless careful maintenance). With a bolt, the water drips inside the boat and you know you have a problem which can be fixed easily before the wood rots. With a screw, the water does not go through, and just sits there inside the wood causing rot, then you have to change the entire piece instead of just resealing the hole. Worse, the screw releases it's hold at the most inopportune moment, Murphy's law. I have learned to use bolts, as Matt probably did long ago too.

Hope this helps.
