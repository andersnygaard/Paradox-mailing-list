Subject: Re: Yuloh

The traditional yuloh came as many other things we use from the Chinese. If you look at photos of junks and sampans there are often being moved by a yuloh. 

Traditionally the handle is connected to the deck of the boat by a short piece of rope. this rope actually did most of the work on these bigger vessels...the person just pushed the handle back and forth athwartships letting the curve of the loom and the rope do the work. Its worth noting that many of the old junks etc had quite high sterns, which may have been partly due to the entry angle of the loom into the water being steeper, thus gaining in efficiency.

For the Paradox I have not seen any mention of the rope, however, the boat is so small that it is quite possible it isn't really necessary, that the weight of your hand will do much the same. 

You are right.....the less cambered side is the top of aft side, and the more curved side should face down and forward. 

Some folk have tried sculling oars where the blade is in the vertical position normally, often shaping the blade like an Arab Scimitar. These have at least the advantage that the same oar can be used as a steering oar, or be left to tow obediently when let go. 

The Paradox probably is still best with the yuloh because the curve makes it stow more conveniently on deck.
