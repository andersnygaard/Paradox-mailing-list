Derek,

I'm sorry to hear of your enforced decision, and that you've had Enuf 
of sailing. 
Hope that your wonderful sense of humour will remain to the fore!!
I've enjoyed all your posts and the Duckworks article, and I'm sure 
that
all you've learned along the way will be useful in some other 
projects 
or pursuits.....
Pity I'm as far away from England as its possible to be, otherwise I'd
definitely be a prospective purchaser.

All the best,
Alan.

My Paradox Enuf is for sale.

I've been out twice at Poole and the energy expended sailing was 
greater than I imagined. I 
am a diabetic and I hypo'ed a couple of times. Very upsetting 
experience in a small boat, 
in the middle of the night, anchored just off the shore. I don't 
want to be checking my 
blood sugars every hour or two and nibbling biscuits and dextrose 
to adjust, or taking 
guesses with my insulin, so I've reluctantly decided to not sail.

Price: Boat and Mk2 sail =A3700 (includes 99 kilos of lead ballast, 
halyard, topping lift, 
steering line and rudder uphaul but not anchors, chain, warpage or 
electrical goods.

           Trailer absolutely as new, only been in fresh water four 
times (two launches and two 
retrieves) =A3500

You can see from this that I am making no attempt to recover my 
costs. I spent 
somewhere around =A3500 just on epoxy and glass fibre. I enjoyed the 
build, but if this can 
give somebody a quick entry into Paradoxing I'll be very happy.
If there are no takers, I'll be happy to negotiate a price for the 
sail and give the boat a 
Viking burial. The trailer will always come in for something.

If interested mail me with your phone number.

Thanks all.
