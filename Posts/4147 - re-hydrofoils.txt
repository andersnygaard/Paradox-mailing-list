Subject: Re: hydrofoils?- update

On Ebay I recently purchased plans for less than $5 to build hydrofoils from wood and epoxy. They have a 2006 copyright, but seem to come from an earlier Science and Mechanics plan. The foils fold up when not used and are shown on a boat with vertical sides. They can be used with boats up to 16'.

See illustration on the front cover of Science and Mechanics Feb 1960, "Build Your Own Hydrofoil Speedboat"   - scroll down the page http://www.foils.org/popmags.htm
