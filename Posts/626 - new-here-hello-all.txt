What a great little boat! The idea of sailing such a small affoardable boat across open seas is really a thrill.
I am building a Stevenson Projects "Triad" and have been looking for something that is a little more "sea" worthy. 
Where do I start with these boats? There are some great pictures and website but no mention of plans that I can 
see. Can anyone direct me to the starting point? By the way, I have never been "sailing" before but I worked on 
the Delta Queen and American Queen steamboats for 6+ years and love boats (expecially sailboats). The Triad is 
my first real attempt at boat building. If there is anyone around Owensboro,Kentucky who is into boat building 
or sailing, I'd love to talk about it. Thanks! Ricky Idlett
