By the way at the previous link I posted there is mention of building an Enigma 460 and if the prototype works, plans will be made available at some point. It will be a bit bigger than the original - now called the Enigma 360 - the numbers referring to the length in cm for each boat.

The 460 will have a hard cabin and weigh approx 260# empty. Some further details and photos here:

This is probably old news for most of us but for new members it might be of interest.
