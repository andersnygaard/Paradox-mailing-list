Subject: Re: Outboards and fuel storage onboard Paradox

I agree a stove would make a good backup system, small and light and so are a few propane bottles.

When you consider how much lead ballast is required for the Paradox and then replace that with sealed deep cycle batteries and a wind generator I think that the options for doing other things like a little radar and a microwave suddeny become possible.

Small wind generators have finally become efficient and cheap enough to consider, and of course would be filling up the battery pack anytine there was enough wind to move the boat.

I have an electronics background, 30 years, and I spent a lot of time looking into replacing the lead ballast with the batteries, including researching small microwaves and other accessories like radar and I also concluded that if I can find a good electric outboard that batteries would be the preferred solution for me.

The biggest drawback of course, is trying to find a decent electric outboard making the deep cycle batteries pay for themselves.

That and adding 2 feet to the Paradox, or build NOLI, I'm very interested in seeing those plans, it would really make it easier to implement the whole concept of an all electric boat.
