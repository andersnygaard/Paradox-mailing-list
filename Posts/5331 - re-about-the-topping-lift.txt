I got a message from Jimmy Lu about the topping lift, but when I replied it bounced, so I am posting the question and answer here:

Hi,

Sorry to be so long replying but I have been away sailing for a week.

My topping lift consists of a line from the mainsheet tang and one from the furling axle which join to become a single line near the top of the mast. This goes through a fairlead and down into the cabin. 

I set it up by hoisting the sail and adjusting the lengths of the three lines such that the boom stayed in about the same place when the main halyard was slackened off (requires a lot of fiddling about).

In use, the boom is lifted on the halyard then the topping lift is made up tight. The sail is then hoist as required and the topping lift slackened off. 

To reef, take up the slack in the topping lift, furl as required and slacken off the topping lift.

To lower, take up the slack in the topping lift, furl the sail fully, make off the furling line and release the topping lift, lower to the side deck with the halyard.

As the topping lift is only used to hold static loads there is no need for pulley blocks. A simple eye at the mast-head is sufficient.

Does that tell you what you want to know? If not, get back to me.

Congratulations on a nicely finished boat.

Hoping for calm nights,
Al,
Yeovil, England.
