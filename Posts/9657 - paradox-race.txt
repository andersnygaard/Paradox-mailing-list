Subject: Paradox race

Hi William and Paradox friends,

I think this group is smart and honest enough to figure out a way of levelling the playing field so we can run a fun race around the globe.

I for one would perfectly trust this group, cheating is of no concern to me.

Yes, weather is indeed the main concern.  But letting us self-choose a day within a month-long timeframe on a triangle course levels out that problem, since more wind makes the downwind leg run faster but the upwind leg slower. Choosing the day and even trying on multiple days is part of the fun of this race. Once the size of the triangle (and number of times around) is determined, we would all of course pick the smallest lake into which that triangle fits to limit fetch.  No automatic steering allowed.  

As far as stock Paradox is concerned, imho, as long as it is a standard 14 footer with identical weight inside including the passenger, it would seem fair to me.  I own two Paradoxes, both go at exactly the same speed when I race them.

I like the idea of encouraging an adventurous Paradox, but that also is hard to define, and I=E2=80=99m not sure we want to encourage taking unnecessary risks to win a prize!  Perhaps a simple distance-covered-while-non-stop-camping would be appropriate.

Thanks for giving us food for thought William!
