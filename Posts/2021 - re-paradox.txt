Hi Phillip.

I'm flattered that you would like to see my boat while under construction. The thought of 7 different kinds of mayhem at my beckon call is particularly tempting.

Actually, I'm afraid that I'm a little like an author who keeps the manuscript under wraps until finished. I'll try to post some more photos as I progress, so that the details are documented for those who are curious. I will also let you know when I anticipate showing Swash at a show or festival here in the NW. Thanks for your interest.

Will you also be building to the Paradox design?
