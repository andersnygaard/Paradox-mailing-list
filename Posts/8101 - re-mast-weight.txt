Subject: Re: Mast weight?

Hi,

My Paradox is about half finished and I had a boat builder help me make a birds mouth mast. A hollow mast made from 8 staves of hoop pine tapered as per the plan but it is circular in cross section. It's about 7 kg, very light, very strong, but expensive. There was about ten hours labour in it to get it to the glued up stage. I spent another full day planning and sanding it to be round. A thing of beauty, but at a price.

Why are you worried about the weight of the mast?

Hello Howard,

I use an aluminum pipe 63.5mm in diameter with wall 3mm and weighs approximately 6 kilos.
