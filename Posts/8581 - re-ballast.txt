Hi,

I hope did not understate my joy at the fantastic performance of that design. I read a sceptical report by the uninformed wondering if the boat, with no big weighted protruding keel would "go to wind". It sat so true on course yesterday, my other boat, a hard chained flat wide cat boat will definitely get chine runners when its overhaul comes due. I will keep that boat because I can take others with me day sailing, it's a Stevensons Pocket Cruiser. I was attracted to the boat purely as a project to hone my building skills and occupy my free time, it turned out to be a great project and it sails in fine weather well enough to be enjoyable. However, it's no adventure machine, a Paradox, built well is an adventure beyond the construction phase. I celebrated by launching the boat with wine and again last night after a busy day at sea.

Well done Matt Layden, thank you for the boat's great performance.

Nick
