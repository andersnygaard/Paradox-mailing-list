Also, considering using the S&G method for cabin top and deck, because, you can make a stronger more boyant top if the whole top is a S&G composite one piece unit that would attach on bedding epoxy with tabs that could be attached to the frame and bulkheads, even cold molded or built up layers ala Sven, thin plywood like door skin sandwiched over foam board with epoxy works for this, also I would use rubber window moulding like I used on my S&G power boat.
