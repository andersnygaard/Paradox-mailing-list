I'm putting this one away for the future, excellent idea!

Denny ...

It doesn't really matter if you do a bit at a time or all at once. I think I probably did the gluing in one go, but there was a lot of preparation before that.

When I started assembling Little Jim I discovered that the pilot holes that I had to drill for the ring nails were a nice push fit for a some wire nails that I happened to have. During the trial assembly, once I had a bulkhead in the right place, I drilled a couple of holes each side and pushed a nail into each. This meant that I could reassemble the components in exactly the same same place. It also meant that I could now drill all the other ring nail holes before mixing the glue.

Before final assembly start the ring nails into all the holes in the side panel, except the ones for the wire nails.

On assembly, slap on the glue to bulkhead 3, position using the wire nails, bang in the ring nails (finishing with those in the wire nail holes) and move on to bulkhead 2. Work out from the centre finishing with the stem. It doesn't matter if the earlier joints have gone off or not as they are nailed up and can't move anyway.

When fitting the stem run a line from the centre of the transom across the centre of each bulkhead and make sure that it lines up with the centre of the stem (otherwise the boat ends up banana shaped)

The advantage of using the wire nails as tooling pins is that you can assemble without glue and the parts stay where you want them, and you can reassemble later with the parts in exactly the same place. I used this technique at every stage if the construction
