I agree FULLY. I want to build a slightly scaled up stock boat as is. But I think I will consider designing it so I could test these other ideas out and if they don't work then I'll just use it as it currently works, which I'm sure will be fine. I mean I've looked at some of these other micro designs and this one to me is great. I mean how is a person really going to know if something then is an improvement.

Lead weights on tracks?? Interesting.... It may work, or it may be unnecessary. As all the internal woodwork (except the bulkheads and the tank top) can be removed in about 10 minutes this would not be too difficult to retrofit to a 'standard' build, when you can really see what you have to work with (and if you then think it is necessary).

Windsurfer sails....  Unless you have the standard rig to compare it with then you won't really know if you have achieved anything. I suppose I am suggesting that you first build the boat and *then* try to improve it (if you still think it is necessary)  :->
