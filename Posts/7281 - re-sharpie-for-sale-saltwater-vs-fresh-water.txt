Subject: Re: Sharpie for sale... saltwater vs. fresh water

Hello Mr Raghauler,

I wouldn't be too concerned with this as I'm sure it's a mistake. Mr Orlov is a very persuasive writer and makes some excellent points while arguing his case but when it comes to the technology of epoxy and polyester resins and their properties I've noticed that his understanding is limited. Still he's one of the good guys I reckon.

Paradox's resistance to fresh water must be OK as a mate of mine took his down the River Thames (fresh water) this summer and it's still in one piece.....:-)

Just how durable this ply core with glass and epoxy covering is I don't know. My Paradox was built only in 2007, and there is no deterioration of the hull as far as I can see but that's only a very short time. Since I'm an old codger, I'm sure that it will see me out, but that's beside the point.

I could see that there could be a problem if water got through a damaged spot in the glass and epoxy and saturated the wood core. And clearly fresh water would be more likely to cause rot than salt.

Best,
Jim
