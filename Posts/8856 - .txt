Subject: Cruise

Nick, glad to see you out cruising! I'm also starting a cruise for a few weeks, down the Blackwater/Chokan river and around Albermarle sound in North Carolina. Contrary to you, I'm facing freezing weather for the next few days.

Richard, I would be happy to collaborate to your project in any way I can...
