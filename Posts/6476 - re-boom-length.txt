Subject: Re: Boom Length

I've noticed, what I consider, a small anomaly on the plans.

Sheet 1 shows the sail with the original sail. The foot of the sail is 3350 and the boom (including furling spool) would appear to be approx 3450mm i.e. about 100mm longer than the foot.

Sheet 12, spar details, shows the boom as 3650, that's a whole 200 mm longer than above. 

As I'm going to use the new sail, which has a foot of 3180 I'd say that my boom only needs to be about 3300 long making it currently 350 oversize, which is a considerable chunk to carry unnecessarily.

Have I missed something critical? does the boom really need to have the extra 200 mm? It would be nice to know before I chop it off!

You may well be able to take off some of the boom, especially as you are using the mk2 sail. However I would suggest you not do it yet. Once you have launched you will need to adjust the balance by moving the sail back or forwards along the boom. Once you have done this you will know how much you can afford to lose. I find with my mk1 sail I have ended up with about 160mm of unused boom behind the sail. I have considered taking this off, but would have to see what effect that had on the support points when it is stowed inside. I probably won't bother.
