Alan, 

I knew of Zero but didn't realise that she lived that close for some reason I thought Zero and her owner lived in the southern states, Victoria or South Australia.

Don't know what made me think that???

DOH!! Thinking about it now I have read in the archives that she was near Stadbroke.

Brett.
