Ballast is irrelevant to the question of chine runners or leeboards.

Most Paradox sailors (all to whom I've spoken) say that Paradox tacks slowly and poorly. This is consistent with the chine runners acting as long keels.
Leeboards are equivalent to (actually, better than) a deep fin if you want to tack.

Best wishes,
