Hi all,

The refit is going good, slow but good. Everything is taking three times longer than anticipated. The windows are going in now. Then all I have to do is the lightning protection on the mast. I'm not sure what gauge or type of wire to use, it does not have the copper strip on the inside of the mast, All that was there was a piece of all thread and a small gauge wire (corroded). Any suggestions?

If you are going to sail where the beaches are rocky, as I do. You might want to consider putting some roving on the bottom of the top half of the rudder. ( Below the swim step) It takes a real beating, I had pieces the size of Dimes taken out.
