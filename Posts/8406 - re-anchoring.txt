Hi Chris,

I find anchoring on the Paradox quite easy as per Al’s suggestion.  I have installed a permanent line from the bow eye to the starboard side “handle” where it is affixed with a climbing carabiner.  When time to anchor, simply hoist the anchor and chain overboard (stored in the port cubicle just behind the seat) from the cockpit.  When enough line is out depending on depth, add 20 feet (7 metres) of line to compensate for the double length of the permanent line and tie a butterfly loop in the anchor rode onto which is clipped the carabiner.  Now when you let go, the anchor rides to the bow eye as it would normally had you gone forward.  I then tie the remaining anchor rode onto the rear deck so I can close the hatch. 

To raise anchor, just reverse the procedure- pull on the rode until you have the carabiner in hand, untie the butterfly loop and pull in the anchor, all while standing comfortably in the cockpit.  I then pull the bucket from the cubicle behind the seat, place it on the rear deck, shove line-chain-anchor into it so as not to get water/mud/sand into the boat and pull the bucket back into it’s cubicle.  I also have a fastex clipped strap (the big ones used on packsack hip belts) just on top of the bucket to hold it down in case of capsize.

Hope this helps!
