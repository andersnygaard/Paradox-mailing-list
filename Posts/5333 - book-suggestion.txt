The Title of this book is. SELF-STEERING UNDER SAIL by Peter Christian Forthmann. This book was a present from my daughter. I recommend this book because it is very thorough. It covers both  auto pilots and selfsteering systems for sailboats. It details good and bad points of each. It describes very well, and with diagrams and photos, ALL, the different designs. There is enough information to allow most boat builders to make a nice one, in my opinion. About 80% of the pages deal with windvane systems. 20% with autopilot. It has technical specifications for 12 types of windvane steering systems. Good Luck, Steve Yahn

PS. I have never built or used one myself.
