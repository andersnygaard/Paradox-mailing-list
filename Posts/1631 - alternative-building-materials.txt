Subject: Alternative building materials

Why is it that any question about alternative materials for building brings down calumny upon the proposer? Alterations such as stretching or stitch &amp; glue are apparently ok?

There seems to be a lot of fixed prejudices on display in the group and sometimes from people who welcomed the banning of a sailor for 'rudeness', 

I suspect that Matt built from what was available to somebody with bicycle transport and a limited income. He came up with an attractive boat that fitted his particular needs and the design was fueled by his previous building and cruising experiences. It can obviously be altered to suit others. All the Southern Hemisphere boats exhibit slight differences from the original plan and Alistair is thinking of mounting his anchor on the rear deck. Al has also found a topping lift necessary and didn't bother with the lightning protection in the mast. 

Thanks to all those who gave helpful advice about the possibilities and pitfalls of steel construction. I have found the thread helpful and will build in wood.
