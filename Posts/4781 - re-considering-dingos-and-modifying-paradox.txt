Subject: Re: Considering Dingos and Modifying Paradox

Bill,

I respect your admiration for the Paradox as designed, but please reconsider what makes a Paradox a Paradox.  I have a 1969 C-Type West Wight Potter that I converted from a Gunter Rig to a Hasler/McLeod Junk Rig.  It didn't cease to be a West Wight Potter in so doing.  I had another one that I converted to a Lateen Rig.  It too, was still a Potter.  Don Elliott argues that a Paradox is such because it is a complete sailing system.  This is somewhat esoteric since any sailboat must be a sailing system of sorts.  It is all a matter of degree.  I most sincerely appreciated your summary regarding the size of a sailor and the specifics that Matt had in mind when he designed the boat.  Must someone of larger size miss out on all of the charateristics he might find useful and go to another design just to preserve the sanctity of the Paradox mystique?  Life is in most cases a matter of synthesis.  We find from the many available variables the things that work for us and employ them.  It does not mean that there is a lack of appreciation for the original or the design.  It simply means that other ideas have been incorporated to personalize the outcome.  Thinking is not something that should ever be frozen in time.  There will always be room for improvement on anything.  I certainly aspire to personal self-improvement.

Again, this intended in good spirit and the hopes for healthy discussion rather than restriction.
