Have you ever noticed water slapping on the vinyl boot? Did you have water coming in before you put the boot on?

If you use a waterproof boot on the tiller, you lose the ventilation of the vent baffle.

I'm just wondering about why there is this big opening in the transom when the rest of the boat seems to be tight.

As I understand it, the baffle inside is high enough to stop water coming over the top under normal conditions and the tiller hole is low enough so that if the boat is upside down it will still be above the water. I don't know if this has ever been tested :-)
