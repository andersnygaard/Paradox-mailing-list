Jeff,

First of all, thanks for your comment. I get excited when someone other than myself takes a moment to ask anything about ENDEAVOUR. Now, as for the 7x14 oval ports instead of the continuous window called for in the plans...it was strictly me putting my personal touch on the boat so it would be just a little different from all the rest. That and when they are all finished and dressed out with the trim rings they just look down right salty! And from what I can tell so far, the visibility isn't compromised any what so ever. I did the same thing with the companionway hatch. I opted for a one-piece lift out hatch as oposed to the sliding one on all the other Paradoxes out there and it too has the oval ports so I can keep an eye out on the boom when all buttoned up inside.

Greg

My Fellow Paradoxians,

Well the scarfing is all done, and as of about 11 a.m. this morning the hull was cut out and faired. I laid out all the bulk head and deck beam locations on the hull panels and called it a day. If all goes well and according to plan, on Tuesday of next week, three days away, we will do a "dry fit" and I can finally post some 3-D pics of her. Its quite an exciting time here as we prepare to make sense out of the pile of boat parts collecting in the garage....more to follow and soon...

Safe Passages To All
Greg
