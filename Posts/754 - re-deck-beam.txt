Seven is the correct number, I was planning to make an extra, possibly for supporting the cabin roof and a hinged hatch instead of a sliding hatch.  One extra is also in case I find any defects in the others.

A. Deck Beams, 25x45 laminated to curve on dwg #7
Bulkhead, Chord length (approximate)
#1, 720
#2, 1102
#4, 1090
Transom, 820

Intermediate Deck Beams, 25x45 laminated to curve on dwg #7
Name, Chord length (approixmate)
Fwd, 930
Aft, 955
Cabin frame, 950?
