I too have lowered the bottom of the opening (to get my bicycle through) and I have left out all of the solid dividers. I have divided it up with bungee and netting.

I agree with Jim here. Openings in the hull, even if above water (most of the time) should be considered very carefully. The hatch would have to be big enough to get your head and shoulders through or you would not be able to reach the bottom.
