Hi Curtis,

On the Paradox, when you pull from front to back on the starboard rope, the boat turns right, as if you were pulling the bow to the right. This feels instinctively correct to me.

Of course at the same time you are also pulling from back to front on the port rope to make the same turn to the right. I imagine this as if pulling the stern around to the left. Again, this feels instinctively correct, to me at least.
