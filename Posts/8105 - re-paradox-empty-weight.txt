Hello All,

I'll be purchasing a new (for me) Paradox early next month and I'm trying to work out which vehicle I'm going to take on this rather long road trip. My car has a limited towing capacity but would be preferable to drive over my van due to noise, mileage, and potentially snowy roads.

I'm trying to get an estimate of what a Paradox would weigh all up empty with no water ballast. I'll add the trailer weight, and then see if my car can handle it. My car has a towing capacity of about 1000lbs.

Alastair Law replied:
1000lbs seems very low, it's not 1000kg is it?
I drive a 1600cc car with an 1100kg (2424lbs) capacity which pulls 
the fully loaded boat quite comfortably. I reckon the loaded boat, 
without crew or water ballast, weighs about 1000lbs. You could lose 
quite a bit if the hull was emptied, but then you have to add on the 
weight of the trailer.
I think you would have difficulty if you can only pull 1000lbs, 
unless you have a very light trailer.
