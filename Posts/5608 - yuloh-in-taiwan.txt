Subject: Yuloh in Taiwan

Mr. Jimmy Lu,

Your boat looks very well made and finished too. And I wish you long enjoyment with it. 

I have a question about the Yuloh. I'm going to assume that the yuloh is in wide use there in Taiwan. If this is true could you please tell us somthing of its use? Also, concerning the details of the yuloh in the drawings, is Matts design in agreement with common yulohs there? Somtimes I have found pictures and diagrams where the handle has a small rope running down to the deck. Is that always used? And what is its name?

There is extremely little to no use of the yuloh here where I live, near Seattle.

Good Luck,
Steve Yahn
