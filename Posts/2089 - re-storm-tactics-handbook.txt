I've not tried heaving-to, though it is on my list of things to be attempted. 

I have noticed that if the rudder is fully raised then my boat weathercocks till the sail is downwind. It occurs to me that if the boom could be held in the desired position then the hull could be made to lie at whatever angle to the sea that you liked.

Alternatively how about just having a couple of feet of sail up, sheeted in fairly tight with the rudder turning it up towards the wind. With such a small amount of sail up there wouldn't be enough drive to get through the wind.

Another unconventional idea stems from the fact that if the boat isn't balanced well I have trouble tacking, so if I unbalanced the boat and set up for a tack I may well find I am hove-to.

Let us know if you find anything that works.
