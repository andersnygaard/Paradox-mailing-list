Nels,
You are right.  I said about a week ago that you put the boat on like waders or boots, you don't get in it.  So, you are right, It must come in sizes.
Matt is the most efficient sailer I have ever seen.  I could pass him but ever time I started screwing around and not paying attention....I would look up and there he was...again.

Nels,
Thanks, I saw that when it was posted but I don't think I had yet been bitten by the "bug". I would be interested to find out how my dislike for tight spaces would respond to this boat. From what I hear about Wizard's size I think the boat needs to come in sizes so I'd need an XL. Now if I were to think up all the "improvements" I'd like to make to this boat I'd be willing to bet I'd end up with a Paradox!

Would be interesting to know more about it. Looks like it might be sunbrella. I thought it might have a spray skirt to allow paddling in the rain, but this one doesn't look like it does. Nor even a transparent section to view the sail from below decks.
