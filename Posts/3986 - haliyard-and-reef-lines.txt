Subject: Haliyard and Reef lines

I would like to share an idea. When Matt raises and lowers his sail, 
he applies a drag on the opposite line by putting it under his foot 
for a drag. I thought that we normally do something like this with our 
winches on big sailboats. When we ease off a line by allowing it to 
slip over the non turning drum of the winch. So I thought that when I 
am putting in the camcleats on the vent trunk, I would mount also a 
dead drum for a drag feature. Any thoughts?
