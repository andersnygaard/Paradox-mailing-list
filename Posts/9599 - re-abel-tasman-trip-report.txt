At the risk of promoting other boats on here that aren't Paradoxes, there is one boat that I've seen that I think would behave like a Paradox with a similar build time, but would allow me to have that permanently made up bed. It would still be a single hander and have no outboard, but COMFORTABLE day sailing for two is a real possibility. She might go to weather a little bit better than a Paradox too with her original jib headed rig, not the lug yawl shown in the video. She's called Autumn Leaves (https://www.clcboats.com/shop/boats/development-projects/autumn-leaves-canoe-yawl.html) from Chesapeake Light Craft. The construction process is interesting. You first create a central box that contains the companion way and hatch, the cooking station and bilge board boxes and then pull the hull sides around that using a Spanish windlass. But, as I've previously noted, Autumn Leaves at 18.5ft is more than TWICE as heavy as a Paradox when trailered. Is it really worth having all that extra weight, just so I don't have to put my bed away?
