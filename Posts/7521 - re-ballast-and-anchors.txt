I have heard others say this too. For that reason I carry a second anchor, a 10 pound fisherman, though I have only needed it where I wanted to lie to 2 anchors. I also have a grapnel which is sometimes useful when beaching to hook over a rock or a tree (but not for much else).

One of the advantages of a ballasted boat, like the Paradox, is that you can carry all this extra kit and leave out some of the lead.
