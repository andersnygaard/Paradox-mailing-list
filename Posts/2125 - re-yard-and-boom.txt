Hi David,

I had assumed that the yard was shaped to be light but with 
sufficient strength (I put the flat edge at the top), and the boom 
shape to be more to do with the sail furling correctly (certainly my 
sail didn't furl correctly when I didn't pay enough attention to the 
boom dimensions).

Hoping for calm nights
