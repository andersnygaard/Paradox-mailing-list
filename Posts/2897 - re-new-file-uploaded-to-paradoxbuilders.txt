Hey!  Someone is whistling my tune!  A 17 ft. Paradox sounds like a 
bulleye on what I've been shooting for; however, I am not clever 
enough to adapt the 13'10" plans.  I'd probably kill myself before 
my feet got dry at sea-trials!  Keep the group updated.  I'm sure 
many will be looking for the whole enchilada with the 'final touches 
on the details'.

Something doesn't look right about this reply format, but since I'm 
having trouble signing in to the group, I'll put it all down to 
inexperience and as they (whomever 'they' are)say, throw it up into 
the air and see what falls out!
