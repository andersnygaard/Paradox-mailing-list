Hi David.

While I'm sure some folks would be content with a portable antenna
option, I guess I would rather have a permanent solution. A longwire
with an automatic tuner is so easy, as the "wire" is already in the
Paradox design's mast, in the form of lightning protection. The
counterpoise is there, too. Nothing to stow, or aim, or clean; and
ready at a moment's notice. I understand that some racers have been
able to utilize a wire laminated into carbon masts for this express
purpose. I don't see any reason why this wouldn't work in a wood or
wood/composite stick. I used a long wire stuffed up a Technora, single
braid backstay aboard my last boat. Worked perfectly. And Cheap!

An auto tuner will by it's very nature, automatically tune a random
length (with a few acceptions), making the best choice of bandwidth,
simple to achieve. For checking into regularly scheduled nets, this is
 not so important, but when working Pactor (email), it becomes a
concern. Call me lazy; for shipboard duty, I'll take an auto tuner and
a long wire any day. I bet a Buddipole would be just the ticket for a
mountain top.

I'm not really even sure if/when I might install an HF rig on my
example of Paradox. As disgusting as it is to me (as a Ham operator),
a cell phone coupled to a laptop, is increasingly becoming a solution
for weather data and communications. Lots of options. For Stateside
sailing, I may well rely entirely on an all-band, shortwave receiver,
coupled to a laptop, for weather maps.
