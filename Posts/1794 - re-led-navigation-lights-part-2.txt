Subject: Re: LED navigation lights part 2

Thanks Al for a very informative post. Now I'm off to build me one. Here is some thing to consider: Since our little boats are only required to show an all around white lite (read anchor lite) you are giving up an advantage by using tricolor lights. The reason being that to another vessel you will appear as if he is overtaking you if only your anchor light is on (he thinks it's a stern lite) and he is therefore the burdened vessel and must give way. With your tricolor on he may have the right of way (in the case of a sailboat) and get closer then is comfortable.
