When reading about cutting the sides out by jigsaw - I have another idea, that I have learnt from some other forum or tutorial: cutting plywood by handheld circular saw. I have tested it now, cut out all my sides, bulkheads and bottom by it - works faster, but more importantly, the lines come much smoother. I hardly had to do any sanding for final shaping. Just setting the blade depth so that it bearly cuts through, and on smaller radiuses just lifting the back of the saw up a bit, changing the direction and pressing down again. May again be too late for your Gorfnik, but may be useful for some that haven't cut out their plywood yet.

Just for information - monoethylene glycol is what the antifreeze is made of. Just without additives.

Best for everybody,
Eerik
