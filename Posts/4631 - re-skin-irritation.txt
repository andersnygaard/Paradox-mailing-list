Subject: Re: Skin irritation

Hello all,

Having begun to laminate the curved deck beams using West System epoxy, I've now got a nasty case of skin rash, mainly on my arms, hands and face. Very itchy and painful. 

I have taken the recommended precautions re gloves, clothing etc, and having been doing the work in the shed with door wide open. Perhaps I should have worn a good mask when stirring the mix? I've not done any epoxy sanding yet so it can't be that.

It would seem I'm one of those who will have to use some other epoxy, or get a good mask? Any suggestions most welcome.

You could try a sample of epoxy supplied by UK Epoxy Resins.  All of the epoxy used while building 'Faith' was supplied by them.  Their web site is: http://www.epoxy-resins.co.uk/

I didn't suffer any adverse affects while using their products - a least not to my knowledge!

By the way, would like to have your details added to the data page at: http://www.smallsailboats.co.uk/paradox/names.htm?

If so, please drop me a line to:
