Subject: Re: SWASH, for sale


Hi Nels.

Thanks for the interest. Swash is still available. I've had many inquiries from folks around the world, but shipping an unfinished boat even this small can be quite expensive.

I have promised many people that I will post more photos. I'm awfully sorry not to have done so already, but the realtors and legal folks have had me pretty busy. My next opportunity for taking and posting photos will be 22 July around 0300 zulu.

The materials costs necessary to complete the boat would be up to the individual. I intended to keep Swash for the rest of my life, without regard for profit (loss). I'm sure that my estimates for the remaining materials would far exceed those of others. Someone could slap her together in double quick time, but that would seem to me to be a waste.

No glass has been applied. The chine runners exist only as the bottom extensions; no blocking has been fit or installed.

Thanks for the vote of confidence Nels.

David of Whisper kindly recommended that I focus on completing the boat as a means of dealing with the black whirlwind of divorce. I must admit that as the days go by, I am less put off by the notion of finding another build location. I really do love this boat and this design. Should I still have the boat by this fall, I'll set to finishing her myself.

Photos in 47+/- hours. Thanks again for the interest.
