Hi Roberto, 

yes I think a 5 hp might be the best, if I can found a not to heavy one!
Briggs &amp; Stratton had a nice air cooled 4 stroke 5hp, but I think they don't sell him anymore. 
I used that engine twice on the Yukon ( 2x 2300miles ) with my trimarans!
Here is a short video of that engine i found in youtube!

I was very happy with that engine, I had no problems at all!

To Nels,
well the Paradox is not really like a Kayak or a Canoe...
