Question 1

how far from the top of the mast does the halyard sheave fit.
I can't see any measurements on the drawings?

As far up as you can get it. 

I fitted a mast-head light a couple of inches high on top of my mast 
and had to slightly reduce the length of the wood so it would still 
fit inside the hull for travelling. I made the light sleeve over the 
top of the mast which allowed me to just cut a slot down from the top 
of the wood for the sheave to sit in.

That sounds easier than trying to drill through at the right angle. Gluing a little block of wood in the top to refill the slot should be every bit as strong.

Question 2

How does one go about bending 12mm bronze rod for the tack strop?

Sorted!

Some steel conduit, an old washing line post, and a bit of heat from a blowtorch seems to have done the trick!

Thanks all.
