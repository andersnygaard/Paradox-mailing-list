Paradox uses chine runners to reduce lateral movement through the water. They are aerodynamic "wings" located at the chines on both sides of the boat.

In the words of Sven Yrvind: "I am now convinced that the chinerunner concept, created by Matt in 1982, is the greatest innovation for small cruising boats in the last century."
