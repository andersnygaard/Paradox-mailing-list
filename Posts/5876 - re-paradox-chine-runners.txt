LOL no I have a swing keel but no chine runners. However I often 
sail shallows with the keel cranked up and it will track well on the 
hard chine like I explained, because the edge forms a vee in the 
water which tracks straight. My boat only draws 11 inches with the 
keel up.
 
Matt Layden tried keels on his earlier designs. Then he figured 
out that a Paradox rarely sails flat because it is small and the wind 
will make it heel one way or another. He came up with chine runners 
to extend that aspect and emphasize it, forming a psudo skeg when 
that chine is downward.

Hi Andrew, 

Are you saying that your sharpie has NO leeway prevention devices 
at all, other than the hull itself?

If so, how good is it to windward? (What angle will it tack thru, 
do you know?)

And is it a vertical-sided hull, or has it a bit of flare?

Thanks, Alan.
