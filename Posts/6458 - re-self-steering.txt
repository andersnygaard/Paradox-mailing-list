I AGREE...
I am a bit opposed to the many new hi-tech and electronic items that have become depended on in sailing. being a firm believer in "Murphy's Laws" I would favor simple wind-vane or other non mechanical means myself.

Can't resist: In recent news, Abby Sunderland is being forced to put in to Cape Town by the failure of her power-driven self-steering gear. She was three months into her attempt to be the youngest non-stop solo circumnavigator, and will now have to drop the "non-stop" part. Meanwhile, Jesse Watson is nearing the end of her solo non-stop, with a lower-tech wind vane that has proved very serviceable. John Vigor commented some weeks ago on the contrast between the two attempts, approving of the safety and reliability of Watson's approach.

Observing Bill's Faith, with his burgee on a small flagstaff at the 
bow, I imagined a small mast (half a metre high?) supporting a rigid 
vane (perhaps cut like a small jib). this could act as a windvane for 
a self steering gear and could be backed when tacking to help the bow 
fall off.
