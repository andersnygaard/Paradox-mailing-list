Subject: Re: Top of mast pulley (was Sail rigging)

Hello AF

Would a rigid metal band at the top of the mast with the block fixed to one side cause  a bending stress due to the couple it set up and being unable to articulate?

If the block is suspended from a rope strop then the flexibility of the rope would allow the block to take its own natural line as the yard moved, when changing tack,  running with the sheet eased and close hauled. The halyard load is seldom exactly parallel to the mast

I've noted that when on port tack the yard is pressed against the mast although the halyard may be pulling the mast top towards aft often. When on starboard the yard tends to pull the mast head towards  port. This effect is more marked when deep reefed on starboard and the drift from yard to masthead is greater.

On e of the limitations is to have the mast short enough to fit inside the boat,  which limits the effective length of a rope strop  when  fully hoisting the sail....

Personally,  I prefer to carry my mast stowed on the port side deck on top of the sail and boom when trailing on the road. Easier than loading it inside through that little stern port and leaves the inside clear for living in.  Also saves time when rigging at the launch place as I don't have to thread the ropes through  the vent box. So it follows that I'd make the mast very slightly longer too.

Good luck with making your new mast, whatever design you decide on.

Best
