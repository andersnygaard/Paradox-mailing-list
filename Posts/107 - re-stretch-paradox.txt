Hi Charles,

Stretching was addressed in earlier posts, I think the pros and cons were well covered. Matt say's just multiply by the enlargment factor (15 % in your case). you shouldn't have any problem until you exceed 25% and then you will have to rethink bulkhead placement and scantlings. If you have a copy of Dave Gerr's "Elements of Boat Strenght" you can follow his scantling recomendations. Hope this helps.
