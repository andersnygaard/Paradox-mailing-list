I have built a tiny boat after having similar ideas to yours. It is not stable. If you are reasonably small and lie down recumbant you may get away with it-but you will scarcely be able to move. How will you enter/exit?

I added side sponsons from pipe insulation material encased in polythene-these make the boat acceptably stable in calm water-but you get further and further away from the original concept.

Have you seen the Minuet? This is a tiny yacht with a ballast keel
