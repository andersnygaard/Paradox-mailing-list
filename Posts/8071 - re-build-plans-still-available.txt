Sean,

I was under the impression that the plans were only in digital format. That suited me so I did not ask about paper.

As it was it took just 2 days to complete the transaction from inquiry to receiving the plans as emailed attachments. (August 2014)

The "plans" package consisted of 6 files including a covering letter, "the plans", a list of materials, a photo set of the construction of Paradox Zoe, a diagram of a transverse stability curve, and a description of revisions to the sail plan.

Trust this helps.

Regards,
Gary
