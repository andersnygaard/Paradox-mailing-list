Subject: tack strop space tube
To: paradoxbuilders@yahoogroups.com

Just searched old post and got alot on this spacer tube for the tack strop but I am a little confused. My plans show the tube is not forked.. it is tied to the boom hook with a knot. I see construction pics from other builds and they show the tube with a fork. Am I missing something in the plans? Or is this a modification? Why was it done this way and not according to plans? On reading the back post I found most related to the forked tube. Are there instructions on making this piece anywhere? (forked)

Thanks for your help,
Rod
