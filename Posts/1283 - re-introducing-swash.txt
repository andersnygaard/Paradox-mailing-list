No worries Al. My casters sometimes get stopped up by a piece of
gravel, and while I can make good speed downhill, I sometimes have to
get out and push uphill. The net result is that I am slow, and tire
quickly. 

Actually, it would be wonderful to read some more stories about
Paradox design comparisons for speed. Glen wrote about sailing side by
side with Matt's Paradox, but since his trouncing ;), he has gotten a
new (and quite handsome) sail.

Of greater interest to everyone, might be a "round robin" event
someday. Owners swapping boats for some friendly racing on a
meandering course would perhaps highlight performance characteristics
better than owners sailing their own boats against each other. Just a
thought.

We may have to meet at Cafe Sport.

Regarding clamps: As I recently moved off of my old boat which was
entirely unable to support more than a half dozen small clamps, I felt
compelled to find more. 

I bought some light duty 12" bar clamps for $1 each from Homier, and I
discovered a sale on C-clamps and pipe clamp fittings at Harbor
Freight. I imagine they lost money on shipping (free) as I bought 20
6" C-clamps in sets of (2) for $4.99, 20 8" C-clamps in sets of (2)
for $5.99, and 20 sets of pipe clamp fittings for $4.99 ea. I had to
buy the pipe locally.

You can certainly get by with fewer clamps, as I have in the past.
With lots of clamps, I usually wait to fasten until after the epoxy
has kicked. With fewer clamps, it is sometimes necessary to fasten as
you proceed.

Nice shots of Little Jim on Bill's site.
