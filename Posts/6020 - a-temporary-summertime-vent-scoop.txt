Subject: A Temporary Summertime Vent Scoop

In anticipation of anchoring out this summer I thought I would do something to get a scooping action for the forward vent. A 4 inch pipe size elbow has an outside diameter of 5 inch. Just the same size as my vent hole. I got it at the hardware store for about 5 dollars. I ground a sleight taper onto one end to get a tight fit. I just smack it with my fist to seat it in. I can not leave in in permanently because it gets in the way of the tack strop. So I will only install it while at anchor. In the summertime any increase is venting and cooling is well worthwhile.
