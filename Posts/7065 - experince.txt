Subject: Experince

Hello friends,

With the desire to have had a merry Christmas, I wanted to share an experience I had with the "Cachivache" to prove how reliable the boat sailor is.

I was sailing with wind on the port quarter and a list of ten degrees, steering while sitting on the aft deck. My wife was inside the cabin and resting on the weather side when, without warning, the wind changed direction and caused the boat to jibe.

Quickly luffing and straightening the boat like a buoy, I was reminded of how wonderful the ship is and how happy I am to enjoy it every day.

Best Regards,
Alberto
