Subject: Bottom Fitting questions.

Some more queries for the builders.

I've now got my chine logs firmly installed (what a task that was!), and next on my agenda is scarfing my bottom panels together. That will leave me in a position to fit the bottom. Now, to do this, I think I want to be able to get in under the boat for the following reasons:

1. to mark the position of bulkheads and floor members so I can precoat the ply surface,
2. To check I have enough pressure applied to all joints to get some squeeze out of epoxy,
3. to clean up the squeeze out from point 2 before it dries solid all over my nice bulkheads and side panels, where it's guaranteed to end up!  

So do you elevate the boat on trestles high enough to crawl under during this process? At the moment I only have about a half a meter gap which would be a tight squeeze for me to climb into! Is it worth the hassle of elevating the hull?

Next -
Is it easier to fit chine runners whilst the hull is upside down? I would have thought it easier to shape the runners with the hull right side up, but of course this means a double turn over to glass the bottom again.

Finally -
I intend to use biax on the bottom. Do you think 1 layer of 600gm would be adequate or would I be better of using two (or 3)?

Anyway back to fairing chine logs and tank dividers.
