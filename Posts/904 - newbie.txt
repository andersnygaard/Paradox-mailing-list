Good day all. Where can I get plans???

Just kidding. I've just finished reading through every post on the forum. Thanks to all who have posted photos, especially Dave, Glen, and Al. 

I think that the most energetic photos that I have run across, have been the (2) black and white sailing shots of Little Cruiser. Isn't it unfortunate that there is seldom a photo boat around when you really could use one? The heavy weather shots of Paradox were wonderful as well. While I greatly appreciate the "documentation" shots of Little Cruiser, Zoe, Little Jim, and Whisper, it has been the action shots which have made my decision to commence construction of my own Paradox sistership. I will immediately email Dave for the details.

As a professional boatbuilder of (20) years, I will be following the plans as drawn, as I long ago learned the hard lesson of inserting my own ingenuity within the careful work of the designer. Al, you truly warmed my heart when you asked, 'why go to the trouble of turning a silk purse into a sow's ear?' Brilliant and so true! I see the preservation of the designer's efforts, as a simple matter of respect, not to mention, the best way to arrive at a worthy example. Congratulations on your recent launch of Little Jim.

Glen, would you please share your recent relevations regarding your sail's need for improvement? Too full, too flat? Any words of wisdom? Dave has mentioned that Matt's designs benefit from very full sail shape. What was Matt's recommendation for yours? 

I look forward to sailing my own Paradox sistership soon, and I will share with you my progress, as you have so graciously shared your own.
