Subject: Re: Vent Baffle

Have you ever noticed water slapping on the vinyl boot?  Did you have water coming in before you put the boot on?

If you use a waterproof boot on the tiller, you lose the ventilation of the vent baffle.  

I'm just wondering about why there is this big opening in the transom when the rest of the boat seems to be tight.  

A boot is a good soution that keeps the tiller inside the boat where you can reach it.  I'm not sure I would trust the rope tiller as the main steering system.
