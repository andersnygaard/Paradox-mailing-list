I feel for you, and empathise completely.
Under pressure first time in my paradox I hauled the sail so violently it took a month for my back muscles to heal properly, I ripped them badly in a panic to furl the sail when in truth it wasn't really needs as quickly. Nerves made me overreact.
Then got out in shallow water pulled the rudder up and didn't tie it off correctly for my overnight stay
It swung down full tilt onto the firm sandy bottom of the bay just as I put my foot under it and broke my big toe bone, limped a lot for weeks after
So many lessons are learnt under pressure.
Thank you for your story, Nick
