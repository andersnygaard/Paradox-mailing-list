Make sure you get the sides parallel or it will all seize up.

Are you fitting a window in the hatch? I have found mine very useful when sailing from inside as otherwise you can't see the sail easily. I assembled the hatch without the window and then cut out the window aperture afterwards. I was worried that the ply would bend crooked if the aperture was cut first
