Is there any way to make the mast light so it plugs into a socket and is removable? Maybe custom connections at the end with a screw socket or something. Also the lightning rod maybe could sleeve at the top and bolt down with a butterfly screw for quick removal. Just a Mcgyver thought. Rod 

It should not be difficult to make a plug-in light. However it might be worth noting that in the 5 years since I launched Little Jim I have used the tricolour only once, and then I don't believe there was anyone else around to see it. I have used the all-round-white a few times when anchoring, but a light hoist in the toping lift would have done just as well. I have much more faith in my powerful hand-held torch. It may be different where you sail, of course. 

Hoping for calm nights
