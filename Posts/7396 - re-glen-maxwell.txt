It broke my heart when I heard that ZOE had been destroyed. At least I had the privaledge to sail in her company in Cedar Key. Hopefully you will getaway for a sail in October. I finally got free myself and am presently sailng Enigma in the Exumas. Compared to Paradox she is very spartan and I had to be careful what I packed. Enigma lacks bilges so everything needs to be stored behind leeclothes on the sides.Also without water tanks and any rain catchment you have to resupply often. All in all I'd have to say that Paradox is pretty much the finest all weather microcruiser out there eventhough I'm still having a great time in the smaller sistership.

Hello David,

I'm afraid life has gotten in the way of my trip and I have had to postpone it. I am hoping to getaway now in Oct. of this year if I can. I fell into a real depression at the loss of Zoe and have pretty much just been a lurker since. Thanks for your concern as to my whereabouts. I plan to be at the Cedar Key mess-about this year. Would be great to see you and the others if you are going to be there.

Best Regards
Glen
