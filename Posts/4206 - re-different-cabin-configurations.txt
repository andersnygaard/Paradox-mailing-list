Subject: Re: Different Cabin Configurations

Has anyone thought of modifying the cabin/hatch configuration? Here are a few ideas I had thought of:

3-part sliding hatch to create a longer (2/3) opening
Removable/openable cabin windows
Taller cabin roof in rear of cabin for extra headroom - not sure how this might work...

I was also wondering how the stove exhaust gasses escaped.  Would a small vent stack just aft of the cabin be a good addition when cooking in bad weather?

If you use the search facilities you may come across Derek Clark's modifications which gave him more height.

I think you will need to keep in mind what you intend to do with the boat, because Matt has thought the design through very well for open sea work - integrity, watertightness etc..  As I'll be taking 'Faith' in open waters I'll be sticking to the original design.

Having not yet done any cooking on the stove I can only assume steam and heat make their exit through the open hatch.  There is, of course, the vent in the transom which may allow a through draught.  You guys out there who actually done cooking, give us your views.

PS. If you look at http://www.smallsailboats.co.uk and visit the Editorial page, at the op click the picture of Derek's 'Enuf' that will bring you to some photos of his boat, where you can see the raised cabin top.
