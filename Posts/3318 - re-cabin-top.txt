Hi Bill, I'm sure we'd all love to hear the Hina's capsize story. Did she have sail  area, design to Wharrams plan? Were you able to salvage, or righten the boat?

Thanks, Robert

I never wrote up an account of the actual incident for online consumption but here are two links about 'Twinstar' on my web site:

http://www.smallsailboats.co.uk/logs/log/twinstar.htm

Mention of the capsize can be found in both.

Bill.
