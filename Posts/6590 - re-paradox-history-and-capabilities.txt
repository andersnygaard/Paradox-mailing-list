Well,..... we may find out next year... .. .... or .... maybe the following. I have been giving serious thought lately about taking mine to Hawaii when it is finished. (after the approp. trials... both human and vessel) I have heard thou that it is an easy trip depending on the timing... I will leave from Marina Del Rey here in Los Angeles if I do it. I had no idea you could get freeze dried food that cheaply.

I will not say when the build will be finished because unlike 2 yrs ago when I started I have no illusions that I even DO KNOW when it will be done. I guess in that way I have grown in my thinking about boat building in general. By the way, I am in love with this art of building boats. I am gonna find it difficult to decide some day whether to build or to sail. Both are so much fun!

Even that has changed... one can buy 30 days of meals with snacks and deserts all freeze dried and sealed in nitrogen pouches and in a single 5 gallon plastic bucket for under $80 at CostCo and many other places. With a hand pump lifeboat type watermaker one could feasibly cross long stretches in a Paradox.

I would suggest that off-shore capability is very beneficial in a coastal cruiser. Sooner or later a sailor is going to want to make a jump over to a nearby island or cross a wide inlet or bay and these can turn into challenges as great as out on the ocean blue.

In fact Sven Yrvind states that coasts can be more of a threat than the open ocean, especially if caught upwind near an unfamiliar rocky shoal infested headland. This is where a hull like Paradox really shines since it can sneak into a shallow tiny cove and remain upright in the surf as well even if the tide goes out. And the crew are safe and dry inside if they have everything snugged down according to the designed set-up.

Phil Bolger suggested one time that the safest thing to do in a small design like this - if caught in a storm off a lee shore - might be to drop the sail, throw out the anchor and lie down in the lowest part of the boat. Of course if the boat is self-righting and shallow draft and water tight inside - like Paradox - you are already inside your "life boat"!

It's only real drawback is limited storage for long off-shore voyages.
