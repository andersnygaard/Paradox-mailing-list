Sir,

I would be interested in purchasing the boat, but it ultimately depends on the possibility of registering it in Spain. I must study this further. Additionally, my spoken English is weak and inefficient, so my telephone number may not be useful. It would be appreciated if any additional information could be sent to my email address. If needed, I can provide you with my postal address.

Kind Regards
