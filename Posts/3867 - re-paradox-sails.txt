Subject: Re: Paradox sails

Well Jeff, what I was recconing was maybe a larger sail - like 150 sq. ft.

I recently purchased a set of plans for Bolger's Camper Design #640. Length: 18' Beam 5'3" Draft 6" Two rowing positions and an open sleeping space for two people.

I uploaded an article on it in the Paradox2 files entitled Bolger Camper 640. Has a gaff rig of 150 sq. ft. on a tabernacled mast and a walk-through birdwatcher style raised deck. Would be really interesting to have the convenience of the Paradox sailplan and maybe even chine runners although the design is completely unballasted. 

Maybe install batteries for ballast and to adjust the venetian shade slats. Not only for depowering the sail but also to adjust for sunshine and air flow into the cabin:-)

And of course to keep the drinks cold in the electric cooler.
