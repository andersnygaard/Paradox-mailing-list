Subject: Re: Cutting the windows for 'Faith'

Progress has better than I had hoped; therefore after making the stowage racks for the yuloh and the sail I'll paint the deck and make the windows.  After that it'll be attaching the deck fittings.
When all the upperworks have been finished I'll take the boat outside to the lawn where I'll turn her on her side to do the antifouling which is Copperbot - should last 10 years; then I'll do the sides and paint them.  I'm not sure if that will be the exact order.

Nothing else needs making.  I'll only have to rig her and she'll be ready for the water.  I'm still planning on 3 weeks or more, if the weather keeps fine, more if it doesn't.

Cheers,
Bill.
