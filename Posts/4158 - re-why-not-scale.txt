Hi JG.
The 17 foot design I am working on is a total new design following the PARADOX/LITTLE CRUISER style.
Stats at the early stage. LOA 17' X 4' 10" x 10" x 1860lbs.
The hull shape is the next step on from ENIGMA if you count it as 2 and PARADOX as 1, the new shape would be step 3.
The new hull shape is designed to cut down on drag when heeled.
As soon as I can transfer files from my Win 98 computer I will post a lines plan.
