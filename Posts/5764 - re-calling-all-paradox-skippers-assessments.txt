Subject: Re: Calling all Paradox skippers: assessments?

I built mine stitch and glue, skinned the whole thing in 2 oz FG 2 layers, for the bottom I used 12 oz biax fg, 1 layer, the rest pretty much per plan, no nails or screws in it at all. I sewed My sails, It was great for learning how to, and it was not that difficult. While building the boat, studying the plans, as I cut fit and built the parts, I often wondered what Matt was thinking, or the whys of it... But when you complete the boat, get her in the water and spend some time with her, you start to understand those questions, you experience the fruit of Matts time and effort, trial and error. a boat of this size, that will trim up Very easily and keep going in the same manner for miles is very impressive. seems to me that each of its components compliments the rest, with great balance.

My Paradox is still in great shape, the way I had built the chinerunners seem to be holding up great, bottom is still in great shape, I will prob give her a coat of paint in the spring.

One thing I would like to add is that I added a boltrope to the leading edge of the sail, it is loose in the sleeve, from the boom I can adjust the tension of the luff, or leading edge, Im using the 2nd sail plan or mk2?? anyway it has helped in triming the sail, or making it shape correclty, bonus is that it behaves better on the roller.
