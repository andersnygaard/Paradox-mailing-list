Wardang Island on a calm day
Letting go of the tiller causes the rudder to hard over
It sucks the rudder full over one way
Holding the iPad to catch the action means no steering
So I went round and round and round, the Dolphins followed me for 15 minutes into the shallows of the south end of the island.

Subject: Furling update

Hi, just an update on furling. I've taken the example of others and fitted one longer rope to the tumbler, it goes around the tumbler (four turns when the sail is down), through the cabin and up the mast as the halyard as well, one long loop as described by others, not as it was two separate ropes.

I'm using 8 mm rope, I was using thinner rope for the tumbler and thicker 10 mm rope for the halyard, they are now retired from use and the new softer more pliable rope is a joy.

Hope somewhere around the world someone is reading this from the cabin of a paradox.

Another day of sailing, it has at last warmed up enough to go sailing, 27 C, 5 to 15 kts.
After weeks of alterations to the boat, I got to test it in the Port River at Adelaide.
It's a narrow body of water highly industrialised and full of traffic to navigate.

There was much more to the day than just testing my alterations, and joy of joy they all worked! Hope others are out there too.

Hi, I have a U bolt through my bow. Remember if it's placed too high it forces the boat nose down as you winch it, and can make loading onto the trailer difficult.
