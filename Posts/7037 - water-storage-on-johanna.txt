Subject: Water storage on Johanna
Date: Thu, 03 Nov 2011 03:22:38 -0000

Hello everyone.

Hey Pete, now that Johanna is in service, would you change anything of the method you chose for water storage? The only picture I've seen of your solution was early on in your build; I'm assuming that you stayed with the water bottle idea and that little changed structurally from the photograph of March, 2008. I've always thought the original design added unnecessary complexity regarding water storage and that the tanks would prove problematic in service. I found your solution quite elegant, addressing all my concerns, but I've wondered if the loss of structural integrity (mainly, the lid no longer being part of structural framework) would cause the hull to "work" in that area in a seaway. In retrospect, would you have done anything differently? This is of special concern for me, as I have opted to increase my own build size by 10%.

Let me just add that your documentation of the build process on your blog is top-notch and has proven to be an incredibly useful reference. Also add my voice to the multitude that I'm sure have given you raves for the end result of your efforts. Johanna is truly a beauty.
