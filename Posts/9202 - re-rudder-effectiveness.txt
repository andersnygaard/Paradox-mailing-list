Thank you

I thought it hard to control, too hard. I've been at 7 knots in it, running almost directly downwind, and as waves washed under the boat slowly it was a real bother to keep course. It was my fastest sail ever and while 7 knots was momentary it occurred often over three hours. I need to use less energy and effort sailing, I practically feint at day's end. After three days I need to get hauled out and rest at home a few days, it's exhausting, and the best fun I've had in years.
