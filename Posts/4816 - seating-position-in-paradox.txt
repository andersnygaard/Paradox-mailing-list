Subject: Seating Position in Paradox
Date: Wed, 23 Jan 2008 03:07:36 -0000

In the afore-mentioned file showing interior shots of Glen in Zoe I would like to mention the last two photos.

If I were to sit in that position for any length of time I would develop very severe lower back pain. If I sit up straight then I have no problem.

Just thought I would mention that in case anyone has that same problem.

I thought Derek had a good idea with raising the hatch sides to provide more head room. Maybe with a transparent window in the forward section, and maybe the overhead -  so one could sit more upright and still keep the hatch closed when it is raining say. Also it might be an idea for a taller person.

Sort of a mini pilothouse.

Any thoughts on that?
