Subject: Light weight Paradox mast

I remember when Matt Layden was first building Paradox he spoke of using carbon fiber in the construction of his wood mast. Initially he hoped to use carbon tow on the inside staves, but for simplicity sake he ended up just building a plain wood mast. I wonder if he could have saved some weight aloft and at the same time built a stronger mast.
