Not so much wisdom, merely observation. Those of you who remember the pictures of my early launches may recall that I had a nice white line round the sheer. This was made from 2 inch pvc tape. Well after this trip most of it was wrapped round the mast and cabin as it had been washed off the sides and over the deck. It is perhaps worth noting that not a drop of water came inside.

Thanks again Matt.

Hoping for calm nights
