Subject: Re: Paradox cabin

Hello friends 

I started to draw the bulkheads at the plate and before cutting the 
idea arose enlarge the cabin, take it to the edge of hull. Doubt Is 
it something affects any of the parameters of the boat? 
Best regards 
Alberto

When the sail is lowered it is stowed on the port side deck,and the 
yuloh is kept on the starboard side deck.

If you extended the cabin top to the sides of the boat you would find 
it more difficult to get forward to attend to things like the anchor 
or fending off.

There would be additional windage - especially not wanted when going 
to windward.

Unless you did away with the internal side bins, the actual usuable 
space within the cabin would not be increased.

I can see little advantage in widening the cabin top.

Bill.
