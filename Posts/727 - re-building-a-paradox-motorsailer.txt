To start with I must say that I know little about boat design, others on this forum can cover that much better than me, but to quote one of them "why make a sows ear out of a silk purse?"

Paradox is designed as a coastal cruiser, and a very sturdy and heavy one at that. If you want a river or canal boat I would start with something designed for that environment.

On your comment about balancing the extra weight aft with extra weight forward, I know from my day job that static balance is easy to achieve but getting the moment of inertia right is much more difficult.

As to CAD it can be used to show whatever shape you want to give it, but that will tell you nothing about how it will perform. As a real engineer (Sir Alec Issigonis) once told me "First do the design, then when it is finished put it on paper".

However, as I say, I know nothing about boat design, so you may have a great idea.
