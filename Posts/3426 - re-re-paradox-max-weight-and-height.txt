See what you've done Jim? It's all gone quiet!

James,

That sounds like a certain person's picture and is probably copyrighted, meaning that we are not allowed to discuss it :0)

Your idea of using it as emergency flotation is ok, except that if it was used in earnest the boat would float bow up and stern down. The poor survivor would have to sit on the stem awaiting rescue. Still, that's better than sinking, isn't it?
I wouldn't worry which way it floated so long as it did. My intention, which I hope never to test, is to stay in the boat. If it floats with the water at deck level you are still better staying in it than getting out.
