Hi Mike,

The neat thing about angles is that they are the same no matter what scale you are working from. Just take a bevel square and lift them from the drawings and mark and cut the timber or use the bevel square to set your saw with after lifting the angle from the drawing.

This is what I did, but afterwards I wondered if it would not have been easier to plane the bevels after assembly as I got some of them wrong and had to pad them out with a strip of wood and recut them. But on the other hand none of it needs to be too accurate, epoxy fixes the mistakes.

Hoping for calm nights
