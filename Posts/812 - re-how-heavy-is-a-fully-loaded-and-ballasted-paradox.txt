Back to archimedes:


Maybe you don't trust Chuck, so try these web sites:

 Water Displacement (US Dept. of energy) 

From that site are the following quotes:


"An object that FLOATS displaces the amount of water that has the same weight
as the object.  If it sinks, it displaces an amount of water that has less
weight than the object.  This is generally attributed to an ancient Greek
known as Archimedes.

Greg Bradburn
=============================================
If the object is less dense than water (if it floats on water), it
displaces a weight of water equal to the weight of the object.  If the
object sinks in water, it simply displaces a volume of water equal to the
volume of the object.

This is known as the Principle of Archimedes.


                Richard Barrans Jr., Ph.D."

Or from this site:

 Elements of Physics  (University of Alaska)

"Archimedes' principle
Archimedes' principle states that the buoyant force exerted on a body 
immersed in a fluid is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the body
. ( B = - w of fluid ) "    



what makes a boat float on a particular waterline  is its weight. If you add 
,say 100 lbs of weight to the boat, you have just displaced an additional 100 
lbs of water. They are exactly equivalent. and, of course, the water will 
have the same volume whether the 100 lbs you added was lead, feathers, or 
foam. How could it be different? How would the water Know what you added? 

A boat can displace less than it weighs (If it has sunk) but it can NEVER 
displace more than it weighs.
