There is also a Paradox "clone" called Robbsboat.  It is designed by Jim Michalak.   It is a much simpler, more basic boat, but with the same lines as the Paradox in a 16X4 package.  The interior main "room" is 4X8 with no shelves.  It is substantially larger than the interior of the Paradox, much like the Enigma460 is today.  That said, paradox is a much nicer boat, but with CR's the Robbsboat would come very close from the waters perspective.
