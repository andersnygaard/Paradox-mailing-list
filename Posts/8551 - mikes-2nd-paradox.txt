My daughter and I went to the '2015 Port Aransas PlyWooden Boat Festival and Mike Beebe gave us the grand tour of his second Paradox. There are pictures at 'Mike's 2nd Paradox' album.

A few years ago Mike offered to let me climb into his 1st Paradox during the '2012 Texas 200 at a place called Hap's Cut. Hap's Cut has a reputation for it's mud, and even though I really wanted to try on a real Paradox; I knew it wouldn't be right to track a bunch of Hap's Cut mud into Mike's home for the week. So when I saw him recently and the ground was dry, I'm pretty sure I invited myself. Mike let my daughter and I check it out. I do feel a little bad, since we did mess his bed up a bit.

Mike builds the kind of boats that I think are perfect. He modestly calls it workboat finish. He builds boats that are tuff and made to use and enjoy. This new one has some interesting modifications from the standard plans:

- He built hatches for the throughways in bulkhead #2 & #4. If I recall the hatch for bulkhead #4 doubles as the cockpit seat. I can imagine how the hatch for bulkhead #2 could be used as a table.

- He widened the forward portion of the portside shelf so that it meets the vent trunk. So instead of the shelf being rectangular, it is more triangular.

- Like on his first Paradox, the coachroof is removable. He has a tiller that is ran above the aft deck. The mast is metal (1st one was a flagpole. This one maybe too?). Also, he has a simplified tack-strop/spooling arrangement.

- The subfloor is all locker instead of having water ballast tanks.

- He has a combination of seat cushions that can be rearranged as either a recliner or a bed.

- Also, he used a real boot on the mast to act as a leather chafe guard for the boom and sail. Nice touch.

Well that was some of things I can recall.

Mike it was good to see you again. Thanks for the tour. Look forward to sailing side by side when I finally finish mine (sometime down the road).

Most Respectfully,
Bobby
