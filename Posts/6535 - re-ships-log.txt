I started a blog to post the diary of my build for the Paradox. First off
I know very little about building boats. Secondly, I know less about blogs,
or even what a blog is.

I do know I have found the information posted by this group, and the sites
established by Paradox builders, to be most helpful. I doubt, I would have
taken this path without the bread crums left behind by others. Again thanks
for leading the way, and sharing your journeys.

So I wanted to return the favor of previous builders, add to the map for
future builders (more likely what not to do), and also document the project
for myself.

The link is http://okieboat.blogspot.com/

I just set it up. It only has one post. I even have my doubts as to whether
the settings allow the public to view it. It takes me forever to get into it,
even from my new gmail account. If someone does try, and is not allowed to
view it; please let me know, so I can play with the settings.

Works ok for me.

You do realize how dangerous this is, don't you? Now everyone will be 
able to see when you start to backslide and go for a drink instead of 
sanding off the excess epoxy :-)

Keep up the good work!

Hoping for calm nights
