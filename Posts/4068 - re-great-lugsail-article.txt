So what sort of lug sail would you say a paradox carries? is it a standing lug or a balanced lug or a dipping lug?

The tack of the sail goes forward of the mast, as in a dipping or balanced lug, and is fastened to the deck forward of the mast, as in a dipping lug. However it is not a dipping lug, as it isn't dipped on tacking. A balanced lug usually has the boom fastened to the mast and a standing lug has the tack fastened at the mast so it can't be either of those.

So what is the Paradox sail?
