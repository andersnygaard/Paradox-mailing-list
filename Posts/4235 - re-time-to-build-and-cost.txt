Subject: Re: Time to build and cost?

Robbsboat looks like a nice boat, but it resembles Paradox only superficially, in my opinion. Jim Michalak evidently does not believe that chine runners actually work, and theorizes that Matt Layden is primarily a downwind sailor who is willing to spend weeks in port waiting for the right wind. This does not seem to be the case, according to several folk who would be in a position to know. Glen Maxwell's build of Paradox, the elegant Zoe, sails quite well to windward, a fact Glen went to some trouble to document.

In any case, as much as I admire the Michalak portfolio, Paradox is a blind spot in this fine designer's world view. I'm sure even the best have such blind spots. Look, for example, at Bolger's catamarans, which ignore the accumulated wisdom of multihull designers, and as a consequence are not among his better designs. It's a shame, too, because Michalak has already taken the lowly leeboard from ineffective nuisance to pretty-good foil. I can't help wondering how far he might advance the use of horizontal foils, were he able to accept that they work.
