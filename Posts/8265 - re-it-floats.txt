Don't despair. It took me months to reach what I felt was an adequate performance. Practice, practice, practice.

It is easier to practice near the shore, out at sea there is no stationary reference and it feels you aren't moving at all.

I originally built the yuloh to the plans, but I felt that I wasn't putting energy into the water as well as I should so I changed the gearing by moving the pivot hole about 100mm nearer the handle. Now I can feel when I am doing some work and that makes it easier to control the boat.

Lots of people ask me to let them try the yuloh and I have found the best way is to tell them to move the handle in a horizontal line at shoulder height and to preform 4 clear actions: twist, push, twist, pull. Once they get the hang of it this morphs into a much more fluid motion.

You have got the rudder up, haven't you?  

Looks like an interesting area, In a couple of years you will be sailing over to the Sir Joseph Banks group of islands (100km?) and perhaps round the Spencer Gulf shore. Ideal Paradox country.
