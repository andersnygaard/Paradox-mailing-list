Subject: Bulkhead side curves

Bulkhead 1 has an offset of 5mm in its side.
Bulkhead 2 has an offset of 7mm in its side.
Bulkhead 3 has an offset of 5mm in its side.

Bulkhead 4 and the transom show no offset. I assume these two have straight sides. Anyone have trouble getting the plywood sides to bend like this? Does the side nail up nicely to the bulkheads?

I imagine this curve to the side gives a lot of stiffness to the plywood sides.
