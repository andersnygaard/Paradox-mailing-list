Well, I have been using IBM CADAM (2D drafting) at work for the past 15(?) years, but am just starting to use CATIA (3D). I have done a one week training course and have had the terminal on my desk for about 2 months.

A while ago I tried using Autocad on my machine at home but couldn't get on with it. My approach to design seems to match well with the way CADAM works, but Autocad seems to approach everything from the other side.

What I have learned is that you should have a good idea of what you want to be able to do with the software, then concentrate on learning how to use those functions and ignore the other 101 functions. When you are proficient with the basics *then* expand into other functions.

Hi Al,

This is very nice work! Congratulations!
I've printed out some of the views, they are amazingly "real".
I am still learning to work with CAD and find it not at all easy to learn. It seems I'm lacking patience..Do you have any idea how many hours it took to get this far?

Best regards,
Bert.

Hoping for calm nights
