Didn't he say that the boat weighed about 130 lbs?  Add 250 for crew,
round off to 400-- that's less than a third the displacemnt of
Paradox.  The sail looked some smaller, but not that much smaller, so
I'm sure you're right.

Looking at the pictures of the runners, it struck me that they were
placed on the chines in a way similar to the way low aspect ratio
keels might be applied to the keel, and like LAR keels, they ended
abruptly at the aft edge, though faired into the chine at the forward
end.  I mention this because I wonder how best to place chine runners
in relation to sail CofE.  Should you treat the area of the runners as
a keel extension, in determining the center of lateral plane?

BTW, I finally ordered the Paradox plans.  I'm looking forward to
getting a firsthand look.
