about the salt on windows, what about using one of those magnetic fish tank cleaners? kinda corny im sure but doesnt require electricity and wont have to open up the top and reach around to wipe the window if its raining. could just put one on each window. they come in diffrent sizes and have to look to make sure it will work with the thickness of window that you are using.
