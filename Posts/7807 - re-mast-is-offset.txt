Do you mean for sleeping, or for storage? If for sleeping, perhaps you could cut down the opening to the forward compartment so that it is flush with the sole as Al has done with his "Little Jim" so that he could stow his bicycle. That way, your feet could stick through.

Without ventilation, you may find that your ports fog up if you have to close the hatch for bad weather.
