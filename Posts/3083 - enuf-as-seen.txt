Subject: Enuf as seen

Meant to add to my reply to David that I went out to stroke Enuf the other morning and found her wearing a pair of spectacles!

Investigation revealed that one early rising neighbour had found them in the grass outside my house and another had fitted them to the hull.

Makes me wonder about painting an eye on the front like the Portugese fishing boats do.
Enuf donated the specs to an African charity.

Two current pics added to my folder which is nearly full. Where do I put subsequent pics?

Cheers... hoping to finish the mast today....... Derek
