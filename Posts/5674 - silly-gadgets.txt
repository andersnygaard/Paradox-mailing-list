My persistant daydream about Ironsides is to make a human powered outboard motor for it. The only alerations to the hull I will allow myself for this is for bolt holes in the transome and some holes for a drive system too. I already have an old junk outboard motor,(three actually) to work with. I also have a huge three bladed nickel-bronze propeller 16 inch diameter by 14 inch pitch. I got this for next to nothing at a yard sale. Putting the propeller on the outboard and the outboard onto the transome is simple. 

Making a sliding/rolling pedal frame to (quickly and temporarily) clamp onto the cabin sole will not be hard to do. Arranging two ropes to run thru pulleys to go to the outboard will be worked out later. This is just my general scheme at the moment. I would like to have the two foot pedals slide back and forth in a traight line parallel to the floor. I hope to use this either from the floor sitting, or up on the bench sitting, position. Of coarse it must be able to unclamp from the sole and be put away somewhere. I have a recumbent bicycle which has made me understand sitting and pedaling in a circular motion. I don't like this type of pedaling much. So This has "molded" my thinking into the above outline. 

How to arrange the two ropes to turn the vertical drive shaft I will work out later. And if I want a reverse or not. We'll see. After all I have all winter to tinker on it and not much to loose.
