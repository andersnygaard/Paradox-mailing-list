Thanks Derek, It's shown on one of the diagrams published on the internet as a little compartment with items in it - like it was a little shopping basket.

Sounds like that is artistic licence and getting stuff in and out is impractical. 

That sounds like a certain persons picture and is probably copyrighted, meaning that we are not allowed to discuss it :0)

Your idea of using it as emergency floatation is ok , except that if it was used in earnest the boat would float bow up and stern down.
The poor survivor would have to sit on the stem awaiting rescue. Still that's better than sinking ain't it.

I wouldn't worry which way it floated so long as it did. My intention, which I hope never to test, is to stay in the boat. If it floats with the water at deck level you are still better staying in it than getting out.
