Hi Jeff,

- an afterthought

- There is a free office suite program that operates on a wide variety of computers and platforms - Windows, Mac, Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD.

- It can read and write lots of different files including Microscoft, and can import DXF based Computer Aided Design (CAD) files. It has a good drawing module as well.
