Subject: Re: Appox build time, plans, cost??

<p>I just got the PDF version of the plans from Dave Boulduc while I wait for the post office to deliver the plans.&nbsp; They must be stuck somewhere along the way since Dave said I should have gotten them by now.</p>

<p>Anyway, without copying all the materials list (copyright?) here is what was stated for the plywood:</p>

<p>Plywood- Exterior AC or Marine-</p>
<p>1 sheet 6 mm (¼)</p>
<p>3 sheets 9 mm (3/8")</p>
<p>4 sheets 12 mm (½")</p>
<p>2 sheets 18 mm (¾)</p>

<p>And for the bronze ring nails:</p>
<p>Bronze ring nails</p>
<p>1" #14=1 lb</p>
<p>1 ¼" #12= 3 lb</p>
<p>1 ½" #10 = 2 lb</p>
<p>2" #10 =2 lb</p>
<p>2 ½" # 10 = 2 lb.</p>

<p>There are lots more parts but that should give you an idea of some of the materials needed for the Paradox.</p>

<p>Along with the above, the material list calls for 5-7 gallons of epoxy which is another big cost to figure on.</p>
