Subject: Re: 'Faith' was launched today.

Congratulations Bill.

On the yuloh front, I too launched, for the first time, in a cross wind and managed to leave green paint on the end of every finger pontoon on the downwind side of the marina.

In case you hadn't realised yet, it is much easier to steer, when using the yuloh, if the rudder is up. Other than that it is just a mater of practice.

Hoping for calm nights
