Subject: Building a Paradox (pictures)

I have been slowly building my Paradox now for over a year. I am expecting to have it in the water next summer (the Gods and Wife permitting). In the mean time I have collected together some photos of the construction and put them on display at:

The site is a bit rough and ready (like my woodwork) but I don't get much time for this, what with a boat to build and all.....

Hoping for calm nights
