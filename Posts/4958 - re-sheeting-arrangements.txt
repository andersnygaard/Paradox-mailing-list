That's better. Glen is using the Mk2 sail isn't he? Does that have a 
shorter boom than my Mk1 arrangement?

One easy solution to the fouling may be to fit a pushpit which lifts 
and guides the sheet over the motor.

I'd still be interested to hear Glen's comments on his sheeting 
arrangement and whether it helps stop the fouling on his vane gear, 
which is a lot more obtrusive than a motor.

The bit of the vane gear which could get tangled is aft of the boom 
end so the sheet won't come into contact with it.
