Thanks Nels.

Can I take it then that the chine logs and sheers are just for the fasteners? 
I'm not sure that you're are correct about fastening into ply. I believe that I read, a long while ago, that fasteners in wood are effective by virtue of the end grain acting against the inserted fastener. Hence driving a screw or nail into end grain just pushes the fibres aside and gives a poor fastening. Ply is a series of end grains at different angles to each other providing lots of effective fastening. If, however, I am wrong in this belief somebody please let me know because it could end up with serious repercussions for me.

Here in the middle of Old England fir tends to mean a pine that is straght grown, at speed in the Baltic states, is poorly seasoned and is used for general house building. Occasionally, it is possible to find some boards with a reddish grain that always seem to be Russian sourced and are a bit more durable. I have ordered Douglas Fir for the mast and spars, but all DF has a two week delay for unplaned and a hefty delivery charge. The yuloh and toe rails I will make from locally available fir, but split and laminated to prevent warping.

I would appreciate further input on this subject. Perhaps I should add that I am 56 years old and if the boat lasts 15 years it will probably be long enough!

Finally, I've just got back from watching Al Law sailing "Little Jim'; inspiring!
