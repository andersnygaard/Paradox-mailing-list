Subject: Re: Vent Trunk

Mine is the same as David's except the whole side panel can be removed. No leaks so far. In actual fact, the drain hole under the mast step is above the water line. I've been out in some rough stuff when waves have constantly washed over the foredeck causing water to flow into the vent box - again, no problems.

Dave has answered the other questions.

Cheers,
Bill.
