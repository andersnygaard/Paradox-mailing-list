Subject: Re: Paradoxes afloat...warped micro

Hey Paul-

I was the guy looking at the runners on my micro, but finally realized it wouldn't fly. After warping my keel in a basement flooding disater i was really pissed as i never really was stoked about the draft. I kicked the leeboard idea around but they looked funny and didn't quite fit the hull shape. Alas, i built a sweet birdwatcher off centerboard case up against the port bunk.

It is flush to the top of the bunk 2.25 inches wide and 4 foot long....i.e. takes up next to no interior space. I stuck my ballast under the sole and under the bunks (425lbs of lead shot and epoxy mixed and poured like concrete into the low part of the hull then ply screwed over the top).

With the board down you don't know it's there.....with it up....only when beached or on the trailer it just partitions the forward half of the port bunk. It's really out of the way.

The rudder is a mouted as normal but off a skeg (was the keel) now from the hull belly back. Have a huge endplate on the rudder to hopefully make up for it lossing 6 inches of depth....the as19 has a smaller rudder than this so it should be ok.

Hope to launch over the turkey day vacation maybe it will work.....maybe not.
