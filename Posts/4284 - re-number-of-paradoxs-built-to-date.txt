Hi Perry,

I live in Mississippi and am down that way all the time with Whisper (Pirates Cove Ala). I also sail the Tenn-Tom. Will be glad to drop by and do some sailing.

I will also be going to Cedar Key the end of the month. I plan on getting there a few days early, and  will be going thru your area on the way. I might can leave even earlier if you want to get together and have a sail.
