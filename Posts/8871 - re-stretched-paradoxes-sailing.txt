Subject: Re: Stretched Paradoxes Sailing?

generally the advantage a sloop has going to windward is the long clean luff of the Genoa if you can keep a tight enough head stay. That requires backstays and side stays, which means the main can only be sheeted out so far. You can overcome this with a spinnaker or a big genoa, but no you need a pole on the clew. Any unstayed lug can be sheeted out 90 degrees or more, making it hugely effective on a broad reach or a run with no extra sails or complexity. As to the chinese junk, you should see what's been done now that they're sewing camber into the panels and with the split junks. One sail, just run it up or down like a venetian blind to adjust your power. You overestimate the effect of the mast on the "bad tack" in practice the effect is minimal. Some have even found that they go to windward better on that tack due to the slightly flatter camber in the sail.

You want to see boat hauling ass with a lug?
