Subject: chine runners

As I understand it, no one is quite sure exactly how the chine runners used on Paradox work to prevent leeway upwind. What I'm wondering is this: does anyone know if the flat bottom of Paradox is an essential element of the success of this technology?

I ask because this technology was tried many years ago by Wharram builders. He called them "vortex generators." In general, the reaction of other designers was a big collective giggle, from which I infer that they were not altogether successful. But the hulls of a Wharram cat as about as different from the hull of Paradox as could be imagined-- narrow V shapes.

Purveyors of conventional wisdom would no doubt be horrified by flat-bottomed cat hulls, but a small lugrigged minimal cruising cat wouldn't suffer terribly from flat bottoms, I think. Flat bottoms would increase the usable volume and load-carrying capacity of the cat a lot, and decrease the draft. There are even historic precedents for that sort of hull. I believe Nathaniel Herreshoff's Amaryllis had flat-bottomed hulls-- the hulls looked a lot like those plywood troughs used to mix cement, back before redimix. And that boat (gaff-rigged) was so fast that cats were banned from competing in the races of the day.

BTW, lug is not an inherently slow rig. There were once lug-rigged racing yachts in England, and they did very well against the gaff-rigged conventional racers of the day.  

So, does anyone know if flat bottoms are necessary for chine runners to be effective?
