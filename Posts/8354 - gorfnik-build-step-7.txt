I forgot to mention that before putting on the deck and painting the inside, I had also installed two 3/8 inch (interior) by 8 inch aluminium tubing right through port and starboard flotation chambers to accommodate the two 10 inch 3/8 inch stainless steel bolts which will be the two leeboard pivots. This idea comes from Scott Widmier and prevents water from ever entering the flotation chambers; if water gets in the tube, it will be led to the inside of the boat instead.

In practice, there is so little space between the tubing and the bolt that not a drop of water has never entered the boat through that ultra thin 8 inch long gap.
