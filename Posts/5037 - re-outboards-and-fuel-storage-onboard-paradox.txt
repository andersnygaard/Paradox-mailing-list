Are you suggesting fuel tanks built in to the hull? I personally 
wouldn't do that, but I see no reason not to make a couple of vented 
bins, to put cans in, as Pete is doing. As long as you don't foul the 
tiller it would make good use of a space which is difficult to get at 
as designed.

I did consider something vaguely similar for anchor stowage, but the 
ergonomics of lifting a heavy anchor while bent over and reaching at 
full stretch decide me against it.

The only drawback I can see is that access to the bins through the deck will be hindered by the stowed yuloh and sail/boom.
