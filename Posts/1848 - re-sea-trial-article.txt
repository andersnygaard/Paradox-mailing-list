I tried (on land) without a topping lift. It is possible, but the topping 
lift makes it much simpler, with a lot less heaving.

My topping lift is a lot simpler than Glen's.

The other query I have is about using a topping lift. Matt seems to get along without one. What is the experience of others with, or without topping lifts?

Cheers,
