Regarding plywood.. I read in some building forums that exterior plywood and marine plywood use the same glue now. The difference lies in the number of voids inside the layers. Marine ply is supposed to have fewer voids, but I have heard of complaints of horrible marine plywood of late. I think one can do well using A/C grade exterior ply as it has no surface voids to speak of... and paint it both sides with epoxy as you build.

I am refurbishing a 24ft pocket cruiser now and am doing it in that manner with exterior A/C Plywood, because I am on a tight budget as well.. The previous owner did not coat with epoxy and so dryrot has started to attack my cabinets and bulkheads.

It took me about 18 months working an hour or so each evening after 

work, and some time most weekends.

I built using marine ply, but Matt built the original in exterior ply 

and it is about 20 years old now and still going strong. I believe 

one has been built using mainly salvaged wood.

I doubt if anyone has worked out a handicap figure.

Dave has pointed you towards a picture. 

Note that if the side bins are left out or modified then there would 

be a couple of more inches each side at the shoulders. If the 

insulation is also left out there that gives you another couple of 

inches each side.



However, I think, for 2 people to spend more than a weekend on board 

you would both need to be very tidy and organised.
