Hi,

All you builders of Paradox and you dreamers too, I thought you may be interested in a new user group, so here are the details:

If you don't already know about http://www.irbs.com (I'd rather be sailing), then I suggest you may like to pay a visit to their bulletin boards, in particular to the newly established Small Sailboats Usergroup set up in conjunction with http://www.smallsailboats.co.uk.

The purpose of the Usergroup is to have a venue where people can meet to present their views about small sailing boats 26 ft LOA and under, of any configuration - monohull or multihull.

It's hoped discussions will ensue about the merits of small sailing boats, their use, building, cruising, handling techniques, types, rigs, auxiliary engines, cruising grounds, rallies, messabouts and you name it, providing topics are about small boats that use at least one sail for propulsion.

I hope you will come onboard for some enjoyable exchanges.

Bill.
