Subject: Front Deck

Hi all,

I am having trouble getting the front deck to fit. I can't get it to curve enough. I have cut across bulkhead two and got that bit fixed and am now wondering whether to cut it across bulkhead one as well to end up with three smaller parts.

I have tried webbing straps and windlasses but still no luck. I am also thinking about cutting grooves along the length to encourage it to bend. Before I go that route though has anybody any thoughts and ideas?

Cheers,
Derek
