Subject: Re: Bending Brass

Hi Derek, 

Sounds like the brass is work hardening, meaning, from working the metal 
it becomes hard, and that makes it become brittle and it snaps. of 
course depends on the type of brass, ie its makeup. there is a website 
that has the info you are looking for, I would do a search for 
anvilfire, or just braze it. some research should answer the questions. 
there is prob a temp that the brass aneals "becomes soft" again, but im 
not sure off hand.
