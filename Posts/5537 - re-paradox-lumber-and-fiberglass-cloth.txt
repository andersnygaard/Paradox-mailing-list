Subject: Re: Paradox lumber and fiberglass cloth

In regards to fiberglass, I have been happy with this combination- 4 oz glass on the topsides, 6 oz on the sides and several layers of 10 oz on the bottom. I like 10 oz glass instead of the woven roving for the bottom because I think it is easier to finish. On Little Cruiser I used 5 layers of 10 oz on the bottom, but if I were to do it again I would have done only 3-4 layers.  For swamp thing I used 2 layers of 10 oz on the bottom, and Matt used the same amount on Enigma. I think for Paradox you will probably need a minimum of 15 yards of 10 oz, 8 yards of 6 oz and 8 yards of 4 oz. Of course I would buy extra so you have enough to do the rudder/blade and mast.
