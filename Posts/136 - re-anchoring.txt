Subject: [paradoxbuilders] Anchoring.

I had considered this for my own Paradox, and had decided to use a system that worked on a previous (motor) boat. It is similar to Glen's idea except that you start with a permanent bow rope, long enough to reach the steering position, with a sturdy snap hook on the end. This is kept snapped onto a hard point by the steerer and can be used, when underway, as a running line for a safety harness. When anchoring the anchor is dropped over from the steering position and the correct scope paid out. Once it is dug in the anchor line is made fast to the snap hook with a clove hitch. Further line is paid out till the bow line takes the strain. The anchor line can then be cleated off on the stern cleat 'just to make sure'.

This worked fine with a motor boat, my only worry is that when you weigh anchor you will end up stern-on to the wind. This *may* make setting sail awkward, however as I am not experienced with sailing boats of this size I am open to criticism.
