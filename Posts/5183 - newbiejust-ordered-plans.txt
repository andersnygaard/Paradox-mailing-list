Subject: newbie...just ordered plans

Hi all,

My name is Rod Cannon and I live in Venice, California. I just ordered the plans for Paradox after weeks of deliberation over it or the "Black Skimmer" design. I chose Paradox hands down cause I am a bit of a gadget gizmo man and this craft is wonderous!

I will begin building in the fall and preparing to sail in the summer of 09'. I was a Professional Magician (specializing in micro-magic...heh) for over 20 yrs. and I am an avid electronics geek. I want to apologize now for any cockamanie idea I come up with that is not feasable, be easy as I am new to boats and boating. (presently taking navigation and sailing classes in Marina Del Rey to get certified,) I plan on using this boat for very short distances next year until I feel capable. 

I have a couple of ideas to share later as to the electrical system in Paradox, but right now I was wondering if anybody has thought of using an electric motor instead of gasoline?

I know a trolling motor might not be enough power but teck has gotton better and I have seen all kinds of Micro-generators new to the market that might run an electric motor using way less gas than a standard. (a reg. genny 1000w will run approx 6hrs. on a gal. of gas)

I found a seylar trolling motor for under $100 dollars on net that give 18 lbs. of thrust, I dont know enough yet about the subject but is this enough to move Paradox at least 3 knts?
