Hi Erik,

I would find it very interesting to see someone building a CF mast for the dox. The only time the weight of the wooden mast is a problem is when stepping and unstepping the mast.

I usually stand on the deck while the dox is on the trailer and set the mast and reverse the process when removing the mast. The heavy wooden mast sometimes makes it awkward to manage while I am standing on the deck. Less weight would be more, or I need to pump iron.

I have a larger boat that has free standing carbon fiber/s glass construction and they are designed to flex in order to spill air during puffs. Based on my experience with masts I would prefer to have the stiffness of the wooden mast on the dox. Perhaps CF mast can be made to not flex, but it is the saving in weight of CF that is attractive to me. I suspect more research is needed regarding the CF.

Let us know how you go.
