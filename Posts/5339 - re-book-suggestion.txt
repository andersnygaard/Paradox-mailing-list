Thanks for the link. Ahhhh ya... It was you who put the idea of a paradox going to Hawaii in my mind Mark. Lol... I was gonna putter around in my Paradox for a few yrs and If the urge to go was still there build a "Swaggie" and take it. But your suggestion that a paradox might be capable of such a trip if well planned... well... I feel the ember ignited in the very back of my mind. Who knows.... ? I do plan on using the boat alot though and can easily see myself sailing to the Bahamas after it is built to attend a "Paracon".

If you want a chance to take a look at the contents of Self-Steering Under Sail online here is the link to a pdf copy.

I found this book to be good on theory and helps you understand the various commercial systems available. As for building your own it doesn't offer any step by step instructions but would be good from a 'reverse engineering' perspective.

I agree that the idea of a national Paradox meet would be appealing - unless you're already in Hawaii Rod!
