A little help please. I suck at boatbuilding. I half suck at woodworking, and double suck at all the rest that goes into building a boat. Oh and I quadruple suck at anything involving metal.

Here is what I think. Please tell me if I'm anywhere near the track, much less on-track:

Q1) What type of adhesive holds the copper water pipe into the boom? Or should it not be glued at all?

Q2) I don't know what 464 naval brass is, but I'm assuming this rod can be machined with a Dremel tool?

Q3) The end of the brass rod that sticks into the copper pipe, will need a 5mm groove, 5mm from the end of the rod; which will receive a stop screw? This grove can be cut with a Dremel tool?

Q4) The end of the brass rod that is bolted to a 1/4" standard brass pipe will need to be split in half? The rod can be split in half with a Dremel tool or a hacksaw?

Q5) The split ends of the brass rod are then bent into a V-shape, and a 1/4" hole is drilled into them to receive a 1/4" bolt. A high speed drill bit will be able to do this? Again, I haven't worked with this brass before.

Q6) Before all the above happens, the brass rod must be bent. The best time to bend it is before it is cut to size? Should I take it to a muffler shop for the bending? Or should I use a long steel pipe as cheater bar? Would a conduit bender work?

Q7) How on earth is the thimble (Thank God Duckworks sells those too; otherwise I would have been shopping at sewing store; not kidding.) seized to the swivel rod (Oh "swivel rod", that's what this thing-a-ma-bob is called.)? Or maybe even better, How on earth would I attach the Racelite #201 block to the swivel rod?

Q8) The tack strop spacer pipe made of 1/4" brass schedule .40 (standard) pipe will be easier or harder to work with than the brass swivel rod discussed above?
