Considering the total your going to spend and the amount of labor your going to put in to the build I can't see using less then marine grade. Sure if you totally encapsulate some A-C exterior grade but you'll be dealing with knots, voids and generally less finished surface. There are places to economize, IMHO the hull is not the place! Just my 2cents:)
