Subject: Re: boat plans

I ordered my plans last week and recieved them the other day. I was a little surprised to find that the measurments are mostly in metric. I can't even start to visualize until I convert the measurments. But I like that the boat building procedure is along the lines of how traditiional sharpies were built. 

A couple of questions on the chine and sheer are the bevels cut before installing or shaped after there installed? Are they beveled on top and bottom of each log? Are the bulkheads beveled where are the demensions or are they bevel angles taken during the building procedure? I have built three small boats stitch and glue one boat from cratch a pacific proa, ply on frames/bulkheads, And another scratch built hull in the building proccess for my micro cruising proa. None with chine logs or sheer logs.

Jack , Hows the stitch and glue version going any new pictures of your progress? 

Thanks,
Todd
