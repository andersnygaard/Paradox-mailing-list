Welcome aboard.


While the building is quite lengthy, it would be very difficult to 
get it irrevocable wrong.


Paradox is not a dinghy, you sail it like a yacht. Except in confined 
waters the technique is to cleat off the sheet and rudder and 
concentrate on the view (or read a book).


Remove any stores that will object and roll it on it's side (you 
might have to remove the ballast as well, it depends how strong you 
are).


The bottom is made from 18mm ply with 4mm epoxy/glass on the outside. 
it will stand much rougher treatment than any production boat


I have a plastic beach inflatable that I got for just this reason. In 
3 years it has never even been inflated.


That's what your bailer is for. It is no use for anything else as 
there is never enough water in the bottom to need it.


Last week I went out on Chew Valley lake with someone from Bath who 
is thinking of building. He has been sailing dinghies for 40 years 
and said he had not believed about the hands-off sailing till he was 
actually doing it. He also didn't believe, until he saw it, that I 
could launch it, park the trailer and get aboard without getting my 
feet (or the trailer wheels) wet (the slipway has no pontoon).


Pop down sometime and see what it is all about.


Hoping for calm nights
