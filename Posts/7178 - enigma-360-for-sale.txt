Subject: Enigma 360 for sale

Just thought I'd give people a heads up that there is a partially completed Enigma 360 with hard top available for sale in Fort Pierce. For those who read my earlier post stating that a PARADOX was for sale, I have to report that I was mistaken. The small picture in the classified section of SMALL CRAFT ADVISOR 76 fooled me. I guess it was the perspective and the hard cabin. Anyways, the hull was built by Don McGregor, a well known professional boat builder in Florida. This ENIGMA is about 85/90% complete, and Don is selling it because he has developed health issues and now does not have the energy to finish the project. His son Lew, a long time acquaintance of ours, has said that his dad is motivated to sell the little boat. He is asking $2800 which includes a trailer and materials to finish the spars. The builder can be reached by phone at 772-332-8689. He doesn't have email so if you can't call then I can pass along any messages to his son.
