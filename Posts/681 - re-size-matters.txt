Ernie, If you need me to take any measurements from Whisper, let me know. Good luck!!

Thanks, David,

I appreciate the encouragement. I'm guessing it will also be alright 
to raise the hatch cover for a bit more headroom.

Okay, now I've run out of excuses for not building Paradox.

I'm going to re-read everything, including all the posts on this 
great forum and then get to work.
