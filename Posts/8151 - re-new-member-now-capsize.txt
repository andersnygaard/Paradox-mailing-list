If the sail is furled and the furling line and the halyard has no excessive slack and both cleated, then the mast is locked in position by these ropes.. For the mast to escape from the vent box it would have to break the halyard line or cleat. Or If the furled sail unrolled then the halyard would be slack and allow the mast to escape .

The same applies while the sail is raised fully or partly, as long as the lines are safely cleated.

Best,
Jim
