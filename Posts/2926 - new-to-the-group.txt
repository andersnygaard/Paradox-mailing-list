Subject: new to the group.....

Hey guys/gals,

Thought I'd show face(so to speak) here since I'm new to the board. Found this cute little boat called the Paradox, and quickly fell in love. As such I've read a boatload (no pun) of info so far on the net. Still lurking for more...

Just got done writting an e-mail for a set of plans. Hopefully a fast responce will come back,as I'm very eger(sp?) to start the build. All of the fantastic stories has me pumped! I get a rush just reading them....lol.

Looking on the main web site for the Paradox I'm alittle confused. I've seen afew addresses's advertised for plans, and also a helpful booklet for $12.00. Is there any way of combining all of this to just one addy, and one price? Any idea's on the shipping time's?

Well in anycase....pleasure to meet you all. Hope to share the building experience....not to mention more stories :)

Jeff
