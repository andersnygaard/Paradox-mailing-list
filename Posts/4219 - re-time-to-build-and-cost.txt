Subject: Re: Time to build and cost?

I have investigated buying a used boat, but I just really enjoy building things.

I'm also building a 4 wheeled quad cycle from a few junked bikes.  If
I wanted something 'production', then of course there are easier options.

I guess I was just a bit shocked by the time required.  It looks
simpler than it actually is I think.  I think I'm underestimating the
free time I have too.
