Subject: Ridiculous name. . .

Please somebody, build a Paradox and for the name, just give us two ducks in whatever artistic format you'd like.  I'm still years away, Pottering around in my Potter and so forth, so. . ."Pair a ducks" done visually is just too good to skip.
Sorry, I couldn't help it once I thought of it.
