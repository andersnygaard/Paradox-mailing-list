Your new sail looks wonderful, Glen. Looks like more broadseams than specified by Matt. Like Dave, I'm interested in which weight cloth was used. Perhaps it's the light, do you have some telltails just aft of where the sail contacts the mast? (NS8 I think).

I've been trying to work up the huevos to commit to building my sail. I looked for a copy of "The Sailmaker's Apprentice" in the local bookstore, but it appears as though I will have to go to Amazon. Seeing your fine, new example has me hesitating...

Thanks for posting your new pics. Looking good!
