Jeff;

If you can find that article, that would be really awesome! Roger Dongray, the designer, has mentioned that a GG has sailed through Europe on the canal system and then on as far as Turkey and I wonder if the artilcle is about this voyage.

As for pedigree, i'm sure you know that Mr. Dongray was the designer for the Cornish Crabber range of sailboats. By the name of that range, i'd guess that he drew his inspiration from cornish crabbing boats, and the boat resembles to me also the boats from Falmouth that i've read about. Never having sailed any of this sort of craft, I can't comment on her sailing and sea keeping abilities, but i'm very impressed with the huge amount of well organized space below in an under 20' boat. It doesn't hurt either that she is utterly gorgeous (forgive me, i'm in luuuuv <g>).

After they've helped turn the boat etc. the friends are welcome to come for a sail or two, but after that, they'll have to catch me! <g>
