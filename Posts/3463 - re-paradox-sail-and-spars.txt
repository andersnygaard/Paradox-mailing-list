Hi Bill,

The boom is curved so that as the sail is furled for reefing the draft will be removed and the sail sets correctly.

That's as it should work, but why do the plans show one side of the boom curved and the other straight.  I've made my boom as per plan, but it may have been better not to have a curved side.

I'm assuming the problem will remain with my curved boom, when the sail is fully set, and whether the sail is reefed or not, the yard will still bend under its weight and the weight of the sail.  The bending could increase because of the force applied to the the end of the boom by the sheet when the boat is on the wind.
