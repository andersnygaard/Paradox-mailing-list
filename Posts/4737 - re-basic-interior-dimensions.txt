Thank you, Alan, Jeff and Stephen! This is just what was wanted. Headroom is the only other number I'm looking for so far. I'm glad you pointed me to your photos, since they are very instructive. I am most impressed by Jeff's boat, listed as a Paradox/Enigma hybrid. Jeff, where can I find out more about her? Just at a glance, I can see a mod or two in NOLI that interests me: first, the shorter, deeper chine runners, and second, the cut-away after part of the cabin. (Though I suppose it reduces sea-worthiness a bit, I can't imagine a boat that won't let you sit on the aft deck to sail in fine weather. -or is it just to make it easier to get in and out of?)
