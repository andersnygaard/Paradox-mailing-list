does not use one on the original Paradox and in a private email to me
he encouraged me not to use one either!

What were his reasons, Pete? Was it simply that he didn't feel it was 
necessary or was there some technical reason why it is not a good 
idea.

I have tried operating without using the topping lift and have 
decided I am not nearly strong enough.
