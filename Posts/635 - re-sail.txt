Thanks for replying to David on this one Ron, I don't think I want to recommend my sail maker as there are some things about it that I am not satisfied with. 
David, I saw an article in Messing About in Boats some time last year about a small boat with a lug sail and in the article a sail maker was mentioned who "Did magic with these little sails", a quick search of my back issues did not turn up the article but I didn't spend much time at it. If you get the magazine, I would recommend a search of your own.
