Subject: Ohio Version of Everglades Challenge

Hello to everyone,

I'm interested in having a mini watertribe type of event up here in Ohio. What we are planning is a multi-checkpoint challenge for small boats on one of our big lakes up here, possibly Ceasar Creek Lake near Harveysburg OH. We will keep it simple with probably more relaxed rules than watertribe and no entrance fee. It should be much easier to coordinate something like that up here because the risk factor is much much lower than something the caliber of the everglades challenge. Please if you are in our neighborhood, or even if you aren't, email me at robb@microcruiser.com and maybe we can get this off the ground. Something like this could be a lot of fun.

Thanks,
Robb
