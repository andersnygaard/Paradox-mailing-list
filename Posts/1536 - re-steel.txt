Nels,
I've seen steel boats as small as 9 feet in Holland, and multi-chined, too, not just boxy prams.  At 14 feet the Paradox is unquestionably suitable for steel construction.  Again, my educated guess would be that 12 gauge (.10") would be fine as long as there are some stringers added to the frames.
