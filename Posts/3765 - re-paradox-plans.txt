Subject: Re: Paradox Plans

I would certainly consider adding chine runners (Try it with or without the leeboard) and the Paradox sail rig. Maybe a steel plate on the bottom instead of internal ballast? I would not attempt any big jumps off-shore until I learned it's capabilities. That reefing system of Matt's makes it as safe as a lifeboat if the hatches are all closed up. "Cork in a bottle." is what Bolger refers to it as a storm strategy. Robbsboat actually has more interior sleeping room than Paradox! It would certainly be faster and cheaper to build. Not as strong or heavy, which is another disadvantage for off-shore jaunts. Could be in big ka ka if you hit something or vice versa. Geeze I just about talked myself into building one myself:-P
