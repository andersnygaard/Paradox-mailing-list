My paradox has a Honda 3hp air cooled outboard. The pro=E2=80=99s are fairly obvious. It can drive the boat at about 5.5 knots so lack of wind ceases to be an issue and it=E2=80=99s useful for where I usually launch in a shallow and narrow creek where sailing upwind would be near impossible.

But there are of course negatives. The biggest issue is the sheet snagging the outboard during a gybe. I=E2=80=99ve seen a number of solutions for that. Another paradox in Brisbane has a crane type set up out the back of the boat to avoid fouling

In my case I shortened a yacht stanchion and sheet from the top of the post.

Either system stops the fouling as the sheeting point is above the motor.

Weight distribution doesn=E2=80=99t seem to be much of an issue, but fuel storage is. The minimum sized refill tank is awkward to store, and I don=E2=80=99t like having it inside the boat. It partly solved the problem by attacking the plastic bottle with a heat gun and reshaped it so it was a bit squashed and able to stand upright in a small spot I had for it.

I=E2=80=99m about to replace the motor with an epropulsion spirit. It=E2=80=99s about the same H/power but is heaps lighter and has no fuel storage issues. You can get a model that recharges off the propeller spin but a paradox doesn=E2=80=99t sail fast enough to really use that feature, so I=E2=80=99ll get the solar recharge kit. And the real plus of an electric outboard is that it can cure the only real vice of a paradox - poor tacking. Before I tack I will simply press the =E2=80=9Con=E2=80=9D button - tack - and hit the off button. No noise, about 3G seconds battery drainage and no more fluffing the tack and being caught in irons.
