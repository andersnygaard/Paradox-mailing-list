Subject: Re: The Official Potty Line

One of the problem you create laws is that you have to find and pay someone to enforce them.

Here in Florida the Coast Guard does not get real serious about being toilet inspectors. Apparently they do not like the job. It is probably not as exciting as chasing down drug smugglers.

California I hear has gone quite psychotic on the subject and has basically tweaked the laws so that it quickly becomes economically prohibative to live aboard or make an extended stay in California waters.

Turkey on the other hand apparently shares the fines with there citizens if the citizens report direct dumping from someone in a yacht. The fines are hefty if you are an American.

Unfortunately, people who live aboard sailboats and even more so the people who cruise in a Paradox do not have the money to support large lobbying efforts in Washington. 

Beware of the laws regarding this subject and how they are actually implimented where ever you sail. It would be something to find out before you cruise in a new area.
