Subject: Re: Enuf's Calamity Update &amp; the Yard

0500 hours (guess who has trouble sleeping through problems) and the hull surface seems slightly less tacky. If I touch it I can still get a fingerprint but if I lightly drag my fingers across it the surface changes from shiny to matt. Where I brushed on neat hardener it doesn't seem any different.

Met my son on the way to the bathroom and he asked if we are putting another coat on when it dries! Has he never heard of tempting fate? What do they teach kids in school today? Next time I do a hull I'll sheath in copper!!

Anyway, now for my next question.

The boom is shaped to allow the sail to wrap itself around it neatly when furled. However, because I have a mk2 sail it won't be that neat anyway :0I

Why is the yard shaped?

Why can't I use a constant diameter bamboo, for instance, which would give a lot less weight aloft? Do I need weight in the yard for some reason that I have missed?

I'll get on with the yard while I await your wisdom and maybe save myself a piece of Douglas Fir for another project.

Thanks all  .......  Derek
