I'm thinking it is the pipe that the tack strop feeds through - called a spacer pipe on the plans. Might get bent under stress?

The only failure I had. I tried to do a cheep job on the strut without fully appreciating the loads it had to transmit. It bent!

The "swivel rod" is a part that I have wondered about. It is held in place inside the end of the boom by that single #10 stop screw?

Actually, in use, it is held in place by gravity (pushing the boom forward) For day or weekend sails I often don't tighten up the screw. It has never shown any signs of wanting to become disconnected.

The biggest concern in my view would be about keeping that roller furling assembly running flawlessly if going a long way in heavy weather. 

Because the boom is always pushing forward on the axle I domed the end of the axle bar. Then I brazed a cap over the end of a length of water pipe and bonded it into the boom (cap end first). The axle is a rattling fit in the pipe and sits against the end cap. With the aid of a smear of grease, it has shown no signs of doing anything except operate perfectly

It will be interesting to see how Sven Yrvind goes about it as he is planning to use this rig on "Yrvind 1/2" which he is building.

Will he go with wood or carbon fiber spars and maybe sealed bearings in the ends of the boom?

Sealed bearing would IMHO be a retrograde step. Much easier for something to go wrong and much more difficult to fix when it does.
