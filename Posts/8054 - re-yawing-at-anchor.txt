Jim has just posted a story about a wild night in Worbarrow Bay June trip. A wild night in Worbarrow Bay in which he mentions bad yawing at anchor. This is not good news as that is one of the things I was hoping to avoid with my Paradox (we regularly get strong winds in NZ).  Anybody else experienced bad yawing at anchor and solved the problem. Is this a ballast issue perhaps?

I've never experienced significant yawing when anchored from the bow (however stern anchoring can be very 'interesting' in a tideway!).

I would expect the problem to be the turbulent air coming off the cliffs, especially as his neighbour seemed to have similar problems, or possibly competing wind and tide effects.

I have, when F9 was forecast, taken down the mast to quieten things down. This was, however, as much to reduce the buffeting as to prevent yawing. (I doubt that it reached F9 and I was tucked away up an estuary, but I still don't recommend it for a good night's sleep.)
