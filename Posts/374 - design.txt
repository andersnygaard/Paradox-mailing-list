Hi All,

I'm trying to learn a little bit on hull design, Maybe you can help. 
I have been comparing Paradox to Sven's "Bris" Boats, Trying to figure out why his design's are classified as open water boats and Paradox is classified as a Coastal Cruiser. The Only thing I can Come up with is hull shape and a few minor details such as the large windows. For discussion purpose's what would it take to make Paradox a Blue Water Boat? If it can not be done, Why?

Thanks

David Beard
