Hi Al. 

Your candor is always welcome and refreshing. 

Regarding the mainsheet catching between the rudder head and the transom, there is perhaps an easy fix. Fasten a piece of nylon webbing (or line, or even rigging wire) from the rudder head to the deck. It goes without saying, that the webbing should allow for full motion of the rudder. Shock cord would just stretch, thereby allowing the problem of a fouled sheet to continue regardless.

Have you given any thought to leading the mainsheet through the deck, rather than the transom? Seems to me that such could work better. Provided the fairlead (or?) was over the vent baffle, water ingress would not be an issue.
