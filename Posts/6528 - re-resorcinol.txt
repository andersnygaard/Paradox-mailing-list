Al, thanks for the tip. I'll probabably 'attempt' that route.

Your website is fantastic, particulary the Little Jim trip naratives. There wouldn't happen to be a Trip6 out there on the horizon anywhere (wishful thinking)?

Thank you very much for sharing. I'm sure a lot of others appreciate it as well.

Most Respectfully,
