Subject: [SPAM] Re: [SPAM] Paradox windvane steering

Hi Glen,

All this is ingenious. I gave up on a windvane for 'Faith' because I
could not overcome the problems; therefore I'm pleased you have
worked out how to do it. Several of my boats have had windvane servo
systems for easy single-handed sailing. I was relying on what people
had told me about Paradox's canny course-keeping characteristic. I
imagined she would hold her course like Slocum's 'Spray'!!

I'm looking forward to the photos and eventually the drawings. That
will be a great service.

Many thanks,
Bill.

Thanks very much.  I'll really appreciate info on making the gear, since I know how valuable it will be.

Bill.
