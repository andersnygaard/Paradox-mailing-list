Hello Brian,

The point is these nuisance posts like DC's makes real progress difficult, if not impossible. Let me explain.

These time-wasters are just playing mind games. For them, it is not possible to stop this kind of thing, because they enjoy doing just this kind of thing. They belong to these groups to be cute, and for pointless chatter, contributing nothing that is worthwhile to anyone. First, they are cute and then nasty, which is where they want to be in the first place; they are itching for a fight. That's how it is.

You can't leave bad messages stand or let it pass by, meaning it takes a great deal of my time spending non-productive time spent replying to nonsensical messages. Good time wasted. Someone once said if you don't respond to each and every false statement or attack, if left standing it is taken for truth. Can't let that happen.

I have been doing this group thing a long time and know this to be true from past experiences. Members (Good ones) of groups like this join to learn things about their interest, these members are of value, and their posts reflect this.

For those that care, picture me calm when I reply, for that's really how it is. Sometimes you have to first get their attention first, being direct and to the point helps this end this stupid process. I haven't, as yet, found a better way, if anyone has let me know.
