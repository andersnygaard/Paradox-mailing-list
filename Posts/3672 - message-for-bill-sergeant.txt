Subject: Message for Bill Sergeant...

I don't know if Bill is on this site of the other Paradox site. I tried a member search on both but came up zero.

Whatever. smallsailboats seems to have been hijacked by: -

http://www.123-reg.co.uk/

It could just be my computer - anything is possible - but everytime I try and open smallsailboats (one of my favourites) all I get is these ***********s!

Maybe someone could give Bill a message?

(Frustrated as hell!)

Tony.
