I will have the same problem with heat. There used to be an epoxy called COLD-CURE. It was from Canada. I used it long ago and it worked well in the cold.
I will be using poyester resin for the outer skin of fiberglass, as I have five gallons left over from another project. I wish I could find some sort of bladder for water storage to fit where the water tanks are designed to be. Steve Yahn
