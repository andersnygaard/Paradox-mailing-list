Subject: Is Paradox suitable for the "vertically challenged"? ;o)

O.k. I've been intrigued with Paradox for awhile now.... my problem is that I'm 6'4.5" tall and need sitting headroom of 39 inches (not counting a cushion for my aging butt). Sooo, shall I begin looking at other designs? Or could I realistically fit... What are realistic dimensions for a paradox sailer?

Thanks and all the best to you folks,
