Hi All,

I am in the final stages of completion of my pardox, mast is done, boom is done and yard is done, my question is on Matt's new sail plan he talks of luff tape, here goes....

what size luff tape is needed, where can I get some of this, ive been looking and cannot find it. I have not visited the local sail lofts, and I am in R.I. Newport is accross the bay from me. knowing what im looking for would help before I venture out.

Is this really needed?? I would think it helps sail preformance.... can I get along without it for now and add it in the winter when Im not sailing? are there other ways around it?

any input would be greatly appreciated!

Jack
