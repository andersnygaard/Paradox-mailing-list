Subject: Sale of my 'C' Type West Wight Potter

The next best thing to a Paradox is a West Wight Potter. Mine is for sale.

See this link to my blog for full details:

This is a chance to get hold of a boat with some similar characteristics to a Paradox. She's going cheap and she is ready to sail.

Cheers,
Bill.
