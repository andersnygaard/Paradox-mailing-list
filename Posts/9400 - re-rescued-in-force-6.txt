Hi can=E2=80=99t down load your file wish I could
I too have been towed
I didn=E2=80=99t ask but it was offered by sea rescue
Never say no at sea
The rope they used as a towline was too short
When they were going up a wave I was going down , so lots of tugging and jerking occurred , it was ugly
I was on tow for over two hours and the Paradox took all the beating they could supply
I know what you mean about mental state too and yes , keeping your cool is hard , alone , offshore , getting beat up
I even have the area in the cockpit around me padded , after some bruising in a roll over , it came up so violently I got thrown about
Hope your story ended well
