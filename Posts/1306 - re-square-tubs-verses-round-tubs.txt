Hi Nels,

Thank you for your kind words. It is true that the lower the ratio of  resin to hardener the more forgiving the mix. The trade off is in the strength of the end product. There are many times that my projects could have been done with 1:1 mixes but I prefer to just use one epoxy for everything so have stayed with the 5:1 over the years. Also, being the cheapskate that I am, I buy mine from Fiberglass Coatings in St Pete FL in five gal and one gal quantities for considerably less than the west brand. They also give you a full five gal of resin and the same with their hardener. Some people prefer to use acetone (a horribly toxic chemical) or vinegar for cleaning up with. A thinner called T-12 can be purchased from Fiberglass Coatings for about $5 a gal and is far superior to anything else. I am sure you can get the same thing in the West can but they are sooooo proud of their stuff. T-12 has turned out ,for me anyway, to be very cheap because I can put about 2 inches in a coffee can and keep my brushes and tools (putty knife, filleting tools ect.) in it with the lid on and I find myself using the same throw away brush a year later. So what I paid for the thinner I have more then saved on brushes. I tried the vinegar but personally didn't like it.
