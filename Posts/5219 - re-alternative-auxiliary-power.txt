Hi what motor would you put at the top of the leg, a drill motor would 
be too small I guess, and starter motor too big, how about a windscreen 
wiper motor? 
Any other ideas. 
How would one waterproof the motor? 
How about using a flexi drill drive through the bottom / or in a tunnel 
4" pipe would be great with a multi bladed prop. 
Or how about a lifting drive so that the bottom is flush when grounded. 
Extension is going up fast and so boat building will soon continue. 
enigma type, lighter weight, chine runners, lug sail but an open 
cockpit like enigma, does this qualify for this site????!!!!! 
Ikea does some nice stainless brackets (at end of towel rail), that 
boring trip to ikea is not totally a waste of time. 
Yours James.
