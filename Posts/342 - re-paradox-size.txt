Hi Jeff, Jeff here. 

Unfortunately I am not a full time boatbuilder, but I might make my hull drawing available to this group if there was a want, but I would have a problem in what Matt might think, and you would still need to buy a set of PARADOX drawings from Dave and Mindy to complete the boat for the rig etc. As I have said before, I enjoy designing boats for my own use, although I have been commissioned to design for others including workboat manufacturers. I have built to my designs about nine boats so far, including an airboat! 

But Matt's PARADOX ------ I wish I had thought of that. 

Hey Jeff don't you live in the States where as I live in the UK. 

I have in my basement(?) nearly all the wood ready to start building PARAMOUR, which I hope will be April/May'ish depending on my having time, and moving my latest creation out of the way down to my club.
