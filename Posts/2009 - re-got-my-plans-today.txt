Subject: Re: Got my plans today

Hi Alf.

When I was growing up, I couldn't wait to escape Oregon. I moved to Maine and experienced frostbite. Several years later, I discovered heat rash in Mexico. I returned to Oregon. I guess I prefer to mildew. 

Here's a link to the el Toro international yacht racing association. I've never seen anyone aboard an el Toro wearing breton reds, or a blue blazer, so I can forgive them the pompous title. You can find photos, and info on the purchase of plans, etc...

Have fun. Stay warm.
