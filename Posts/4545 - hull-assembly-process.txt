Subject: Hull assembly process

I'm looking for hints and possible pitfalls when it comes to gluing up the hull. I'm making progress with my trial assembly, and the bevels are slowly being sorted out so the cleats lie nice and tight to the side panels. (see http://www.freewebs.com/paradoxbuild/buildingblog.htm)

It has got me thinking about how I'm going to glue all this together. Do you glue it all up in one sitting, or do you do it in stages; perhaps buklheads 3 nad 4, then when set, 1 and transom and finally the stem. However doing this I can't see how you would ensure everything was true and symetrical. I don't have any great desire to have a twisted boat!

To glue it all up together seems like a massive undertaking. Mixing epoxy, clamping frames, drilling pilot holes, squaring everything up, nailing.... it all seems like an awful lot of work and the first joints will have started to set long before the last one is even started!

Am I worrying unnecessarily or will it all fall into place when I start?

Hints and tips from past experience gratefully received.
