Thanks Al & Bryan, I really haven't been keeping track of my time on this as I work on it as the sprit moves me but I would guess about 500 hrs so far spread over a two year period. I decided that this was going to be a fun project and not a job so I've stop to do quite a bit of other things along the way. Right now the sprit is whipping me along, and I am planning an adventure for the fall in it.
