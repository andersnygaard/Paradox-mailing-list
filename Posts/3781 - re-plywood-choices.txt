Seems like laminating the sides, you would just need to seal the sheet edges --
a butt would add hardly any strength, I'd think. After all, your gluing surface 
would already go from about 36 square inches (3/4" x 48") for a butt or about 
384" square for a scarf to over 4600 square inches :)

You may also be able to pre-bend the bottom by adding weights to each end and 
raising the middle.

The next logical progression might be to make your own foam-cored plywood by 
setting up a vacuum bagging system.
