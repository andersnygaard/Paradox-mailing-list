Hi all,

I just got back from the first cruise on my Paradox Odyssey.

Alexander,
Congratulations.
Sounds like you had a great time. The boat looks great. Thanks for posting the photos and videos.
What size engine is that on the back? It looks like a fairly large one with it's external tank.

I'm hoping to launch this coming weekend.

Pete
