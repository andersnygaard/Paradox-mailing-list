Foam could be advantageous for a Paradox build. The foam panels themselves are somewhat lighter than ply but less framing is needed saving more weight and time. Any weight saved gets put into more ballast to bring the boat to her lines. Result should be more stability and better performance.

Current boat is a 34=E2=80=99 tri with decks (cambered) of 1/2=E2=80=9D corecell, 18 oz. biax and 6 oz. cloth both sides, epoxy. No stringers or framing on 6=E2=80=99 x 7=E2=80=99 panel with a hatch cutout in the middle. No fatties have gone through jumping from the wharf.

Decks are easy. Glass inside on a table. Drape over some sort of form frame. Glass side 2. Glue to wood deck clamp or tab to topside panel.

More expensive than ply though, more chemicals, and more mess. Could see foam core deck, maybe topsides, bottom probably best in ply.

I investigated the use of foam with a boat yard. Very interesting stuff and very strong. I had the same concerns over how light foam seemed and they told me that it could be made to any weight I required.

This boat was built in foam..Lots of it.. http://intheboatshed.net/2008/02/29/sven-yrvind-collaborates-with-matt-layden/ 
Chine runners are not a stand alone device like a centerboard or leeboard.  It is basically an extension of the chine... The runner will work as well at any depth....but the chine is part of the boat....and IT needs to be relatively deep with the necessary lifting body hull.  JIB  A boat is a sum of the parts...that is the genius of Matt's designs.

The design of the paradox in plywood is part of the need to get great weight into the finished design. The chine runners need to be well submerged to do their work. If the boat were built of light weight foam the overall "gestalt" of the design is upset. Also you would become a designer yourself and not be tied to this "exact" design. I may be awkward for anyone to give handy advice too.
