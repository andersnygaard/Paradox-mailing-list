Subject: Newbie presentation, and some questions

Hi all,

I am a lurker on this list and I have followed the list with great interrest. My name is Karl and I live in Gothenburg, Sweden.

I used to live quite close to where Sven Yrvind ( then Sven Lundin ) build his first Bris. And like any normal kid, I was intrigued by the fact that it was possible to build your own boat and sail it around the world.

Fast forward som thirty years, the dream still lives on. And via Sven's web page I found the Paradox. It seems to be made just for me...

So, here comes the question: how much time have You that have completed Your built spent on the project?

Kind regards,
Karl
