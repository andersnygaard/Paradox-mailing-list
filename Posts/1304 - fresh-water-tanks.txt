Subject: Fresh Water tanks

Has anybody used the freshwater tanks as sea water ballast tanks? Allow them to flood as you launch and drain/pump out on recovery? Is it feasible? Any thoughts or opinions?
70 litres of fresh water for a European solo sailor seems a little excessive and Alistair? has said that it can be difficult to find a convenient hosepipe.
I am planning to use a couple of those 10 litre bladders that have a tap and a hanging handle.
