Wise idea I made from Oregon in one piece and had them pre bent a little by bending  them in the sun . They were very hard to fit and needed two men a lot of banging and lots of clamps.

Here they are bent under load on my house porch beams.

Several jobs on a paradox benefit from laminations if thinner timber , I went the hard way
The 19 mm or 3/4" ply on the hull bottom was difficult , I had stiff first grade marine boat building ply and used over half a tonne of weights to get it to bend into shape while drying.
It all adds up to one hell of a hull, I'm never afraid of the hull in any weather. It can take a monster amount of punishment load wise.
