Subject: Re: Fill/suction copper pipes

Bill,

Take a look at my plumbing photos in the files section for the way I did it. I'm very pleased with the outcome and connect a hose to the sink pump when back on the trailer and lead it out the vent hole. A couple of pumps and the tanks drain by siphon action. The only change I would make would be to use cvpvc instead of pvc as it is smaller. I have sailed with and without water in the tanks and while it is a little more tender, it is not a problem. I now only fill the tanks when I will be out for more than a day or two. I used a five part epoxy similar to WEST and have had no problem other than this twitch in my left eye (just kidding). Scrub out the tank real good to remove any amine blush before using it for drinking water. By the way, Matt uses a fuel bulb to get water out of his tanks. He says it goes a long way to encourage fresh water conservation.

I've spent quite a while examining your photos. Many thanks for them; also the tip about cvpvc.

Bill.
