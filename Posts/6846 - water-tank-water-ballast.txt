How many builders are using the tanks for drinking water? Some builders have mentioned that their tanks leak a little bit (some anyway). In Annie Hill's book "Voyaging on a small income" she says that on their boat they have no holding tanks but use one gallon jugs for their water. So perhaps building the water tanks as two more holds for "general stores" they could hold water (say in 2 liter bottles) or tins of food or lead ballast as needed. Having more options usually is a good idea. I sure would like to hear from others.

Cheers,
