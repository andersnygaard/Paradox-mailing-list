I'm not sure what you mean by "considering that you have copied so much from Paradox" Al. Do you mean the reefing system or the whole boat?
I understand what was meant now with "missing an axis".
It's not a big deal to modify the lower part to the original idea of a piece of string to make the universal joint.
The castor joint is steel and should be plenty strong to take the tensile load.
