Hi,

Is this Paradox included in Paradox registry? If it is still considered a Paradox.

It is from this page http://ftp.ij.net/wctss/wctss/photos107.html, to be scrolled down. It is said to be Tom's Paradox. Would be interesting to know how she behaves with the Marconi rig. Although chine runners also seem to be missing.

Regards,
Eerik
