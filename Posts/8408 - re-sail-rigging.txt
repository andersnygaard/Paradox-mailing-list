William, if your boom is warped, I would start over again using very dry wood.  I build canoe paddles and once one is warped, there is not much you can do to straighten it without it always wanting to return to its warped shape.  The wood seems to "remember" its natural shape.  That's why you need to use dry wood, where its natural shape has already been determined.
