Subject: Foredeck Hatch?
Date: 19 Nov 2016 07:49:01 -0800

In one of Don Elliot's sketches that show up on the internet, there was what might have been a hatch forward of the mast. Although I have not seen any Paradoxes built with such a hatch, it seems that it might be a good idea for loading heavy stores such as a deep cycle battery, water jugs, etc. into that forward compartment. Any thoughts?
