And to the level of ones physical ability and skills and types of weather conditions. And that would apply to everyone. You have to decide for yourself.

Sailing is not that popular in this area since in summer the winds are so very light it is frustrating. But the house boaters love it!

I really enjoy reading anything you write. Perhaps some day you can come here and get a taste of the place yourself - literally. The river outside my door experiences one of the largest Pacific salmon migrations anywhere. It peaks every four years and in 2006 I think was estimated at 3-4 million that spawned in the Adams River further upstream. Nothing compared to the past when it was millions more. An awesome expression of nature and something to behold nonetheless.

This link tells about the sockeye and there are 3 other species migrating during the same period in Sept-Oct each year.
