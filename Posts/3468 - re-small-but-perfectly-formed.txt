Hi everyone,

I had a look at Alistair's boat today. We both squatted in the little cabin, sheltering from the rain and discussing the wee beastie.

The thing that was most noticeable on first impression is how solid the construction is. It all feels very sturdy and would make a good icebreaker (perhaps not... I doubt it would be heavy enough  ;-)).

The cabin is as small as I anticipated and the access to the fore part difficult even for a legless drawf. But all so light and airy that there is no feeling of claustrophobia.

I think that if it was me building it, I would arrange the hatch to elevate a little, so that there would be good sitting headroom while at anchor. Should be do-able and would make the ship more comfortable for sitting and relaxing when it was raining too much to have the hatch slid open.

Alistair has made a lovely job of building his. Very brave too, as his is the first one in UK, so when he started his he had never seen one in the flesh and could not have been sure it would really suit him. That's a big decision to make with only pictures and internet articles available to him. But it's all turned out brilliantly and he's rightly dead proud of his boat.

Thanks for letting me have a look Al.

Best regards,

Jim Hall
