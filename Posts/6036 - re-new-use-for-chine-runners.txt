Sounds like you had a great time Steve.

I remember the first time I experienced luminesense (1979 I think).
We were delivering a Ron Holland 40 footer back to her home port in Ireland after racing in Cowes week. There were 4 of us onboard and we left The IOW at 2200 to catch the tide down the Solent. We were working 4 hour watches and I was first down. Needless to say I didn't sleep much and so when I was shaken at 0200 I was dog tired. My watch mate decided that he was going suffer from sea sickness and spent most of the time sprawled in his bunk. Just before dawn I had a tremendous shock. I thought that we were being chased by hundreds of sea creatures. I called my mate who came on deck to see waht I was shouting about. The water was glowing with thousands of sparkling green snakes of green phosphorescent light. At one point we were enveloped in a green sea of light - really remarkable. I'll never forget the experience and have never seen such a vivid display since.

Now must get this Paradox finished...
