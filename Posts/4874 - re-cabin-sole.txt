If Paradox gets beached stern first, the corners either side of the transom are vulnerable to wear, although adequately strong to withstand quite a battering.  Stern first on a pebbly beach is not advised because the base of the rudder can get thumped.  I learnt this lesson last year and I'll take care not to allow it to happen again.

The reason why I went in stern first was to get a good night's sleep by trying to incline the sole of my boat so that my head would be higher than my feet.  Going in bow first on a fairly steep beach means that if you want your head higher than you feet you have to sleep with your head nearest the bow.  That I don't like doing because the base of the vent box gets in the way of my head.  Therefore it makes sense to find a gently shelving beach, and if circumstances allow get the boat as horizontal as possible.


I've done that too, Bill.

One thing that interested me about the design of the Paradox rudder is the fact that a upward force on the rudder, as when beaching, pushes the rudder up till it hits the underside of the boat and doesn't apply large loads to the pintles (although the lower pintle is 15mm anyway). So bouncing on a beach as you dry out or refloat, although it sounds bad and can be uncomfortable, doesn't do any harm to the structure.
