Which paraxox would that be? Well if it isn't the other one it must be mine, 'Small Fry'. She is well built, pretty much as per design except for a slightly modified hatch which is hinged rather than sliding. She has a fairly extensive cruising history up and down the WA coast and has been everywhere on her own keel from Shark Bay to Cape Leeuwin.

If there is any interest I will post more pictures and details.

Small Fry, Fremantle.
