I like the Paradox too, sail mostly alone and my fit my needs. But have been eyeing the following which will accomidate 2 people. Look at the Norwalk Island Sharpie 18. Real nice boat, will cost more to build of course. Also the B&amp;B Core Sound 19 and AD16/Adelie 16.

If anyone see's a Peep Hen for sale let me know.

Regards Niels.
