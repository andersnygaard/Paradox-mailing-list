Subject: Re: NEW SAIL

After getting the balance sorted I lengthened my gap to about 12 inches so that the sail material was not trapped between the yard and mast. As long as the sail is tensioned along the Yard it could be much longer without significant effect on the performance. I also added a wear patch to the lower sleeve where the boom presses it against the mast.

Half round?? My sleeve just stops and then starts again further on.

Hoping for calm nights

Yes of course - forgot about tension on the sail. And the wear patch is another good idea.

Thanks again,
