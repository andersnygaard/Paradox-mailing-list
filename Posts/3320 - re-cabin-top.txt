Yea, there have been times when harrowing events have happened; I recollect one especially bad time when I capsized a racing kayak, while participating in a race across the Bristol Channel from Barry in Wales to the seaside resort of Weston-super-Mare, on the north coast of Somerset, but I suppose there never will be time to tell of all the good sailing I've enjoyed, leave alone recording those frightening and life-threatening moments I've experienced at sea.

Regarding a book about my nautical exploits; well, I guess my web site is the nearest I'll ever get to it, although I did write a crazy, lighthearted, science fiction novel about a selfish, money-grabbing, power-seeking monk who worshipped his mobile phone instead of God - until he was enlightened; then in the service of his Master he came to the point of martyrdom through execution on the gallows for his testimony, but did the hooded executioner carry out the dastardly deed?  There the novel ends with speculation =96 was he asphyxiated by the noose, and if so, did he enter the realms of a spiritual world?

Bill.
