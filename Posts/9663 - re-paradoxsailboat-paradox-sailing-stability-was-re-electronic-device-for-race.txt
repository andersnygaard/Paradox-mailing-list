Subject: Re: [paradoxsailboat] Paradox sailing stability (was Re: Electronic device for race)

I would like to add (far less eloquently) that I completely agree with Alastair and Andre.  I own a Paradox and a Enigma460.  My Dox is stock in every way, and I don’t know the sail version.

I’ve also owned more than a dozen sailboats and have sailed many many hundreds of miles but consider myself a mediocre sailor at best.

All that said, the Dox is the best sailing monohull I have ever owned.   I continue to be amazed every time I sail her.  My tiller line rarely gets touched once on course.  I’ve not timed it but yes, I can imaging going hours without input.  Further, I’ve never had a boat that sailed like she was on a rail like the Dox.   I love the feeling of just sitting inside, comfortably resting while she sails on a steel rail pulling powerfully and continuously without me having to worry a bit.
