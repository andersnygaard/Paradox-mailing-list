Subject: Re: Furling Friction

Hello Paradoxians,

I wanted to update this post because as a new owner of a Paradox, I too went through the experiences that most expressed when furling the sail. At first very difficult to get the torque to pull the line to roll the sail. The solution was offered by Andre Francois in a previous post; add a topping lift to the forward end of the boom. By connecting a line - to the spindle rod in front of the drum and leading the line up to a pulley on the starboard side of the mast down to the cabin - one is able to pull on the line to cause the drum to align with the tubing that fixes the boom forward.

Reducing the angle that the furling line needs to travel from drum to inside the cabin made the biggest improvement. Many thanks for sharing and supporting others who are sailing paradox boats.

Fair winds,
Deric
