Do any of you have the full email archive (or even a large portion of it)?

There are about 9,500 messages going back to 2001.

When I first joined, I was keeping a copy, but then I rationalized my email collection a bit a figured I could always look these up on Yahoo. Hmmm... I guess not any more.

I'd like to archive the contents of this group now if I can, but spidering/mirroring Yahoo is going to be tricky. If anyone has an archive of the emails they can share with me I'd be very appreciative.

I don't know who the group moderator is now. Does the moderator have access to create an archive of the conversations?

Thanks,

Matt

PS. I don't do Facebook, so thank you all for your contributions here over the years. If I do eventually build and launch a Paradox I promise I'll sign up to Facebook temporarily so I can let you know. :-)
