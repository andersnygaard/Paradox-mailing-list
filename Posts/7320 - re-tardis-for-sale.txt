Subject: Re: TARDIS for sale

Too bad it isn't closer, like in Australia! ;-)

I've been sadly observing this  mini-spate of Paradoxes for sale wishing someone in AU would sell one.

I briefly researched the cost of shipping one here from the USA in a container and it was going to be $3-4k.

I think there are probably only two in Australia to start with. 
Never mind. I'll just have to build it. :-D
