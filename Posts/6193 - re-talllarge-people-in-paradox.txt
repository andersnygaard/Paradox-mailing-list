You might consider looking at the article for slightly enlarging Paradox which is in the group files section

Larger Paradox

Some comments and numbers for a 20% larger (16.5 ft.) Paradox

I am 6'3"/220 lbs.

I am wondering if I will comfortably fit in the Paradox without substantial alterations.

Are there tall/large users in the group?

Please, share your experience?

Thanks,

Alexander
