Hi Paul.

This eventually becomes another rolling bevel. In this case, and in the case of the sheer clamps, the parts are cut with the constant bevel as shown in the plans. After the chine logs are one with the sides and bulkheads, the chine logs are dressed off with the aid of a straight edge, to accept the flat bottom. The extra 'triangular portion' to which you refer, is eventually removed where necessary. Similarly, the sheer clamps are faired to the deckbeams, to accept the deck.

Referring to your drawing, note that the corner through which your red line passes, remains untouched through the length of the chine log. This corner is the lower, outboard corner, and is always aligned with the edge of the side panel. Now picture the sheer clamp. In it's case, the upper outboard corner remains untouched, and likewise, is always aligned with the edge of the side panel.

It may help you visualize the relationships of these parts, by sawing out a short length of sheer clamp and chine log. These are necessary at any rate, to help you determine where you need to cut the bulkheads, transom, and stem.
