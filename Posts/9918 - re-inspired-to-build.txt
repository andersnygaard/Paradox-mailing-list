Subject: Re-inspired to build

I ordered Paradox plans @7 years ago if I remember correctly and can't for the life of me find the PDF files. Maybe I deleted them.

I just emailed Dave B for a new set. Is that the current best way to get plans? I also ordered Dons Book.

I've had many of the popular trailer sailors (Precision, Potter, ComPacs) over the past 10 years sailing them on Lake Erie and inland lakes. I now have a new to me a very nice 2005 Montgomery 17 sitting in the front yard! I've done basic repairs on my boats but never built one.

I started thinking about building something again and was really considering a Tiki 21 or 26 but TWO hulls, essentially building two boats seems overwhelming for a first build. I keep being drawn to the Paradox and have decided to start building one ASAP.

I am trying to determine the estimated Plywood sheets required and Epoxy. If anyone can share these details it would be much appreciated!
