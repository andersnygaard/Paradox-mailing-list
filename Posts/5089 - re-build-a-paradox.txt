Subject: Re: BUILD A PARADOX

Hello Alan 

Despite the fact that we have a broad and beautiful river and a sea open to any possibility, which is practiced only is the rowing. Nobody sails sailing in the area, is not widespread, only a few make windsurf.En any opportunities we see ships tied few days to continue their journey further south. To know the area I recommend look at Google eahrt (43 =BA 21'00 "S, 65 =B0 03'00" W), and we can see how much coastline to go. 

Is it makes me happy as much data as possible to deal with the construction of the Paradox. Thank you
