By this do you mean a stationary fairlead through which the rope rubs?

I have a Tufnol sheave running on a stainless pin. If I were modifying this I would be tempted to fit a proper bearing. The operation that requires the greatest physical exertion on board is hauling up the sail, and anything that makes it easier has to be a good thing.
