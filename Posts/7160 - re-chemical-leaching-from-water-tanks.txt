Subject: Re: Chemical Leaching From Water Tanks


After I first answered you, The answer nagged me a little, so i went searching. I found that tank cleaning companies still use steam cleaning, with the caveat that the tank surface not get too tot in the process. 180=C2=B0F seems to be the limit.

Also, West system has a web page on things to consider if you make your own tanks using their epoxies. It looks like one of the tips is to use a resin rich, hardener lean mix, and to mix especially well. They then tell you how to clean them and add you might want to add a filter, I assume charcoal.
They provide some suggested mixes.
