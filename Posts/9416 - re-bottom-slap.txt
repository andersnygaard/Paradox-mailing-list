Subject: Re: Bottom Slap

This is one of the great things about a Paradox. It doesn't slap, not for me anyway. My previous sharpie used to pound like crazy, but it was much more lightly constructed, bow above water, incorporated an anchor well and had no foam insulation. My Paradox has quite a bluff bow and all Paradox's have a massive stem and a submerged bow. I suspect the chine runners also help to mitigate noise when waves hit the side of the boat.
