Where I sail, any decent wind produces steep, close together sets of waves. Having sailed prams, dinghys and various other boats I refuse to sail a pram in waves. Nothing worse that trying to claw off the beach in a pram in waves. I understand a paradox has lots of momentum and mass behind it, unlike a mirror dinghy, I am just wanting to take care in building to suit and comfort. Watching the videos of scout, it does plow while running under decent winds. This paradox will be sailed in many conditions, most having 2' waves.  Nick, does your paradox lose momentum in waves when it pierces them?
