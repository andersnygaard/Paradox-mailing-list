Subject: Re: Little Jim, a non-standard Paradox

My past boating experiances have been either on a motorboat or a rowboat. Spent many hours rowing when I was growing up. What impressed me about watching a yuloh at work was the ease in which the work was performed. The vertical oar may make the boat go faster but I wonder if the work is harder. It looks like a person could scull for hours, this could be an illusion as I have never used a yuloh. 

No illusion, low energy input, and you have a hand free to hold a can of something.
