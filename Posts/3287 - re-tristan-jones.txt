I've always enjoyed Tristan (not his real name) Jone's books excepting the novels. Then I read Anthony Dalton's book and discovered that they were all novels!
He was apparently a fraud, a thief and a plagiarist who didn't wash too often, but wasn't ICE a cracking tale?

Actually anyone interested in Tristan Jones should read "Wayward Sailor in Search of the real Tristan Jones" by Anthony Dalton. It is an incredibly well researched biography of Tristan's life and a wonderful read in it's self. It puts to rest just how much BS Tristan spewed, ICE was complete BS as an example, while giving credit to the fact that he was a master story teller.
I have always loved reading his works and getting caught up in the stories but for the most part, they're just that. A better teller of sea stories is hard to find. He was pretty much a master mariner and a lot of good info on seamanship is to be had between the covers of his books.

Tristan Jones is above all a grand storyteller. I think it is best to enjoy the story without subjecting him to a lie detector. After all, there are usually a few lies in most of our stories. Most critics consider him to be a great adventurer and an artful master of tall tales. How much is true...well he took that information to the grave with him, no dought.
