I think many things could happen that could make a site go offline and to prevent loss of data, we could make backups in pdf format and store in the file section on yahoo. 

Using openoffice, a free text editor http://www.openoffice.org/, it is simple to do it. Only create a new document and click File then Export as PDF. 

Is this a good thing? Do the blog authors want to create themselves or do they give the ability to volunteers to make it? 

I uploaded an example from Lezlie blog in this folder:

Like it? :)

Thank you,
Fernando
