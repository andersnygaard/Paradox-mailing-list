First - that you were able to drop the mast in those kinds of
conditions. Then it still kept moving, which perhaps confirms that the
hull itself works as a "lifting body" which is what Sven Yrvind has
claimed with this type of hull. Combined with the momentum from a
relatively heavy displacement.

I was going from Calshot (put it into Google Earth) east to Langstone 
Harbour (the second inlet) and under the bridge at the top of Hayling 
Island into Chichester Harbour. The wind was pretty well due west. It 
was near low water when I reached the bridge so there was a lot more 
mud and a lot less water, meaning it was fairly calm. I was able to 
nip onto the deck and drop the mast on top of the sail and then run 
through almost directly down wind.

Hoping for calm nights
