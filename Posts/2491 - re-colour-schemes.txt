Subject: Re: Colour Schemes

I was just fooling around in Photoshop today, and I came up with these colors for the hull. You can look at the chart I made in the Files section under "Hull Color." At the moment I kind of like color "H" which is kind of a light olive color. This might go nicely with the red sail.
