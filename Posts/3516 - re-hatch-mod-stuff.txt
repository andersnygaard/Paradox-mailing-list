Subject: Re: Hatch mod stuff

Would the 'hinges' actually be some type of strong fabric
rather than metal ones? How else do you prevent it leaking?
The sliding hatches of whatever design do have the advantage of
being capable of being slammed shut in a big hurry if required,
such as when you are at 60deg heel and still going over! -not
that this would EVER happen of course....
