Buy a metric steel tape and work in millimetres. It really is much easier.

I cut the chine log and sheer clamp to the profiles on sheet 5. After the sides are on the bulkheads spring them into position. When the bottom and deck go on they will need some trimming to get them just right.

I took the bulkhead bevel angles off sheet 2, but needed to make lots of adjustment (including adding material) during assembly. Now I would recommend making the bulkhead cleats oversize and cutting the angle during the trial assembly.
