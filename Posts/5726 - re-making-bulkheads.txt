Can anyone tell me if the 5 and 7mm extra piece on the edges of bulkheads 1,2 and 3 are completely necssary. The plans show a straight line then 5 or 7mm curve added. Has anyone built without this?

Yep,... I need help with this also as I just paid attention to what he is saying and went over the plans.... um... thank goodnes I only have bulkhead 1 epoxied...  Is it possible to just make the side cleats extend over the plywood blkhead sides the required amount and shave down to shape curve? I would hate to have to re-cut the plywood bulkheads, as it were it looks like I will be re-doing blkhead #1.

Thanks,
Rod
