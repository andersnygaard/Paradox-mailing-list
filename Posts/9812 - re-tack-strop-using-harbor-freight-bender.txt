I purchased Steve Yahn's Paradox 8 years ago just before he passed away. Nice guy. For your information, the modifications he made to the furling device failed under pressure in a strong wind. He had used 3/8 inch SS rod and it folded, touching the drum, which prevented furling. I was going downwind at the time in puffs of up to 30 knots, couldn't furl. I remember that incident as the run of my life, found out how fast the Paradox can go. Two hours of stress with the boom hitting the water alternatively on both sides of the boat before I made it out of the Saguenay Fjord's cliffs.

After that, I rebuilt the furling device with 1/2 inch rod exactly as per plan, with the rope pivot. It just works better because it has 360-degree motion.

Also, I no longer use a full topping lift. I got the sail mixed up in it too many times, following Matt Layden's advice. However, I find that a single line half-topping lift attached to the furling rod in front of the roller really helps support some of the weight and makes furling easy enough. I don't use my foot to furl, not necessary, but I did change the cleat angle so the ropes run straight back instead of downwards. Note that you can still furl with both hands by slacking the halyard about 8 inches at a time and cleating it, then pulling on the furling line to pick up the slack.

Best wishes, 

André-François
