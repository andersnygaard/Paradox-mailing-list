Hi Bill,

   The Mk2 Sail's has a higher aspect ratio, as Matt states in the sail.doc.  You get the same shape and ratio when reefed in. Its  a pain when you want to get that sail away and get back inside, or not wanting to go outside at all. otherwise its not really a problem. he also says its more weatherly, because the top is peaked more.
