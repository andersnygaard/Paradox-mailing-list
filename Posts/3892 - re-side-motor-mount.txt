Subject: Re: Side Motor Mount

I've seen pics of this scheme in more than one book, can't remember where exactly, but in both cases the boats were double-enders, so couldn't have the motor 'at the back'.
So it obviously must work ok. Also people sometimes move larger cruisers by lashing the dinghy+outboard alongside...
As Al says, you'd have to be VERY sure the prop doesn't get a chance to eat your chine-runners, chines, sides...
