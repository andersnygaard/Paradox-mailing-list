My past boating experiances have been either on a motorboat or a rowboat. Spent many hours rowing when I was growing up. What impressed me about watching a yuloh at work was the ease in which the work was performed. The vertical oar may make the boat go faster but I wonder if the work is harder. It looks like a person could scull for hours, this could be an illusion as I have never used a yuloh.

I just read in a different forum where some guy made a couple of yuloh's and said his boat was faster when he just used a straight vertical oar instead of the yuloh!!! Robb
