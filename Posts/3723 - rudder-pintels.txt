Subject: Rudder Pintels

When the rudder blade is raised up vertical would it not scrape against the upper Pintel brackets? How did you guys manage this? I have wondered about epoxying in a pin for both the upper and lower positions of the rudder stock, to eliminate this conflict. It's less costly too.
