Subject: Re: Any Paradox's on the West Coast

Hiya Michael,

Yes, well kinda. There is a gentleman, Mark Waters, who built a wonderful boat on this coast but I don't know if the boat is still here. I have been building one here in Venice, California for the last 2 and a half yrs or so. The build has been very very slow due to lotsa "Life" intrusion. I am almost finished but have taken a siesta from the build til spring as I have just completed a Yostwerks SeaBee 13 kayak and will be taking it out all winter here. If you have questions or would like to see the build you can email me off forum at rdnycannon @ yahoo.com (no spaces). Put Paradox in the subject as I will save it from the spam box.
