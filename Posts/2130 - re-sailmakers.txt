I bought 5.5 oz dacron off season and got a great deal, bought some V69 thread and needles from sailright, 1/4 " seamstick tape and went out on a flat area of the lawn and staked out the sail, cut the pieces, and layed out the broadseams, not a hard task at all, and very light work compared to boat building, then I got 2 sections of vynl gutter, ea 10 ft long, set up a long table with sawhorses and rolled the sail on a piece of 2" pvc pipe, and temp masking taped it on the pipe, then i set the gutter up to align with the presser foot and down the seams I go! "the pvc pipe is stationary and the sail slides thru it" Its my first crack at sail making and it is not difficult, in fact its a needed skill for the cruiser, to be able to fix the motor yourself !!!!!!!  I have yet to sew the pockets as I have to build the yard and boom first. in a related story I was caught with moms zig zag machine and got a stern warning........ since I have been blessed with a donated sailright LS1 ultrafeed machine, and altho it will not do zigzags, its all I will ever need, you can just double up the # of stitches. at this point I have less than 150.00$ US into the sail. altho its not a professionaly cut sail, I have a sail I built, and I know how to fix it.
