Stephen,

I added one to the photos album too but then I moved it up to the front page near the Iron sides frames photos so as to make a whole idea comprehensive. Thanks anyway for the effort. The sail has trouble and needs to be fixed. The sleeves Sailrite designed are too big. The head sleeve especially.

OK- your idea is better - I deleted the one I had added.

Sorry to hear about the sail challenges!
