Really I'm sorry, accompany the pain of losing so hopeless. Never forget the care and aid received from Don to be able to build my boat.

Just in case anyone has missed the sad news posted on 
paradoxboatbuilders forum, I've posted the message below.

Attention all Paradox boat builders members:

After a lengthy battle with cancer Don passed away on December 2,
2008. I'm Wanda his wife and he wanted me to continue to make his
instructional materials available to the public for purchase.
Unfortunately, I have limited knowledge of boat building so I will be
unable to answer any related questions. Procedures for ordering
materials will continue as normal, although initially there may be
some delays. 
Don really enjoyed this group and was passionate about it. He
regretted that he was unable to continue his work. My son and his wife
and I plan on keeping his boat (Paradox) and hope to sail it with the
grandchildren. We like to believe that Don has sailed off into a new
adventure.
Please withhold any orders until after Jan.1 2009

Sincerely, 
Wanda Elliott
