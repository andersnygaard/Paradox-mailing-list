I believe the upper angle is what provides lateral resistance when heeled over and dug in. I seem to remember people on this list saying it was important to have the chine runner deep in the water to be effective. Kind of like in my hard chine kayaks, to turn left, I lean right to dig in the right curved chine of the kayak. Since it curves to the left, I go left. I'm imagine the chine runners work exactly this way, to allow the curve of the chined edge to actually alter the course of the boat. Phil Bolger puts a bottom plate on some of his rudders which allows water to stick to the bottom edge without spilling off, making it more effective. Since the whole side of the Paradox is curved, the hard chine makes the water stick to the bottom edge without flowing over and spilling onto the bottom surface which makes the side effective for steering control. When going staight and getting hit with cross waves, the chine is not dug in so the boat rides up and goes over the wave. My kayaks are pvc skin on aluminum tube, so my chines are in effect rounded. So the skin at the top of the chine tube depresses in allowing it to catch the water, where on Paradox you have the flat surface. The rounded bottom edge on both allows the water to flow under when not dug in.

I'm guessing that if in a Paradox where you are in a condition that could trip it, you would want to sail it more upright so as to present the curved radius on the bottom so water will slide underneath, and not catch the upper edge as much.

Well this is how I picture it!
