Hi All,

If you plan to install a Hasp on the hatch to lock your Paradox, always install the hinged part on the aft window, NEVER on the hatch itself ! If everthing is lined up right, and you close the hatch from the inside, you could lock yourself inside ! Not that I have done this, but in 90 deg weather it will get really hot in there untill sombody lets you out. Just a thought........ It did happen.
