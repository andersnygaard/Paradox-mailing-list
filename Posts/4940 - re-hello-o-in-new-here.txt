Hi Al and Bill,
I'll take that as a 'no' then...
(There would still be a forward thrust 'vector').
Just thinking-out-loud really.As always,'improvements'
are hardly ever that.
What about just the rear-deck entry, leaving the sheet
on the clew-end of the boom? Not enough difference to clear
an outboard? Introduce some other problems?
Cheers,
Alan.
