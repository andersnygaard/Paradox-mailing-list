Subject: Re: Epoxy & Fibreglass

I would just try to keep things simple for this project. Cover the topsides with 4 oz glass, and then put several layers of 10 oz glass or some woven roving on the bottom. I wouldn't bother going any lighter than the 4 oz above the waterline. It probably won't hold up that well, and it's too easy to sand through. The Kevlar might not be the best choice for your project since it is a little tricky to use and rather expensive. Kevlar is generally buried under fiberglass in this application because it can't be sanded directly.

I was hoping you would elaborate Dave since I was thinking along the same lines. In fact if the boat is going to be used on local rivers and lakes and mostly on a trailer, one layer of 10 oz on the bottom may be enough. Two layers at most. I say this because of the cost of the epoxy to completely fill the weave.

Glad you mentioned that kevlar should be under the glass and not on top. However I can see no real need for kevlar at all. It's major advantage is in it's strength to weight ration and on the bottom of a ballasted boat weight saving is not a priority. There are other glasses that is very abrasive resistant. Referred to as e-glass and some other name I can't recall. I think Sven uses it.

Most of my knowledge is based on canoe building. Using this kind of glass and mixing carbon into the epoxy, makes an extremely abrasive resistant finish.
