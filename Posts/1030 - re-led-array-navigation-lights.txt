Interesting posts. Up here, we have kinder gentler, well ok, all but 
abscent coasties, so we can pretty much do what we want. With the 
increasing availability of sensible arrangements as mentioned, the 
need to do something stupid sorta declines. However, there are some 
pretty cool garde "moonlights" that integrate led, battery and, solar 
panel for about 10 bucks. They even look like a masthead light. I'm 
guessing they may not be bright enough.
