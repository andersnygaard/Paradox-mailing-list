Cheers George.

Unfortunately I don't have the software to open your file up.

Bearing in mind the different shapes of boats I don't think you can compare a PARADOX with a boat of the same length.

I use to own a Leisure 17 but that only weighed about 1400lbs and had a beam of 7 feet. That's over 400lbs less than my latest design and the same weight as PARADOX.

Frightening eh?
