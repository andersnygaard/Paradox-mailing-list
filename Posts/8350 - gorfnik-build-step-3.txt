I figured it would be easier to paint the insides of the flotation chambers BEFORE assembly. But I didn't paint the areas which would later be glued together. The reason I painted the non-visible inside chambers is to prevent eventual condensation from rotting out the plywood from the inside.

Also, I added some plywood dividers so that gear put into the inspection hatches could not roll out of arms-length-reach. I left a 1 inch space at the bottom of the dividers so if ever water gets into the flotation chambers (heaven forbid), it will flow to where it can be sponged through the inspection hatches.

Note that after a full summer in the water, there has not been a single drop in there.
