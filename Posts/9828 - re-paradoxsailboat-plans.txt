Hello Roger! 

Yes, they are still available. David Bolduc is selling the plans on behalf of Matt Layden. Wanda Elliott is selling the build manual on behalf of her late husband, Don Elliott.

I am attaching a copy of a cover letter written by David Bolduc which contains all of the necessary contact information.

You will have to be patient in getting a response from either David or Wanda in as much as they are pretty busy and sometimes don't respond right away.

Best regards,
Robert Ford
