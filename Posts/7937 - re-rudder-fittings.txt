There is also a process called "lost wax casting". Sealing wax or beeswax is used as the male mold, the female mold is cast around it, and the wax is then melted and allowed to run out of it. Another alternative is sand casting. Both of these techniques have been used for hundreds of years.

Since it's been almost that long since I studied these techniques, you'll have to dig for further details. The details I remember are pretty sketchy.
