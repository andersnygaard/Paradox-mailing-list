The difference is in the degree of rocker between Bolgers designs and the Paradox. My 26ft modified Glen-L design has only about 4 inches of rocker at the center of buoyancy... it is almost flat like a Paradox, while Bolgers designs have nearly 24 inches. That would make the chine runner a half moon shape.. not great for a keel line at all. This is why many of Bolgers designs used Leeboards.. the down side being the board in the water. The Advanced Sharpie designs incorporate centerboards and my Glen-L has a swing-keel, though it tracks well with the keel up.

Andrew,
I don't disagree, the Bolger boats handle fine as they are but somebody might want enhanced shallow water performance and a possible way of providing that would be to experiment with Chine Runners. If the boats were build as designed and the Chine Runners were glued on (some experimentation with positioning and size required) then the boats could possibly be made to sail with their boards up in shallow water. I would consider this a truly noble experiment. Here is a sketch I found comparing Jessie Cooper with Paradox and Little Cruiser.
These boats are similar in design and the Chine Runners could be glued on for testing then ground back off if they didn't work. They would not have to effect the operation of the boards on any of the designs. If they were found add to much drag during normal operation then remove them and how much is lost. Just a little time, labor, and material.
Sincerely,Gene T.

I know its the Jessie Cooper and that it is 1 generation earlier. The Bolger AS-19 AS-29 and AS-39 all have the same hull shape. I chose that picture because it shows it beached out of the water.
The (A)dvanced (S)harpie series of boats can be found here.

A distant view of the AS-29
Also look for BOLGER SQUARE BOATS. Chine runners would not help and would only hinder those designs which have no trouble tracking to begin with.

Andrew,
Close but one generation earlier. I think that is a Jessie Cooper on the cover of Boats with an Open Mind. Similar in shape to the AS-29 I think. Also your description isn't that far from a description of paradox. Heavy ballasted boat, pronounced rocker, same for the chine shape. That is why the chine has a significant fillet on its top side. The bottom is curved. Who knows, chine runners might work. It wouldn't take that much to add them although the slots for the bilge boards could cause complications.

Has anyone built a bolger 29 with chine runners ? Would it be feaseable . What would be the pros and cons . I am presently just dreaming of building one . I would like to combine the bolger and paradox with a ketch junk rig.
Cheers
