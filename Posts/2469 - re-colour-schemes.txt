Another issue with which to contend is that epoxy, when heated 
strongly by the sun, can become softer if it gets in the neighborhood 
of 150+ degrees F. Darker colors enhance this effect and should 
probably not be used except closer to the waterline.

I don't think there will be much trouble keeping the boat out of 
those conditions as they only happen here at night (and when the moon 
is blue).Hoping for calm nights
