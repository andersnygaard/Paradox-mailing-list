I've sailed on the Hudson near Catskill. It is possible, though slow going, to make headway against the current if the wind fails, but you're better off sailing. The Erie Canal is a VERY long way to try to scull, but the mast on a Paradox is short enough to leave it standing. You'll be going into the wind most of the time heading west from Albany, though. 
If I were doing it, I'd be inclined to take the Oswego Canal into Lake Ontario and get to Lake Erie via the Welland. Or take the Champlain Canal and fight the current in the St. Lawrence; the Thousand Islands would be a wonderful cruising ground for a Paradox.
