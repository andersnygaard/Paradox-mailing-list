Subject: Re: Appox build time, plans, cost??

I just ordered the plans from Dave Bolduc (http://www.microcruising.com/)

They are not actually listed for sale on his site but if you E-mail him,
he will send you the ordering information.

In his message to me he wrote:

I still distribute the Paradox plans for Matt Layden at a cost of $40,
which includes postage anywhere in the world. Payments can
be made by check, cash or Paypal at mbolduc@triad.rr.com. The plans
consist of 12 pages of nicely detailed drawings on 11" x 17" paper;
however, they do not include any step-by-step instructions. Therefore, I'd
recommend that you get Don Elliott's Paradox Builders manual, which will give you
an excellent idea of what is involved in this intermediate boat building
project.
