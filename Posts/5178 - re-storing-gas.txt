This is a good location for the motor to clear any fouling problems (It is where I put my electric o/b). But it can't stay there if you intend to do any exhilarating sailing unless you can waterproof it. On a fast reach the lee rail is often nearly submerged.

Look at the stability curve. When sailing well to windward in a F3 the angle of heel is about 20 degrees.

If I was carrying fuel I would keep it on the aft deck up against the cabin window - clear of sailing gear and waves.

Hoping for calm nights
