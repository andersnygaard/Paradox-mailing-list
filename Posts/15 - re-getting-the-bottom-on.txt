Subject: Re: Getting the bottom on

Hi Chris,

Getting the bottom on is not a problem if you start at the stern and screw it down about every 5 inches with sheet rock screws working up both sides a little at a time. For the sides, start in the middle and work toward the ends. Chris, I can't overemphasize the value of Don Elliott's Building instructions. I don't use nails because the epoxy is driven out of the joint while hammering, nor do I leave fasteners in after the epoxy cures because they attract moisture during their heating and cooling from the surrounding wood and are a source of rot. After removing screws the hole is clear coated with epoxy using a pipe cleaner and then the holes are filled using a syringe and thickened epoxy. Ever wondered why having a boat built was so expense? To do it right is a very laborious task. This subject is worth elaborating on and I will post an article on it in the near future.
