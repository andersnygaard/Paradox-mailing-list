In the chilly UK during this April a little charcoal
burning stove would be very welcome.

Thirty years ago I built a YM Goosander 23 footer and
fitted a small cast iron stove which burnt those oval
compressed coal thingies. I lived aboard all one
winter at Poole and the cabin was always toasty
inside.
That stove was too big for a Paradox - about a foot
high and nine inches wide with a length of scaffold
pole for a flue.

I'm sure there is  room in a Paradox for a tiny home
built heater. Could perhaps be made from 3 or 4 inch
diameter copper or stainless tubing with a 1 inch, or
so, diameter flue pipe.

But you'd have to be careful not to get a spark onto
you're inflatable mattress...;-)
