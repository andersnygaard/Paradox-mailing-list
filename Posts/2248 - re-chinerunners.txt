If you look att the full scale drawings of the serie of sections of
the chine runners, then there is a "downward convexity" curvature with
a rdius of about 15mm. When the boat slides sideways, wouldn't the
sharp "upper" angle make it easier for tripping than if the other way
around, "upward convexity"? Well, I don't know.
