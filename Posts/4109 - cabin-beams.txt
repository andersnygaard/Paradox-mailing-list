I've marked out my chipboard for the production of the cabin beam jig, but studying sheet 10 has raised a few questions.

It would appear that i will need to fabricate the following beams:
6 cabin top beams and 3 hatch cover beams.

Now unlike the deck beams, there appears to be quite a bit of variation of sizes for the cabin beams, in fact only 3 appear to be of the same dimensions. Am I correct in assuming the following

1.The foremost cabin beam would appear to be 22mm by approx 44mm with a beveled fore and aft face. I assume the forward facing bevel will need to be picked up from the work after building the cabin framework. (rear bevel not critical)

2. There are 2 aft cabin beams the lower one again 22mm x approx 72mm with an aft face critical bevel. The upper one is notched to "lock the hatch shut. Do you recommend the notch is routed out from a full sized beam or laminate it up with the notch in the right place?

3. Similarly at the forward hatch opening the forward face is notched to take the weather seal. Again is it easier just to route this out from a full size beam?

Hope the questions aren't to daft!

TIA
