Hi,

Just posted three photos of my dry fit.  A couple of my hopes confirmed.

1. The mast, spars and yuloh all fit nicely inside the boat.
2. The cabin length is just right to exactly fit an air bed, so I won't slide around when trying to sleep in rougher conditions.

One thing that I already knew would be true is that getting through to the forepeak is a bit of struggle. It will be a very dark hole in there once the deck is installed. Whatever you stored up there, you wouldn't want to be using very often.

Cheers,

Rob.
