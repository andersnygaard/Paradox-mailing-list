Subject: Re: A Delicate question when cruising

I've actually used the "sawdust" style of toilet at home for a few days when my regular toilet was out of commision during a waste line replacement project.  I just put some sawdust from my table saw in a 5 gallon bucket that was lined with a plastic bag.  Then I put a seat on top, and everything was good to go.  After each "movement" I dusted the waste down with a fresh layer of sawdust, and the toilet was ready for use again.  I have to admit that I was surprised how well the sawdust absorbed the odors.  At the end of the day, the bag with the waste was pitched in the garbage can. I think this method would work fine on a boat, provided you had a ready supply of sawdust and a place to get rid of the waste.
