Al, Thank you for the help and advice. I plan to make as many of the exterior bits before finishing the hull. Right now I have all the bulkheads cut out and should have all the deck beams and cleats finished this week. Just a couple more years and I will be sailing my own Paradox. William

That's the spirit!
