Hi,

The sealants I have used with success are indeed silicone based, but they don't come in any color but black for UV protection of the silicone. You can look at FiX200 or FS 200. Here's a helpful guide on acrylic and polycarbonate windows: https://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/wh1.thewebconsole.com/wh/8/images/Acrylic-and-Polycarbonate-Window-Guide-16.pdf
