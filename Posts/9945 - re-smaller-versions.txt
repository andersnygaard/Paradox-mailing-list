Hello Molly,

I met Andre years ago to see his two Paradox boats, and that was when he introduced me to his Gorfnik designed boat - he is very generous to sharing his knowledge and experience regarding these boats.

We took his Gorfnik and his friend's Gorfnik out for a sail in Canada. I loved the design and boat that I started building one when I arrived home in the US.

The Paradox, Enigma, and Gorfnik are related in many ways, yet, each has their own valuable distinct attributes.

Thank you for your interest in the community. I look forward to reading your progress in your quest for the boat you desire. Please share when you can.

Sail on,
Deric
