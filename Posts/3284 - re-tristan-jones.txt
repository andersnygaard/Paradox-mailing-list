Subject: Re: Tristan Jones

Actually anyone interested in Tristan Jones should read "Wayward Sailor in Search of the real Tristan Jones" by Anthony Dalton. It is an incredibly well researched biography of Tristans life and a wonderful read in it's self. It puts to rest just how much BS Tristan spewed, ICE was complete BS as an example, while giving credit to the fact that he was a master story teller.

I have always loved reading his works and getting caught up in the stories but for the most part, theyre just that. A better teller of sea stories is hard to find. He was pretty much a master mariner and a lot of good info on seamanship is to be had between the covers of his books.
