I don't own a paradox, but I read on another post how they're designed to have the bow well in the water. If your bow is riding high, that's going to move your CE aft and give you lee helm. I know from owning a potter that was designed to carry weight in the cuddy, if you didn't get the weight far enough forward in the boat. it wouldn't get it's chine in the water and sailed much more poorly to windward. Out of balance possibly?

Hi,

Recently I sailed in a wooden boat regatta , as part of the local annual wooden boat show 
I thought I would be the slowest of all the boats entered , I was certainly the smallest 
I kept up easily and even overtook two others , it was a surprise to me

My question is this 
My tiller is always active , there is hardly a moment when , especially at speed , that the tiller is still , it's very tiring . Always pulling it one way or the other , sometimes by large amounts . Rather than use the rope steering as per Matt's design I've extended the tiller into the cabin , with a crude pole , it's still not a final solution but it works , my hands were getting very sore on the ropes , as I never seem to be able to just set and forget the rudder steering .

Is the boats balance incorrect , am I too heavy aft ?

Has any one noticed steering problems with a Paradox , " out of balance "

Hope some one has a cure
