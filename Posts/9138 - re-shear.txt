I too had a battle fitting the sheer strakes (and, worse still, the chine logs). I eventually got them in with a bit of steaming and then made sure they stayed there with lots of epoxy. 

I suspect that Matt also had problems as he suggests laminating them as an acceptable method. That is what I would do if I built another one.
