To Christian: Var finns du? Jag bor i G=F6teborg och skall precis best=E4lla ritningar och bygghandbok...

For the non-Swedish members of the list, the above translates into: Where are You? I live in Gothenburg and is about to order the booklet and the drawings...

Kind regards, Karl

Hello overybody. I would like to announce my intentions to build aParadox boat. She will be called Martha.

At this point i am VERY early into the build. I have the building guide and am eagerly awaiting the plans' that might come in a week our two (Our three). I am a first time boat builder althou i have participated in kayak builds and have built one on my own if that counts.

I am also kind of new to sailing having had a 13 year break from itthat i have somewhat regretted the whole time. Dident do much sailingback then either but am really looking forward to it.

I live in sweden So most of the please help me poasts will probableybe due to the language barrier. My spoken english is ok buth i amhaving problems with (especially american) coloquialisms. I eaven hadto look up what brass brads were. I recognised them emedietly wen isaw them, gues that was one of those Rumsfeldian unknown knowns.

And if there is any swedish Paradox builders out there i would love tocorrespond, i know there is at least one of you :)

Best regards to all

Christian. Skjutare.
