Subject: Re: Bloody chine logs AGAIN!

Thanks to all who replied.
I wasn't going to do anything until I'd seen what Nels had to say.

Al pointed out in an email that the external chine runners also add strength to this side & bottom joint. He also suggested that Matt's experiences (ice bound, Gulf Stream knock down, filthy weather) would have led to him developing a very strong build.

My proposed usage is a circumnavigation of the UK taking the time to explore the rivers and creeks of England and Wales, and particularly those with a tie to historical invasion or settlement. Severn, Deben, Fal & Medway are obvious ones given the current state of my Bronze to Iron Age knowledge. 
My main interest is in seaborne peoples coming here so I will miss out Scotland. That also saves me from having to round Cape Wrath :0) 
Islands are important in my plans so I see my longest possible offshore journey being Eire to England or Wales, probably via Man. If I pick my weather carefully and use my motor thoughtfully I expect to be safe. After all, it has been crossed in skin covered boats and, more recently, in kayaks. 
Thus I believe that a slightly lighter build of paradox should cause no concern.
Just off to fit in a 19mm sapele chine log.
Any correspondence on my plans is welcome.
