Subject: yuloh and pivot questions

I'm looking for some suggestions regarding the yuloh and its pivot bolt.  

The plans specify a 30mm longitudinal concavity. Is this a 30mm offset from a straight line connecting one end of the yuloh to the other end? Or, is the 30mm "offset" from one end of the "blade" portion of the yuloh to the other end of the "blade?"  

Also, I'd appreciate ideas on forging the pivot bolt which mounts atop the stern. I have a friend who is handy with oxy/acetelyene. Can the head of a stainless steel or silicon bronze lag bolt be built up by melting another piece of ss/sb onto it? I notice in Bill's recent posts of Al's "Little Jim" a very shapely yuloh pivot.  

Lastly, how about shaping the portion of the pivot joint which is embedded in the yuloh. I bought an acorn nut with intentions of grinding it to a fairly smooth concave surface, but would appreciate hearing how others have approached this or plan to do so.

Thanks in advance,
Steve
