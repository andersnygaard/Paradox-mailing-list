Update from Mrs. Pelican:

~23:00,(Sat.) Pelican made it to Ft. Clinch. However, he came in on the Atlantic side, and a wave caught him sideways and flipped the boat. He says he is fine and there are some folks helping him get the boat off the sandbar and up on dry land. The close up on his SPOT showed him in a parking lot. He says he'll wait till AM to see what the damage is. I'm not sure if he is there for the night or will try to make it to the camp site. At least he's safe and on dry land! Details to follow.Mrs. Pelican
