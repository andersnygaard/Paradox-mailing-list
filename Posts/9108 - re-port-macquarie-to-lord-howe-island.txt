I live in Adelaide and have a two year old paradox with some experience in it
Are you a tall person is my first thought ?
Off shore it's ok and feels safe
Giant waves are another thing
I've been on my side twice , once deliberately and once by accident
The accidental case was a 120 degree roll and I got shoved along and the hatch was open and I took water and lost some gear
The boat will go 6 knots flat out
4 is an average on a mildly windy day
Can you carry enough gear and enough drinking water
And have you been knocked down at sea ?
