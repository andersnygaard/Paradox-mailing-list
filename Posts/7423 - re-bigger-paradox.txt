Subject: Re: Bigger Paradox

Hi Glen, 

that's exactly what I think, one can rebuild any kind of boat, one just have to know what to do...
I really like the advice from people which have the actual boat, because they are the best to judge whats good and what not! And if those people have a boat building background , perfect!
I know there are for sure better boats but I just like the Paradox so much.....
I still have plenty of time to do my research, because this year I am in Alaska &amp; Canada on a Trip anyway, so I will start building the boat in early 2014...
Thanks to the Forum I have a lot of pictures to look at and can think about how to outfit my Paradox! Gosh, boats are fun.....

Regards Chris

No Problem Chris,
     As someone who has actually built and sailed a paradox and know 
 Matt Layden personally I can assure you that you would have his 
 blessing. He once told me that Paradox was infinitely scale-able (the 
 caveat is having the knowledge to know how to address the myriad 
 problems associated with an increase in scale). As a former professional 
 boat builder I understand how to move bulkheads and where to add needed 
 support in new areas and how to calculate new sail area and how to 
 adjust displacement in order to maintain displacement ratios etc. I'm 
 truly surprised at the number of people who will weigh in with advise on 
 a subject without doing any real research on or really knowing what they 
 are talking about. Be aware also of the academics who possess knowledge 
 with no practical experience. Theory is fine until you get out there and 
 find it doesn't apply to your situation. Only through experience, which, 
 judging by your website, you have in spades, can you truly begain to 
 understand what is important to your situation and what is not. Good 
 luck on your upcoming adventure, I for one applaud you.
Glen
