(aka batejarcat) or his 20% stretched Paradox Max Manatee?  I just happened to be looking through the photos and realized the very thorough job on his hull was very nearly complete over a year ago (windows, finishing, foils, rig still needed).  He seemed to have resolved his epoxy skin rash; and the speed he was moving, I was sure he'd be in the water before now.  No photos or messages since Feb 2014, if I'm not mistaken.
