I had this bending problem originally, I solved it by drilling bigger pilot holes. Even with quite large holes it was impossible to get the nails out again. Try a few test pieces.

I found the pilot hole sizes on the Classic Marine website and added one sixty-fourth of an inch. Now they go in perfectly; through the ply and into the Sapele.
