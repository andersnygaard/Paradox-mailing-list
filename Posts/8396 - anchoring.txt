Subject: Anchoring
To: paradoxbuilders@yahoogroups.com

Hello All. Tomorrow evening is likely my first night out in my Paradox. I have spent quite a bit of time trying to figure out how I'm going to anchor but I have not resolved it just yet. My paradox has an area on the bow that will "hold" an anchor line (an S cut in pipe), but I can't really get to the front deck to anchor anyway. I have thought about various schemes to have a loop or pull to bring back the rode and anchor for handling at the stern too. So experienced Paradox anchorpeople, please enlighten me?
