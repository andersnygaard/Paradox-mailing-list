Alright! Thanks man. Going to barnes and nobles tommorow I will look for it. Also picking up "101 Rigs". Stephen, have you been able to go sailing in your paradox yet? The last I recall you were almost finished with your build.

The Title of this book is. SELF-STEERING UNDER SAIL by Peter Christian Forthmann. This book was a present from my daughter. I recomend this book because it is very thorough. I covers both auto pilots and selfsteering systems for sailboats. I details good and bad points of each. I describes very well, and with diagrams and photos, ALL, the different designs. There is enough information to allow most boat builders to make a nice one, in my opinion. About 80% of the pages deal with windvane systems. 20% with autopilot. It has technical specifications for 12 types of windvane steering systems. Good Luck, Steve Yahn
PS. I have never built or used one myself.
