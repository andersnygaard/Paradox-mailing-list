Subject: Re: pdf, dfx or svg plans for building a model Paradox - any available?

If the 2D CAD file would work, I scaled that drawing down to 1 tenth scale and then turned it into a PDF file put in the files section where the CAD files were.

I didn't try this but it should work.  I used QCAD to make the changes and convert it to a printable PDF.
