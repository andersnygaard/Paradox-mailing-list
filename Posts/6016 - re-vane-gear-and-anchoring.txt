Subject: Re: Vane Gear and Anchoring

Anyone else putting a vane on their Paradox? Also, I am planning some sailing that will require anchoring using a fair amount of chain. Do any of you Paradox sailors have any experience storing and dragging chain through the boat? I am considering adding a chain pipe that would be sealed when underway. Any thoughts?

Cheers,

Mark

You probably will not need a lot of chain - 4 metres of chain with a 30 metre anchor warp should cover most contingencies. Take a minimum of 2 anchors along with their warps and chains.

Hi Glen and everyone,

I am making great progress with my vane. In fact, I am working on two models - an upside down and a conventional to test which works best. For the Walt Murray inspired USD system, I am wondering whether you used to 5" X 32" X 9" dimensions specified on his site. I read somewhere that you were having problems with light air performance and am wondering whether to make allowance for a larger vane. Perhaps it would be a good idea to be able to switch back and forwards between a larger and a smaller vane depending on wind conditions?

What are your thoughts on this issue?

Thanks,

Mark
