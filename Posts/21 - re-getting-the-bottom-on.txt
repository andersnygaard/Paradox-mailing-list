Hi Glen, the spacing is for the size of the nail, big nails are spaced further apart, that is, at 70mm and small nails are spaced at 40mm. Big nails go in big stuff, small nails go in little stuff.
The smaller nails need to be closer as they are weaker, and need to be spaced close for strength. The large nails grip strongly and can be further apart. 
    Big nail go into large lumber, Small nails go into smaller lumber. Large nails will split wood if spaced to close togeather. 
    It is a good idea to have the nails preinstalled in the panel before it is put in place this speed up the assembly time, this is no time for fumbling. Don
