Thanks, that explains a lot. From the pictures I'd seen, I thought the gooseneck was rigid in the side axis, and I couldn't understand how the deck fitting could stand up to that long moment arm without ripping the screws right out of the deck. I guess that line leading upward from the forward end of the roller fitting was part of a topping lift? If so, is it normally under some tension to relieve some of the strain on the sail?
