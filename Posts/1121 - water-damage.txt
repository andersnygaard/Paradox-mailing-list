Hi All,

The second re-fit of Whisper is going great, Im working on the inside now. Im not sure whether to coat the inside with Epoxy, since there was water damage at one time. I don't want to trap any water that might still be there. I believe she is dry, she has been drying for about a year now. Any thoughts?
