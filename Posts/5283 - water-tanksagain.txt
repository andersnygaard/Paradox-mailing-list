Subject: Water tanks..again..
Date: Sun, 03 Aug 2008 17:43:45 -0000

I plan on building my paradox design exactly as per plan. Useing Don Elliott's book. However, with the water tanks I will build them as plan for a back-up system, but I was wondering if before I put the tops on, I could insert a custom made RV plastic (whatever they use) fresh water tank in each area. I have seen some small Rv's with several small water tanks place throughout and was wondering if anyone has tried this. 

I think they can be custom ordered inexpensively. Or what about Freshwater bladder bags as some boats use in hulls... has someone experimented or tried these for a Paradox? If I place them in that same location as original plans and make epoxy tanks as well per plan then if I get a leak in the Rv tank or bladder bag all is contained within original tanks. 

Would like Pros and cons feedback on this.

Thanks,
Rod
