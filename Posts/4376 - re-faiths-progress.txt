Looking good Bill.
Looks like you will be afloat long before me.
Managed today to finish the chine runners and glass there underneath. Covered the glass with PeelPly to get a smother finish and reduce work later.
Tomorrow I will try and start work on the hatch.
This coming week I hope to take delivery of my new trailer. Its a combi and rated at about 500 lbs.
Will be ideal for using with NOLI and my dory rowing skiff. 
As soon as the trailer arrives I will plonk NOLI on and post a picky.
I am still hoping to be afloat with NOLI by the end of July but I have just had a bit of extra drawing work thrown at me. Still it's money.
