Hi Ben,

Well done on sorting a bit of suitable timber at a suitable price. From potentially =C2=A3200 to =C2=A317, not an inconsiderable saving. With savings like that you could build another boat in seven years.

However, the fibreglass work should keep moisture out, 100% so no rot anyway.....if you make a good job of it. There is now also a fibreglass resin called vinalester resin that fits between polyester resin and epoxy resin. Price wise it also fits between the two, but one of its special properties is water proofness. Check it out. Good luck with the build.
