Subject: Paradox Owners/Builders

I have updated the Paradox Builders and Owners page at http://www.smallsailboats.co.uk/paradox/names.htm but there are several bits of information missing such as who is the new owner of `Enuf' or is Bengt Genell's Paradox built according to plan and there's no information about Jeff Forrest's boat, except that he lives in the US. Does Jeff have 2 `r's in his surname?

The list is far from being complete, so if you can forward information to me at barnacleid@yahoo.co.uk I would be grateful.

Thank you,
Bill.
