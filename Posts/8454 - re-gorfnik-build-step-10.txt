Hi all, 

I posted a drawing of a leeboard for Gorfnik. I'm pretty sure it isn't exactly like the original but it is as close as I can get looking at the pictures and dimensions provided. Should work.

I included the radius of all the rounded corners but they are likely to end up being whatever round can or lid is laying around that looks about right or done entirely by eye using a sander. Most of them are just for looks anyway. If it looks right, it probably is.

You should round the forward side (at least the underwater part). The thickest point should be a third of the width (around 3-1/8" - 3-3/16") from front side. The rear side should taper almost to a point.
