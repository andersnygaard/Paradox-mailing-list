Hi All,

Working on a Wooden Boat is Like working on An Old House the more you dig the more you find. In grinding the Glass off the bottom I found some rot. It was in a void in the ply. It went about half way through, I dug out the soft wood and treated it per Dave Carnel;s instructions. I followed the void drilling 3/16 holes and injecting antifreeze. I plan to inject epoxy in the holes and filling the rest with epoxy putty. Do I need to do anything else? Also there are some spot's That are questionable I plan on drilling about half way through to check it out,  if the wood is sound, Fill it with epoxy. Anything else I should do?

Thanks 
David
