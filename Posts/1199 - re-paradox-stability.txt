Al, I have been sailing Zoe with empty water tanks the last few outings and find that she is a little more tender but it does not effect her stability that much. Had her out in 16kts yesterday with about a foot of sail rolled in and she did just fine. You might want to give it a try, beats emptying the tanks all the time.

Do the chine runners provide sufficient lateral resistance in light wind speeds when the boat is not fully loaded? I assume you are not using water ballast in order to keep up with the Minisail, or are you? How much does the boat weigh in the configuration shown? I'm wondering how the boat works for just playing around in by the beach, versus actually cruising anywhere.

I have never tried sailing without the water ballast, and as far as I can tell, with some cunning use of the bathroom scales, I have the displacement with one crew at the required 1400lb. I suspect the stability would suffer if it were significantly lighter.
In light or strong winds leeway has never been a problem.

I think the weight would mitigate against using it as a beach toy. You would have to keep your toes out from under it for a start.
I have come to the conclusion that you have to think of it as a yacht, not a dinghy. (The sums class it as heavy displacement)

Hoping for calm nights
