Yeah, I thought about the efficiency. If I went this route, the generator would be a back up to a solar trickle charger (you can get ones that charge a singel 12V battery for $30 or so). I just want quiet controlled propulsion for navigating tight spaces (docks, boat ramps). If I ever did a "real" crossing, I think I would want a motor so I could move quickly if near a shipping lane at night.
