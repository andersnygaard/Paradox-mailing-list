Well it's one of the few modifications that I have made. I'm not sure how well it will work out, but if I'm not happy I can make the rear window a permanent fixture again!

It's led to quite a bit more work which I wouldn't have had if I'd just followed the plans. I was actually working on this today. It has a labyrinth type seal so should be pretty watertight, but not as secure as the original design. As I said, if I'm not happy I'll replaced it with a permanent fixture.
