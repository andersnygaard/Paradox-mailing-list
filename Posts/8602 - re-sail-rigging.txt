Hi , sailing adventure number three was fun , 12 nautical miles in 41 C degree heat
Dead calm , till lunchtime then ten knots or so all afternoon
Sailed for two hours home motored for four hours outbound
The German made electric outboard is fine if you only use it at very slow speeds
The battery lasts and lasts , I like it , quiet , powerful enough , no petrol smells

The sail with a new aluminium yard flew full , no taper on this set up  , good and stiff , no folds in the full set sail , lightweight . I'm thinking of changing the boom now to an aluminium one , I've managed to buy a length of high tensile 1.5 mm thick 50 mm tube , manufactured for the trucking industry .

While sailing this week , I took the chance to test the stability again , in a following sea and dead tail wind , close to shore
I threw the tiller hard over and the boat swung quickly , heeled a fair bit , all well so far
Then the sail lifted and the boom went upright alongside the mast and parallel to it
Sail then Wrapped around the mast and flew atop the mast head in. "Y " shape
All folded and out of shape
Releasing the haulyards and pulling the main sheet had it flying properly in no time
Another lesson about tacking or jibing with the sail set full and by
Tighten the main  sheet early before turning

Hope others are getting their boats wet too
