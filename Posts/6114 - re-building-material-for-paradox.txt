The composite that Sven is building with is probably about 10X as expensive as using plywood, plus he has free (sponsored) access to such things as autoclaves and forging expertise (witness the bronze keel and custom rudder fittings etc). But he is planning to sail across the Atlantic,  around the horn and perhaps beyond to Japan if all goes well.

Paradox was designed for plywood contruction as that was the most viable for Matt's pocket book at that time. I expect it fits with most of our pocket books as well.
