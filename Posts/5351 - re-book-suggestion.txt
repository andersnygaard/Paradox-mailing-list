I see. Does your mast fit completly inside. I thought I read somewhere that with the anchor light and lightning rod it was a bit too long to fit all the way in. When I tried to fit mine inside I considered drilling a hole into the Stem block for it to fit into. Not all the way thru, just enough. I'll have to re visit that part. It will be easier now that I have a trailer to put the boat on.
