Subject: [paradoxbuilders] New Pictures For Paradox Phans!

I just received a copy of Sven Yrvind's new book KONSTRUKTOREN.  It is one of those books that you're glad to own not just because of the information contained therein, but because the illustrations and layout show that the book was a labor of love.  

I've posted some illustrations from the book that Paradoxers may find interesting.  The picture of Sven's current project was drawn by none other than Matt Layden.  The other illustrations are by Martin Morck.

I encourage everyone to seek out this book.  Look for it at: prisma@prismabok.se  ISBN 91-518-4154-1

Pictures are in LONGYARD folder: http://photos.groups.yahoo.com/group/paradoxbuilders/lst?&amp;.dir=3D/Longyard&amp;.src=3Dgr&amp;.view=3Dt&amp;.url=3Dhttp%3a//us.f1.yahoofs.com/groups/g_3590474/Longyard/Latest%2bBris%2bconcept.%2b4.05mtrs..jpg%3fbcRSr7uBP2pX1DIx&amp;.cx=3D108&amp;.cy=3D150&amp;.type=3Du

Yours,
