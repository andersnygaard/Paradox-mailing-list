Subject: Re: Spar storage

I remove the furling axle by loosening the screw a couple of turns (I am not convinced that the screw is actually necessary).

I have to travel a couple of hours to my usual sailing grounds so the security of not having anything loose to worry about is good.

However, I store them in my garage at home as it would be difficult to work on, or even load for a trip, with the spars inside.

Sun damage is not usually a problem where I sail :-(

Hoping for calm nights
