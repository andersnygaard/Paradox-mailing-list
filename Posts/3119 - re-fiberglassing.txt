Phil, I'm not going to attempt to answer your question, like you I 
am currently building a Paradox, but what I would appreciate is an e-mail from you giving details for the following web page - that's if you want to be included.

If there are others not mentioned on this site who would want to be included, please could you contact me.

My e-mail address is:  william@serjeant5445.fslife.co.uk 

Many thanks,

Bill.
