I am part way through building my Paradox. It is my first real boat. I have built an 8 foot pram dinghy about 12 years ago and a canoe many years before that at school. What has encouraged me to take on this project as my first (and probably only) real boat is that the design allows you to check your work before committing yourself. Take the side panels, for instance. They are temporarily assembled to the bulkheads while the bevels are all checked, then dissassembled for the final bonded assembly. Then the bottom gets the same treatment, then the deck. If at any stage something isn't going to fit you will know in time to correct it. not like (I imagine) a planked boat where you have to fix them to see if they fit.

Does that make sense? It has been a long day.

I own a set of paradox plans and i have never built a boat. However i have no intention of building paradox yet, i just ordered plans for a 12' signet dory from selway fisher and whilst i have read countless books on how to build boats and i know exactly what to do. I think im going to struggle the first time while i make all my mistakes, i will probably struggle on my 2nd and third dingies aswell. Then i will be confident enough to tackle paradox. I think there is a difference between knowing how to do something and being caipable of doing it.
That said, im sure others would have no problem with paradox as there first boat, i guess its just a question of breaking down the complicated overall thing into a series of smaller more manageable jobs.
