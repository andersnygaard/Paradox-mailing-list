Um... weight and displacement are not quite the same thing. Displacement is
the weight of water that a boat displaces and isn't the same as the weight
of the boat herself.

If the boat is 600# and the human is 250# and one added another 250# of
stores, then the boat's 'trailer weight' would be 1100#. Given that humans
that are likely to be comfortable in a Paradox aren't likely to weigh 250#,
and 250# for stores is a lot of groceries, maybe 1000# for a loaded Paradox
isn't so far off the mark :)
