I've uploaded 5 photos of what is the making of SaSa so far, including a curved transom (boomkin yet to be built) and above deck tiller for (bungy and sheet to tiller) self-steering. I started SaSa on the 9th of June so tomorrow will be two months later. The last thing I made in wood was a shoe rack, at school 47 years ago. I no longer have that shoe rack.
