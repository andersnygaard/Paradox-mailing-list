Subject: Paradox Chine Runners ?

Would be interested in hearing from Paradox sailors as to how effective the Chine Runners are compared to typical center/dagger board.

In process of modifying a Mirror Dinghy for Open Boat beach camping type cruising. Would like to remove the dagger board and replace with Chine Runners. Biggest question is since the Mirror weighs only 150 lbs. +/- will they be as effective on the Mirror as they are on the heavier Paradox?

Also .... what is the cross section of the runners on the Paradox? And what is the angle they are mounted from the bottom of the boat? In photos it looks like 45 eg. approx.

Thanks.
