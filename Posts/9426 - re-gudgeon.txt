Subject: Re: gudgeon

Hello Sybe34, 

Using epoxy to fasten a gudgeon is typically not a preferred method because it makes it difficult to remove the parts apart. A product that is a sealant with adhesive qualities in combination with bolts is considered sufficient for fixing the gudgeon to the boat.

I am the owner of Don Elliott's boat build, and I see he did not use epoxy to fasten the gudgeon to the boat.

Let us know if you decide differently.
