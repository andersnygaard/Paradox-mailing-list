Subject: Re: Bloody chine logs AGAIN!

I agree Jack and this has been discussed previously. Lighter chine logs and fillets should be really strong. I think it is more work though. Chine logs with a triangular cross section and taped over would also make a strong stiff joint, easier to keep clean, and use less wood. Not sure how it would work during the Paradox sequence of construction.
