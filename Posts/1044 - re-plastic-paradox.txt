Hi Kjell,

I am just wondering if you are aware of the "other" site that discuses Bris and Paradox?

http://groups.yahoo.com/group/microcruising/

In the files section at that site there is a folder with several photos and diagrams of Svend's designs. They were posted by Bjorn Harbo of Oslo, who has met Sven on a few occasions. Do you know about Bjorn? He just finished building a schooner from a Phil Bolger plan of which I have several photos I can send if you are interested.

From my recollection, Bjorn mentioned that Sven really looked at a lot of the Paradox features and even build a Bris type using plywood and various types of cloth laminates. However he went back to a divinycell sandwich because he wanted an essentially indestructable hull which was admittedly according to himself much more than was needed. This was partly because of his experience with a least two other Atlantic crossings from his previous designs. So he had his reputation to protect as well.

Obviously if one is going to risk their life in an Atlantic crossing in a small boat the cost per sqare foot of materials is not a big deal. However for the type of cruising most of us envision the plywood epoxy glass sandwich is plenty strong.

For the record, when it comes to cost vs. strength in a monohull, Bolger estimates that steel is by far the most economical and then aluminum I think.

If you have not talked to Bjorn, you might want to contact him as he is very interested to meet Swedes who know Sven. That is because we all want his book translated to English! and Bjorn's Svensk isn't the best:-)

Cheers, Nels
