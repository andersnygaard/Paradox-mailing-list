Steve,

I'm sure Jimmy will answer you, but in the meantime you may want to check out http://www.simplicityboats.com/yulohpage.html which has lots of interesting info on the yuloh and the Ro.

Also, are you aware that Jimmy has a blog and details the building of his new Yuloh here:

and
http://tw.myblog.yahoo.com/fi156-storch/article?mid=3D-2&amp;prev=3D2904&amp;l=3Da&amp;fid=3D31

I plug these urls into Google translator (or any of the others) to make some sort of sense out of it. It certainly makes for an unusual read!

By the way Steve your boat looks great. We're looking forward to hearing of your launch.

Pete
