Subject: Re: CHINE RUNNERS ON A SUPER PELICAN

I can give an opinion. It will work poorly. The 18'pelican has flaring sides. You need nearly vertical sides. You need a narrow hull. the 18'pelican is not. You need a heavy and deep hull. The 18'pelican is not. The whole concept of the chine runners must be incorporated into the design from the moment of creation, not added on like a patch. Thats my opinion.

Subject: CHINE RUNNERS ON A SUPER PELICAN

 HI ALL  (AGAIN) - 
 
   LET ME START AT THE BEGINNING.... I AM WORKING ON THE REDESIGN OF THE SAN FRANCISCO PELICAN - THE 18' SUPER PELICAN MODEL.   I'VE GOT EVERYTHING IN PLACE (AT LEAST I BELIEVE THERE IN PLACE).           
    NOW HERE'S  MY PROPLEM.   I WANT TO ADD "CHINE-RUNNERS AND GET RID OF THAT TREMENDOUS CENTERBOOARD.  ICAN DRAW IT UP OK BUT I NEED SOME INPUT FROM "PARADOX" BUILDER AS TO ITS PHASABILATIES.  NOW THAT YOU'VE BUILT YOUR BOATS DO YOU THINK THE CHINE-RUNNERS CAN BE TRANSFERED TO ANOTHER DESIGN.  IF I LAY THE PELICAN DRAWING OVER THE PARADOX DRAWING THEY JUST ABOUT MATCH (CHINES).
     I WOULD APPRECIATE ANY INPUT (GOOD OR BAD) ABOUT WHAT I'M TRYING.
 
                        THANKS ALL - ALOHA - JACK SPOERING- ocala, fl
