Thank-you, As I am in the end phase this comforts me alot because there is such 
a controversy over this design. I chose it on faith. Or rather on Faith, the 
word of the actual paradox owners rather than the experiance of others. I have 
found that building this boat is easier than the Sea Bee 13 sof kayak I just 
built. I am no woodworker and have discovered thats ok because the Paradox 
basically teaches you how to build it. At first the plans are overwhelming, but 
once you begin to build (on faith, just one step at a time) the design begins to 
talk to you and you just know what to do. This is very difficult thing to 
explain and it may happen with every DIY project, I don't know as this DIY is a 
new path for me. 

P.S. I have also had alot of wonderful help from this forum and the peeps 
here. Thank-you all again.

Rod

Hello All,

While I was building my paradox I was skeptical to say the least about the 
likely performance of the design. Since my paradox was completed, I've ventured 
into some pretty wild conditions and every time have found Small Fry to perform 
very well. Having had quite a bit of experience by now, I am beginnning to 
appreciate the degree of experience which Matt has incorporated into his design. 
Years later I am still discovering every detail of the paradox, no matter how 
simple it may appear, has had plenty of thought given to it. For what it may be 
worth, my advice to those who are not sure, you should trust Matt as a designer, 
he knows what he's doing, and his suggestions about the paradox's designed 
performance do work out in real life conditions. Not only has Matt designed a 
sea worthy boat, but he has carefully thought through the building process and 
consequently the building process is not difficult. There is more detail and 
instruction included in his plans than some other well known designers who's 
plans I've been able to examine. If you stick closely to his design and resist 
the temptation to deviate the result will be good. 

Cheers,
Geoff (Small Fry, Australia).
