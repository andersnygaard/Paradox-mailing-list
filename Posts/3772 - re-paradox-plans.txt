Check out Duckworks at duckworksmagazine.com. Chuck Leinweber who runs the place and also sells Jim's plans in addition to John Welsford and several others was one of the competitors in the Frolic2. If you want to see what small boats can handle in experienced hands, go to watertribe.com and review some of the past races. Matt Leyden  raced Paradox one year and Enigma this year.

Hi Ron

Give me their email and I will.
If your point is that you can do anything in anything I agree with you; somewhat. 
Can you indicate where Michalak's designs, which I like very much, are coastal cruising 
over long distances, single handed, regularly?
It is surely better to start with something suited for purpose?

Cheers
