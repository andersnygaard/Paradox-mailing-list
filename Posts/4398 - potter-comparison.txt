Jeff,

I have an early C-Type Potter and it is a great little boat.  Two years ago I took her for an overnight excursion in Palacios Bay, Texas and drew her up on a sandy beach for the night.  About 2:00 a.m. I was awakened by a grinding sound and the gurgling of water.  As the tide went out Bobber settled on three small pieces of gravel that ground their way through the hull due to the motion of the water.  Had the bottom been just a bit thicker there would have been nothing to worry about.  Because of the weight of the Paradox, I would not consider going to a thinner bottom.  Just my opinion!
