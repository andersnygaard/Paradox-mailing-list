Thanks all for your comments.

Have been away and am going away again, not by Paradox obviously (we're going to DRIVE around the Baltic Sea).

No, Nels, I don't buyandsell dollars very often.

I've been visiting Sven (who sends his greetings). Since Sven doesn't make his own sails and he's my guru, me don't either. His new boat is astonishing, as usual. Every detail meticuously specialmade, carbon fibre... He showed me to a local sailmaker who had a completely different approach, so maybe everything turns out ok.

Among many things I asked him about the curvature of the yuloh. He said it was to move the centre of rotation to the other side of the longitudinal axis.

As to my own project, I've been seeking help at the local smith shop, to drill out, in one way or another, the long bronze rod from the rudder, which happened to be glued tilted... ho-ho-ho One step ahead, two backwards.
