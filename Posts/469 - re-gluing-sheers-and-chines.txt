So you applied glue first, and then fitted the wood. I had visions of the glue going off when the wood was only half in. 

Thanks.

Hi Al, As I recall there was no problem gluing the sheer clamps and chine logs and I did mine during the summer months using slow hardener. You can only do one at a time and the surface area is less then 2 square feet so you shouldn't have a problem. Tailwinds Glen
