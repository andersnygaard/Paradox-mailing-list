Hi Pete

Glad all is going well for you.

The 'Indispension' type units do indeed settle with age. I'm sure my trailer has become lower and the suspension a lot harder over time.

Lowering would be a good thing, as it would enable the boat to float off easier, but the harsh ride that results is the downside. Do you know where these suspension units are manufactured? My guess is that it's somewhere far, far away, in the east where they are less preoccupied with quality and durability.

Hi Jim,
I have indispension type units on my trailer and they seem to offer a fairly soft ride. I was actually surprised after my first trip that my little duck mascot was just where I left him on the front window sill.
So little moves around that I don't even bother wedging stuff down on the shelves. I wonder if the rubber hardens with age and ceases to become an effective damper.

Anyway let's not forget a grand UK Paradox Rally sometime before the summer's over, I launched from Ridge Wharf last week and found it a great spot.
