Subject: mast

May I ask for some advice, please?

I have an aluminium mast from a Skipper 12 dinghy that is in good condition. It is a constant two and three eighths of an inch in diameter along its circular cross section. The wall thickness is one sixteenth of an inch. It is about six inches short but I could easily turn a wooden plug to extend it.

Would it be ok to use for a paradox mast?

Thanks.......Derek
