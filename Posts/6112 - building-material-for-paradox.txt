Dear Members,

I have enjoyed the postings! While reading all I can on Paradox, I have also been following Yrvind's progress as he builds his revolutionary vessel, which owes much to Matt Layden.

Interestingly, he has chosen to enclose it entirely in Divinycell (PVC foam); 2 inches for the hull and something less for the deck house. Is there anyone on this forum who is considering building in the same material?

Best Regards,
