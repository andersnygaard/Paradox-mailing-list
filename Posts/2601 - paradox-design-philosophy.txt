Subject: Paradox design philosophy

You're right, it is. It's a small cat with 8' long houses. But I'm really taken with the ingenuity of the Paradox design, and not just all the terrific ideas that I've been able to observe without a set of plans. There's just something tremendous about the way Paradox has taken its intended purpose and stuck to it, without any regard for offending convention or punditry. It's really a remarkable little boat, but the design philosophy it represents is even more interesting to me.

One of the ideas I'm cheerfully stealing is the inside steering station. I've never seen this on a small multihull, but doesn't it make perfect sense, since cats are moving faster and the wind is stronger and the spray is denser? Anyway, that explains the need for lots of lexan, since the steering station has to be aft to keep the bunk dry.

Thanks,

Ray
