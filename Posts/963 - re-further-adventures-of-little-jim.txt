I won't be leaving Poole till the Sunday, when I hope there will be a little north in the wind. It should be fun whatever happens.

Good luck on your trip.

Alistair, Please ignore the bit in my previous message about being south of the Race or cutting inside - I forgot you are approaching Portland from the east - hence your winds will be on the nose until later in the day.

Sorry about that Bill.  PS Hope you have a great sail.

I'm planning on a trip down the River Crouch in Caleb.
