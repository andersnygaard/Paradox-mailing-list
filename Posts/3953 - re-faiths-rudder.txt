It's looking good Bill, keep going and you will soon be there.

One observation about your rudder. I, and derek, found that with the 
rudder as-designed there was a problem with the lead of the sheet. 
On a broad reach, or when running, on the stbd tack the sheet drops 
into the gap between the rudder stock and the transom. Sail adjustments 
then require the sheet to slide over the top of the 
pintle/gudgeon. I found it advisable to make a small wooden insert to fill this gap and act as a fairlead. It is not essential, but it does make sail adjustment easier.

Good idea.  I'll have a look at it.  Today I fitted the steering line and it works well.

Bill.
