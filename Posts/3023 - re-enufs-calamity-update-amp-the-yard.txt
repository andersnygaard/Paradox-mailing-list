Hi Derek,

One thing to look out for would be chafing against the mast, I know because I had finished my mast in varnish, it created more friction and burned a hole thru my top sail sleeve about 8 inches long. I sewed a leather chafe protector to the top sleeve and Im going to skin the mast and use a petroleum jelly and linseed oil mixture for finish instead of varnish. Bamboo being segmented may pose a problem, unless you can get a segment to fall correctly at the mast. if nothing else it would be noisy as it jumped over the end of the segment.
