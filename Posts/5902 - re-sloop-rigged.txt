Subject: Re: Sloop rigged?

Hi,

Newbie here, so please be gentle!

Been sailing on and off for 26 years, and looking for a cheap,
portable pocket cruiser for weekend sailing in the Lakes etc.

Having looked at Andersons, and Seawytchs, I stumbled across the
Paradox whilst looking into sail canoes.

I very much like the look of this craft, and not averse to putting in
the hours to build one.

And here's the question.

I've done a search through here for sloop rigged Paradox's, found lots
of discussions, but no conclusive statements as to whether the basic
design can be modified to run a sloop rig.

So, can anyone help?

Many thanks,

Matt

There are four major disadvantages with the sloop rig, off the top of my head.

1. It would require a taller mast to raise the same same sail area as
the designed sail plan. The mast might also have to be relocated further
forward.

2. This would require standing rigging to control mast bend and keep the
jib stay taut enough to prevent it from sagging.

3. A sloop rig would require a vang assembly to prevent the boom from
raising.

4. How would the skipper control all the functions of a sloop rig while
sitting comfortably out of the weather and safe  below decks, with no
concern for falling overboard?

Also the ability to instantly "dial in" the amount of reefing to
maintain the most efficient level of heel for best performance would be
lost.
