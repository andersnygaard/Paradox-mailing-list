Yes Indeed Steve You are absolutely right.

There are 2 main reasons.. First all sharpies are basically flat bottomed with similar lines and Second Matt Layden "borrowed heavily" from Phil Bolger's designs.

What that means is all are very seaworthy boats. Paradox is one of the few self righting and self rescuing boats. It would be a scary experience, but Paradox is capable of rolling completely over like a Kayak and right itself. It would likely not even de-mast if one had the for sight to quickly release the halyard.

Paradox is one tough little ship!

Yes I'm a long time in knowing those. When I saw this video I thought "that looks just like a big Paradox sailing" I thought others might enjoy seeing the spread of this "motif"
