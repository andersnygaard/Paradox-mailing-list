Hi Jack,

David Beard mounts his Honda 2.3 on the port side of the transom as shown at:

Is your engine mounted in the same position?

I have been dithering on making a choice whether to mount an engine on 'Faith'.  What's wrong with the starboard side of the transom where it will not be in the way of the sail, boom and yard when they are stowed on the port side?

The biggest problem as I see it, is the sheet fouling the motor while sailing, especially when gybing.

David, how does it work in practice?

Would you be able to add photos of your engine to the photos section showing how you've mounted it?

I appreciate this business of an outboard motor on Paradox is a personal choice, but the more information on the subject, the better it is for those who are undecided.

There are certain instances where an engine can be of enormous help such as when entering or leaving harbours like Dover or Ramsgate where large craft frequently come and go.  In the proximity of the harbour entrances mobility and control of Paradox is essential for safety.  These harbours also have strong tidal currents running off their entrances and the wind can be fluky due to the harbour walls.

I could avoid both Kent ports, but if I'm cruising towards the South West of England from the East Coast, I'm bound to pass them and being able to move smartly when crossing their fairways or holding station near them is important.

You can understand why I'm interested in the possibility of mounting an outboard motor.

Bill.
