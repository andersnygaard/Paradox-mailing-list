Subject: Re: Considering Dingos and Modifying Paradox

Thanks James. Oars could be a solution. They would need to be long and light for stowage on the starboard side in place of the yuloh. Making them to work through ports in the sides of the boat would mean changing the storage shelves on either side, and plugging the oar ports when the oars are not in use could present a problem by putting at risk the waterproof integrity of the boat. Siting the rowlocks either side of the cabin top close to the aft end of the hatch when it is open may be possible. The oarsman would stand facing forwards while pushing the oars to obtain momentum.

Enigma looks to a certain extent like a miniature Paradox and she embodies some of her characteristics such as the chine runners, flat bottom with rocker and box sides, but she is a different boat in that she is a light displacement vessel by comparison with Paradox which is a heavy displacement boat. This means that Enigma relies on her crew's weight as ballast to maintain stability and because of her light displacement she could even plane.

The internal stowage arrangements between the two boats are dissimilar and Enigma does not have a hardtop cabin. Enigma was designed for occasional car-topping and for portaging on land by the use of a simple trolley which is carried on board when sailing. Although at first sight she looks like a small Paradox, she is not a Paradox that has been modified; she is a different boat.

People will play around with the Paradox design, but to my mind they will find it difficult to improve. Matt got it right. When you change things like the sail plan, widening the boat or lengthening the boat, there is a cause and effect situation which means other things need changing. Here I agree with Don Elliott, such a boat is no longer a Paradox, she is a Paradox derivative.
