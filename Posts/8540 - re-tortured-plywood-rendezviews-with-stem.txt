Al,

That is a neat trick. I'll be sheathing the boat, most likely fiberglass. I now know to go a little thicker in that area.

I haven't checked on the cost of spray on liner yet, but Gorfnik makes me want to find out before sheathing.

My previous small boat experience indicates the boat will certainly get damaged.

Respectfully,
Bobby
