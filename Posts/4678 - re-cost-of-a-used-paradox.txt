Subject: Re: Cost of a Used Paradox?

If you were to take into consideration labour costs you would find Paradox quite a pricey boat to buy because she's labour-intensive to build.

In the UK the costs of materials would be in the region of =A34000 ($8000 roughly) to which would be added the cost of a trailer if you wanted one, say another =A31500 ($3000), or secondhand around =A3600 ($1200).

I have a breakdown of the figures for my Paradox that I'll be publishing on my web site when it is updated next month.
