Subject: Re: About Topping Lift

Hi Jimmy,

I made my topping lift so that it holds the boom in the position it is in when the sail is hoist. It is made from a rope at each end of the boom which join and pass through an eye at the top of the mast. You can see some pictures of it in the "Little Jim" folder in the Photos section.

The only disadvantage I have found is that you have to be careful not to get the yard on the wrong side of it when starting to hoist.

Hoping for calm nights,
Al,
Yeovil, England.
