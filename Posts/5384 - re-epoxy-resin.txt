Rod,

I've been using MAS throughout my build.
I started off with their Flag resin but then switched to Low viscosity on the recommendation of Geoff (NOLI).
I think the LV stuff is great, but of course the proof will be in the pudding.
I have no reason to doubt that it is not up to the job, and with full international sales and backup I expect it to perform every bit as well as West and System Three.
