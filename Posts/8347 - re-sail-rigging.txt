Ok draw this out on paper first, that's how I do it, my mind won't quite imagine it all. Fix the halyard end to the top of the mast, a small bracket might be good. Then run the rope down to a double block on the boom mounting. Run the rope up to a single pulley on or near the bracket you fix to the mast. Back down then to the other wheel on the haul yard block. Back up through the sheave you have in the mast top already. I'll try and take a picture of it today and post it here.
