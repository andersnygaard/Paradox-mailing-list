Thanks Alan,

I'm still exploring the Plymouth area while waiting to watch the start
of the Artemis Transat on Sunday, 11th May.

Al Law will be joining me on Monday, 12th in his Parado, 'Little Jim'
and we plan to sail in company towards the west, hoping eventually to
make it to the Scilly Islands.  The weather will determine whether
we'll be successfull, but the heart is there.  We want to be back in
Plymouth by 31st May to watch the start of the Jester Azores Challenge
race for boats between 20 and 30ft.

Cheeers,
Bill
