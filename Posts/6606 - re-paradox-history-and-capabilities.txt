Hi Nels,

I have to say the Bolger Micro has got to be my favorite looking boat in this whole category. I like everything about her. I chose the Paradox because I thought the build would better suit my needs. But I hope to someday sail in a Micro. Or at least see one up close. I also like the Black Skimmer but she was way way too big for me.

Thanx for the encouraging words. I believe the paradox was the right choice for me but I think it may not be the best boat for just anybody.

Rod

Hi Rod,

Let me suggest that there has never been - to my knowledge - any controversy over the design from any person who has actually built one, seen one, or sailed one. But a lot depends on where you plan to sail, how good a sailor you are and if you decide you want to go solo most of the time.

I think it actually fits into a fairly narrow "niche" in that regard and is why I was more drawn towards a Bolger Micro instead. It can easily take 4 (or more) people day sailing and since I am not a sailor first, I like the engine located on the center line to fire up at a moments notice. I also prefer a cat-yawl rig.

I would still love to build a Paradox just the same :-)
