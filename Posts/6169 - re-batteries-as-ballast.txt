Hi Al,
Are you sure your battery is only 12Kgs? Seems very light for 80AHr...
Cheers, Alan.

Well, I can't easily weigh it at the moment, but I must have done so when I installed it and I just replaced one of my lead bricks which weigh about 12kg (25lb).

Looking at the relative size of the solid lead and the battery it looks about right.

Hoping for calm nights
