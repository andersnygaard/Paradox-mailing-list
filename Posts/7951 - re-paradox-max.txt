Graeme,

I don't agree with you on that 40% increase in the height of the sail center of effort. The 40% is the increase in sail AREA, not in the vertical dimension, which is 20%. The COA will shift aft somewhat as well, but I can't calculate the exact distances without the sail dimensions. Also, I believe that the actual increase in COA height will be slightly less than 20% due to the shape of the sail.

Also, it appears that you were using 170% as the proportional increase in length and for the overall dimensional changes in the rig rather than the 120%.
