When I started in the trades, one of my mentors told me- "get the best tools you can afford, they're probably just barely good enough." 

The making and use of fine tool is not a new phenomenon.

 I have many tools that are made of fine tool steel, have fine rosewood and inlay handles, lots of brass, etc. I didn't pay a fortune for them. Rather, I accumulated them from estate and farm sales, traded for them, and was given some by older fellow carpenters who appreciated them and wanted the tools to be used to good effect by the next generation of craftsmen. Only rarely did I pay anything like list price for a new tool.

I had to be willing to strike at the opportunity as it arose, and not ruminate on whether the purchase was justified by my current work. I figured a fine tool at a good price would find appreciative hands and repay my purchase either by use or trade. Also, it might take a day's labor or more to derust, clean, sharpen, and tune a "new" find.

Some of these tools are from the Victorian age and have seen the hands of five generations of craftsmen or more. I don't think an inferior tool would have with stood the labors of this much hard work. They incidentally are sometimes worth a lot of money to collectors, but that's not why I own them. They simply make work more enjoyable, more accurate, and probably cost less in the long run.  Sometimes they work better than their newer counterparts. Planes designed for use on woods that contained lots of pitch comes to mind as an example.

And these tools give me a connection to the men who came before.
As I get older, I'm starting to think about who is going to use them next.
