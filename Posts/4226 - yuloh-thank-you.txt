Subject: Yuloh - thank you

Thanks guys,

I appreciate your responses regarding my Yuloh questions. I felt the more curved side of the blade should be underneath,(forward) so as to achieve lift like an aeroplane wing, but I was confused by poor photos which gave the impression the more curved side was uppermost.

Cheers,
Bill.
