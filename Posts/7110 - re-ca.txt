Subject: Re: CA?

It was worth checking out, but amazingly (to me, anyway), the centroid stayed in the same position horizontally when I heeled the hull (centered on the waterline) until the chine just touched the waterline (about 25 degrees). The centroid did, however, move down about 5 mm.

So that still leaves the same question: What does CA stand for?
