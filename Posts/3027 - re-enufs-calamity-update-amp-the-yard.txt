If it's a double cantilever then it's back to the Douglas Fir! Actually I'm not sure what a double cantilever is but a bamboo spar isn't going to be one and as Jack said will need lining up with the mast.

I have a piece of Fir that is long enough and 50 by 36 so it will be a little narrow at the widest point by a couple of millimetres. I enjoyed shaping the boom today using an electric plane for roughing out and then a number 5 bailey for finishing. It was very satisfying. I've still got to put the radii on but can't use my router table because the rotten hull is in the way.
  
Hull is cuddled up to a radiator in an effort to keep the temperature up in the workshop. It has been about 20 degrees all day but there was little direct sunshine today and rain is forecast for tomorrow. Oh hum. i think that I will go shopping in the morning. I find that buying things always relieves gloom :0)
