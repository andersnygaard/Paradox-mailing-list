Subject: Re: TILLER

Hello friends 

Thank you. 

The tiller is laminated and ready to begin sanding. I tell them that the mast intended to make aluminum, but when I started to look for prices that idea was very fast, I did enonce wood. There are new images www.derawson.com/fotos.htm 

Again thank you very much everyone for the help. 

Kind regards 

Alberto
