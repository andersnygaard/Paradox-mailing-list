Hi Jeff
 
I don't know what I need them for yet, just sourcing bits and pieces 
and that's what the plans say I need.
 
Does anyone have a view on copper nails?  I've acquired a potful of 
them, courtesy of the good ol' carboot sale, and it would be a shame 
not to use them if there's a suitable application.  Nelson had his 
ships built with copper rivets, so they can't be all that bad I 
suppose!
 
You do need about a dozen copper nails. There are ply doublers which 
are fixed to the deck and form the bottom of the forward end of the 
cabin, where the bottom of the front window fixes. Where there is no 
structure below the deck here copper nails are riveted through.
 
Hoping for calm nights
