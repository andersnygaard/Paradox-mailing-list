Subject: New guy question about interior finish
Date: Sat, 02 Feb 2008 19:02:22 -0000

I'm just starting to cut out the bulkheads for a Paradox, and I have some questions for the group about the interior finish. The options appear for an interior finish appear to be 1) Nothing, 2) Unthickened epoxy, 3) Varnish, 4) Paint.

Assuming I'm OK with applying any of the last 3, and I understand that I have to leave clear areas for filleting the bulkheads to the sides, does the group have opinions about which is best and/or the trade-offs of them?

Thanks in advance.
