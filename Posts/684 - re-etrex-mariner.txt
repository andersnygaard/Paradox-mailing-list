Great Post Dave, Thanks
Glen


Well, I got my Etrex Mariner GPS the other day and it works great.  
Thanks Glen for the recommendation.  However, I didn't want to spend 
$37 + tax for the cigarette lighter adaptor at West Marine so I 
started looking around the internet for an alternative.  It seems 
that the Etrex is a very popular GPS, but Garmin doesn't sell just 
the power/data cable.  Therefore quite a few people have been making 
their own plugs.  Some examples can be found at 
http://pfranc.com/projects/g45contr/emap/diy/index.htm .  For a more 
professionally made plug check out the ePlug which runs $7.50 apiece 
at http://pfranc.com/projects/g45contr/emap/index.htm .  For an 
adaptor you can get a 3 volt switching version for $12.98 at 
http://pfranc.com/cgi-bin/P/P3V .  All together, this comes out to 
$22.50 (including shipping) for a professional adaptor and a plug 
that you assemble.  For a preassembled adaptor it will run $25 at 
http://www.blue-hills-innovations.com .  Finally, if you just want 
an original Garmin adaptor it will cost you $29.94 including free 
shipping from Amazon.com. I think I've over reasearched this adaptor 
thing abit.  Still, it just kills me that a company makes a great 
product at a reasonable price and then tries to capitalize on all 
the accessories.  I guess that's why I never upgraded my old printer 
which I can still get cartridges that are refillable.   

Next I thought to myself, I don't want to input all my waypoints 
through the GPS so I went on the internet again to find a simple 
program to upload/download waypoints from my computer to the Etrex.  
Fortunately, this search was much quicker and I located a page that 
had what I needed at http://www.firstwaypoint.com/ .  The program I 
settled on was EasyGPS, which is shareware and is available at 
http://www.easygps.com/ . I found that it worked very nicely. 

The last thing I did was update my Etrex to the latest firmware at 
http://www.garmin.com/products/etrexVenture/download.html and then I 
reloaded the Marine data base (POI). In the end everything went  
smoothly.
