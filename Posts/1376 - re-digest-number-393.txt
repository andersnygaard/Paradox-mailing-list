I joined this group to learn about chine runners and see if they could be applied to other boats effectively. My main interest is in planing daysailers. I have no interest in cruising at this point. While I have found some interesting posts in this group, I am discouraged by the flaming and long diatribes. May I presume to make two suggestions to group members before I exit. These suggestions are only directed to those to whom they apply, of course.

1. Learn to snip out excess text from your replies. Two lines of new text in a response that is 3 pages long because of previous posts being included is a bit much.
2. Show respect to those with whom you choose to disagree within the venue. Limit your vitrol to personal emails if you must.

Good luck and favorable winds to all and remember:
"Mast up. Hull down."
Steve.
