Subject: Re: Fitting the Sail

Al your solution is interesting. I considered the same thing too. I was worried that all of the reinforcment patches would not be taking the strain in the way the sail designer intended. The sleeve had not any reinforcements. Based on long experience with designers in general I decided that The sailrite designer was conservative and that Matt Layden was very unique. So the sailright designer was the one I trusted more in this design conflict. It remains to be seen how it all works out. My new yard is a bit heavier than the original, and is no joy to raise. Especially at the last bit near the top. I also discovered that the hatch should be slid back a bit to allow the boom to lay itself down on the deck. I'm also wondering if there is any preffered direction for the rolling up on the boom? Clockwise or counterclockwise as viewed from the stern?

Hoping to launch in Manchester soon
