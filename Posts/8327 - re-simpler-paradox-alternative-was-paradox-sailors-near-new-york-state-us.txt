I would live to see a picture, sounds nice

Hi Brian et al...

For when my Paradox is too much boat, on small lakes without a ramp for example, I built myself a =C2=ABParaduck=C2=BB, which is a cross between a Puddle Duck Racer and a Paradox. Took me 4 to 6 weeks to build. Most of the advantages of the Paradox but a much simpler build.  It can be sailed from the inside like the Paradox when it rains and I can sleep in it very comfortably.  It is much slower than the Paradox, but who=E2=80=99s in a hurry?  Especially for exploring small lakes, I just love it.

This is my own design, based on the standard PD Racer hull.  8 feet long, 4 feet wide.  Reefable sprit sail.  Fits in a pickup truck or standard trailer.  I named it =C2=ABGorfnik=C2=BB, wanted a weird name which did not exist.

I=E2=80=99ll post a picture on the =C2=ABGorfnik=C2=BB album.  Let me know if you would like details of the build.  May be more suitable for the Microcruising group though.  Only kinda Paradox related.

Curwensville lake looks nice, maybe I should drive down with Gorfnik!

Have a nice day,
