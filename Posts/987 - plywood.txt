Hi all. 

I finally got a free day to drive to the candy store on a quest for plywood. I went with some Joubert Okoume BS-1088. Matt specifies that Douglas Fir marine plywood is fine, and I agree with him from the point of structural integrity. Doug Fir is good stuff. Going at a pile of old growth fir on a big planking job is really satisfying. However, I find the difficulties encountered when prepping and finishing (yes, even epoxied) Douglas Fir plywood to make quite an argument for Mahogany plywood, even with the substantial increase in price. Okoume marine ply is a pure joy to work.

I don't think that I would have run away from the Okoume BS-6566, as I think that it is also superior to Douglas Fir ply, though typically with less veneers than the BS-1088. The BS-6566 is a little cheaper than the BS-1088, but my supplier stocks only the latter. 

I'm using Honduras Mahogany lumber through most of the boat, and it's not really a matter of what's pretty; most of my boat will be painted rather than finished bright. It goes back to what is easiest to work and finish. 

I'm using West System epoxy because I trust it completely. I'm warming up to MAS epoxy, but frankly have little reason to betray a brand which has never given me cause.

Here is a condensed text of the BS-1088 standard. http://www.worldpanel.com/bs1088.htm

In the Pacific NW, these are a few good sources of exotic lumber and marine plywood. I get a lot of my materials at Emerson/Crosscut as they are a mere one hour drive away. http://www.emersonhardwood.com/cchw/default.asp http://www.edensaw.com/index.htm
