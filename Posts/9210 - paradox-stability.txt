I've just uploaded to the FILE section a righting diagram for a Paradox. I'm assuming that Matt Layden produced it, but am not sure.

The diagram shows that a Paradox will self-right to about 165 degrees. My question is whether any Paradox owners have actually suffered a knockdown/capsize/roll-over, and did their Paradox indeed self-right? I'm sure it makes a huge difference if the hatch is open or closed!!!
