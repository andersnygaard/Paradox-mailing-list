Cathy,

An old duckworks article featured a guy living (I think) in Germany and paddling the rivers there in a take-apart boat that doubled as a bookcase in his apartment.  I think what you need is a friend in the 'burbs with a yard!  Better still, one with space in his garage--just one off-season storing my boat in the yard left me with dead grass, and gully erosion come spring.
