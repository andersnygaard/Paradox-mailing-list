Subject: Staying Cool

All-

I am planning an extended trip ( As an Early Retirement present to myself) and am thinking of using my Paradox. 

I have everything worked out, except staying cool in the Sourthern US during the summer. I have had many sleepless nights on board sweating.

Any thoughts? Comments?

Thanks,

David
