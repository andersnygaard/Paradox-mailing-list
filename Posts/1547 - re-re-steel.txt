I am wondering how much care will have to be taken in the fabrication process to avoid stress once the hull has cooled. Will some of it have to be be preheated to stress relieve it during or after fabrication.

You never heat it too much at one time, you must tack it, move to another area tack it, and build up, plus the steel will not heat up and stress like thick plate welding does it dissapates the heat fast. Also, it is good to not grind the weld on the hull. On larger sailboats this wouldn't be as obvious, but sides could be one piece anyway as well as bottom so that does not matter.
