The curve this induces in the side panels will considerably stiffen them reducing the tendency to 'oil can'.

Yes, extend the cleats and, on assembly, fill the gap at the edge of the ply with epoxy. Then console yourself with the thought that epoxy is stronger than ply so the boat is actually stronger than if you hadn't made the mistake.

Little Jim is *much* stronger than the as-designed boat :-)
