Question 1
how far from the top of the mast does the halyard sheave fit.
I can't see any measurements on the drawings?

As far up as you can get it. 

I fitted a mast-head light a couple of inches high on top of my mast 
and had to slightly reduce the length of the wood so it would still 
fit inside the hull for travelling. I made the light sleeve over the 
top of the mast which allowed me to just cut a slot down from the top 
of the wood for the sheave to sit in.

Bill fitted his sheave a little down the mast and was never able to 
completely hoist his sail, a few inches was always still wrapped 
round the boom.
 
Question 2
How does one go about bending 12mm bronze rod for the tack strop?
That's seriously tough stuff. I've been informed to anneal it by
heating till cherry red then quench in water. Anyone been able to cold
bend it?
 

I used stainless, brute force, 2 people and a big hammer. One person 
heaving on the pipe, as Jack describes, and the other relieving their 
aggressive tendencies with the big hammer. The key seems to be a 
solid base for the fixed end. An ordinary bench vice just isn't man 
enough.

Take it slow and re-anneal if it seems to get even more difficult.
