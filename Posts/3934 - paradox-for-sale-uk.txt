Subject: Paradox for Sale UK

My Paradox Enuf is for sale.

I've been out twice at Poole and the energy expended sailing was greater than I imagined. I am a diabetic and I hypo'ed a couple of times. Very upsetting experience in a small boat, in the middle of the night, anchored just off the shore. I don't want to be checking my blood sugars every hour or two and nibbling biscuits and dextrose to adjust, or taking guesses with my insulin, so I've reluctantly decided to not sail.

Price: Boat and Mk2 sail =A3700 (includes 99 kilos of lead ballast, halyard, topping lift, steering line and rudder uphaul but not anchors, chain, warpage or electrical goods.

          Trailer absolutely as new, only been in fresh water four times (two launches and two retrieves) =A3500

You can see from this that I am making no attempt to recover my costs. I spent somewhere around =A3500 just on epoxy and glass fibre. I enjoyed the build, but if this can give somebody a quick entry into Paradoxing I'll be very happy.

If there are no takers, I'll be happy to negotiate a price for the sail and give the boat a Viking burial. The trailer will always come in for something.

If interested mail me with your phone number.

Thanks all.
