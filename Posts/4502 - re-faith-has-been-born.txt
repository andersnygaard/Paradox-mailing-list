When we are in the Falmouth area for our cruise to the Scilly Isles 
perhaps we should try to link up for a day or so with the DCA NW 
Holiday Meeting at St Just in Roseland which runs from the 7th to 
the 14th July.

Where would you launch at Falmouth? I also had wondered if we would 
coincide with the rally and had considered launching at St Just.

St Just is good, except there is a very steep, winding narrow road to 
the pebbly beach from which boats are launched.  I'll need to 
discover if my Mondeo is up to negotiating such an incline.  I favour 
St Just, but if it's going to be difficult I would use the slip at 
Loe-ven, between between Restrongate Point and Pill Point, north west 
of St Just on the other side of the River.  Trailers can be left 
there.
