Is this a world record?

Last weekend, under the auspices of a Dinghy Cruising Association rally a fleet of 3 Paradoxes gathered in Poole Harbour. The 3 boats were Faith, built by Bill Sergeant but now owned by Jim Hall, Johanna built by Pete Martin and Little Jim built by Alastair Law.

The sun shone, the wind was, if anything, a bit light and the company was stimulating. A great weekend.
