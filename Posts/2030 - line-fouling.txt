Subject: Line fouling

Hi All,

After doing all the Mod,s Matt recommended plus some, I spent a week doing sea trials down in Pirates Cove, Ala.

I am pleased with everything except one. The main sheet fouling problem, with my outboard the problem is compounded. The only solution I have come up with is to mount a sch 40 brass rod from port to starboard across the transom, a couple of inches off the deck, run the sheet out the transom as in the plans straight up through a fairlead on the bar and tie the end to the bar above where it's normally tied.

I believe this will keep the sheet out from the motor and the rudder. Any thoughts? Will this effect the sailing in any way? Might could build a place on the bar for the Yuloh and would make a great handhold.

Thanks,

David
