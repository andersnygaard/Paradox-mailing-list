Hi All,
I am starting the cabin parts. The corner post details says that the
for'd cornerpost angle is 30 degrees. I'm confused here. The angle
would be the asine of 100/245=24 degrees. What do I see wrong here?
Can you help? Sybe Starkenburg Montagu South Africa

The 30 degrees is on the cross section of the post, not it's angle to 
the vertical. It takes into account the angle between the side window 
and the front window.
