Subject: Re: Pipe Stowage rail

You've got the right idea David, but you want the hole to be about 3/4 inch and almost to the bottom of the backing block being careful not to drill thru the block, if you do, use some tape to cover the hole so the epoxy won't leak out. Now take your stowage rails and mark where they meet the deck when installed in the holes. Scuff this area very well with a course sand paper (60 grit) and take a rat tail file and scuff up the inside of the pipe. you can also drill a couple of small holes below the line. the idea being to give the glue some thing to get a firm grip on. Now clear coat the holes with straight epoxy a couple of times so the wood really soaks it up then mix up some 404 high density if you have it or else some cabosil to a thick but pourable consistency. Fill the holes to about 1/8 inch from the top and insert the rails tapping then a little so that the epoxy flows up inside and levels out as you go. Once they are all the way in you might want to add epoxy or clean up the over flow. To make the job easier to clean up I taped the area off before starting and drilled thru the tape (easier then taping around the hole). It's amazing how strong they are once the epoxy has set up.
