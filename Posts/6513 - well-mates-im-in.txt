Subject: Well mates, I'm in!

I've been pondering this decision for a while now. Trying to navigate where my heart and soul were guiding me. I'm in! The paradox is the boat for me.

Thanks to so many people in this group that have shared their wisdom and photo's. Without their historical accounts and proven success, I don't know if I would have been brave enough to dive in these waters. I've never built a boat before; although, I've dreamed about it since I was a teenager.

Well my wife has a degree in early childhood development, and she says I'm the poster child for a slow to warm up baby. That being said, don't expect me to finish the boat in under a year.

I do plan to share photos along the way. And I apologize in advance for some of the most basic and stupid questions that I surely will be posing to the group. And I hope Mr. Layden and the rest of you can forgive me if in the end I produce something that in no way resembles what a paradox is supposed to look like.

Respectfully,
