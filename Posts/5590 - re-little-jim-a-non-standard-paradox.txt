Subject: Re: Little Jim, a non-standard Paradox

Thats two different answers......which I appreciate.  Do we have any way of knowing which is right?  It seems that there needs to be a little clarification on the plans or something to guide us.  The yuloh can be a very important part of a boat and I feel it needs to be right.  The pictures that I've seen of the Enigma yuloh don't show it as being curved from one end to the other but rather only curved at the blade area.  I wish I knew which to do for sure.  Robb
