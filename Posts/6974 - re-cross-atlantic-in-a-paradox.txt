Yes... I believe she could... I have asked this question before and the general consensus is that paradox would make it but it would be totally un-fun. My girl would say "its a floating coffin... its too stuffy!" .. but then a cruise ship would be too "stuffy" for her. LOL

Subject: [paradoxbuilders] Cross Atlantic in a Paradox?


Hello,

Have been reading heaps of books and articles about crazy sailing adventures, such as serge testa circumnavigating in a 12 foot boat and some guy crossed the Atlantic on a hobie cat.

Just wondering about paradoxes sea worthiness.

What would happen to paradox in a storm at sea?

And do you think an ocean crossing is possible in a paradox?

What would need to be changed to paradox to make it more sea worthy? Fixed keel with heavy ballast? Would she just roll over in heavy conditions?

Been looking at 10 foot boats that have crossed oceans and they seem to be built the same way as paradox. Same thickness marine ply hull, stitch and glue etc.

Could the paradox do it?

Just a hypothetical :)
