Here is another option:

Someone is currently selling them (this link will go stale pretty
quickly):

and in the description says he has a few and will ship. I don't think
that would work as is for the Paradox, but it gets the gears turning
(literally and figuratively). Another idea I have is to build or buy a
hand crank 12V generator (the bare bones DIY is basically an old car
generator form the junk yard hooked up to a battery) and use a really
small trolling motor. I don't want a gas motor and I don't want a bank
of batteries, but I am not averse to a motor like solution.
