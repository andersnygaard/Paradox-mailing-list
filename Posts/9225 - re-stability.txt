Hi everyone great involvement in one thread
The rope isn't tied off mid ships , that should cause some turning moment
Any change in speed you can cause will turn the boat , and you right you have to be quick

I guy told me a story some months ago
I kinda believe it too
He was in search and rescue in tropical waters off Queensland
He said
Most who fall overboard are men
Most of them if ever found had alcohol in their system
They figure they go to the railing to pee while tipsy and fall over while the boat is on the move
Moments of distraction in a alcoholic haze
I done ever drink aboard a boat unless it's a cruise ship

More food for thought ?
