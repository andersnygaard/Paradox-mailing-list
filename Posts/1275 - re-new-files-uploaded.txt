Hi Glen.

You are partly right.

In the UK it is known as a GUSHER.

Hi All,

The other day the subject of Bilge pumps came up so I thought I would upload some pictures of the installation of "Zo=EB's" pump. When aboard Matt's "Paradox" I studied his installation and mine is pretty much a direct copy. I was incorrect the other day when I said he used a Whale Gusher, it was a Guzzler.

Tailwinds

Glen
