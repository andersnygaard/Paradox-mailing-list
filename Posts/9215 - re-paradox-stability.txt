Hi

No where near inverted but over 90 degrees , far enough over for the hatch to be scooping water in

The sail was underwater holding the boat in that pose but only while the wave was moving the boat , and all hull shapes will be pushed along by powerful rolling waves , the chine runners have little effect on that .

The forces involved mean mast bouyancy is negligible , it's the fact that the weight in the boat is held firm in the bilges

I asked the Adelaide University Engineering Department about where to place the ballast

Out board , not central to the hull was their firm answer

It seems to make no difference in my mind but I was thinking of it static , still , sitting in my shed

One the boat is rolling on the ocean ballast outboard is best according to the experts .

I'm happy that under all conditions that the boat will always roll up right after knockdown
