Wow Glen! Backing and filling a spinnaker aboard a racing multi can sure peg the pucker factor! I think that it is a defining point of a sailor's experience when he admits to another that "he's scaring the bejesus out of me". I can remember each time vividly...

Your story reminds me of another good point regarding strength. While everyone seems to be worried about the effects of an assault on the topsides with a pick axe, I always question the part of the boat above the sheer line. When extra weight is add to the hull, extra strain is borne on the rig and deck hardware. Honestly, I believe that this design can take such abuse as she seems already to be universally overbuilt (as designed). With light displacement boats though, this is a problem. Unfortunately, rather than lighten the load, often the rigging is just upsized.

Thanks for the great story. It's good to know that a regular guy can do a "Ronstan" move.
