Jim, thanks for the education on woven roving vs biaxial. Lots to learn.

That's how I am with all my project-- go in cold, and by the end I'm actually competent. The steep learning curve is a killer though in the mean time.

I guess I'll stick to the woven roving but I'll still have to give biaxial some serious thought. The extra cost of biaxial is not really important in the big picture.

PS: Yes, I meant to say "6 oz cloth" and not "matte". :-)
