Subject: Re: Calling all Paradox skippers: assessments? 

Thanks, Pete! 

I'd call 12 skippers a pretty respectable number for a home-built non-commercial design.  I am familiar with most of the separate websites you mention, but still think bringing a summary of their experiences together in one place would be useful to others considering building.  I think that's one point of having a group like this!

I know of one builder who found his Paradox didn't meet his needs and he no longer owns it.  This is of course likely more a reflection of a bad decision or changed circumstances than problems inherent in the design.  But this, too, can be instructive--a cautionary tale for the prospective builder.

In any event, Matt's designs stand very well on their own, and need no defense.  The stretched version I referred to is not Microcruiser (which is rather different from Paradox) but that described in the Files section--I don't know if any have been built.
