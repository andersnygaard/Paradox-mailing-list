Thanks Bill. Thats encouraging news about the reaching part. What did you need to get the Yuloh working ? Are the plans dimensions correct for you? Best, Steve 

I can reach the throttle when standing inside the cabin - a bit of a stretch though.
 Filling the tank can be done while in the cabin, but you cannot judge how much petrol is in the tank!  For this, you must be on the rear deck to look inside the tank.  I use a large funnel which I attach to the boat with a cord.  Al suggests I should get hold of a rubber bulb pump with tubes either side so that the fuel could be more easily transferred to the outboard tank; he also thought a fishing float could be used to ascertain how much petrol was in the tank.  These practical solutions would make the job of refilling the tank a safer and easier operation.
 For the sort of long distance motoring undertaken during my recent cruise of the UK South Coast, Al's solution to the re-fuelling problem would have been more satisfactory than me clambering on the stern deck, but for occasional use, I doubt one would need to expose oneself to the hazard.  At a third throttle the Honda will run for 2 hours at a speed of 3 knots - how often will you need to motor 6 nautical miles?  Mostly, the engine would be used for short periods of time, and therefore re-fuelling would not be a problem. 
I'll probably get around to making up the bulb pump system if I do another long cruise, but until then I'll not bother.  I'm only doing day sailing just now, and hardly ever need the engine - besides, I've got the yuloh working properly, at last ..... quieter, much nicer.
Cheers,
Bill.
