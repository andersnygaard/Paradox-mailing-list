Andrew,
I don't disagree, the Bolger boats handle fine as they are but somebody might want enhanced shallow water performance and a possible way of providing that would be to experiment with Chine Runners.  If the boats were build as designed and the Chine Runners were glued on (some experimentation with positioning and size required) then the boats could possibly be made to sail with their boards up in shallow water.  I would consider this a truly noble experiment.  Here is a sketch I found comparing Jessie Cooper with Paradox and Little Cruiser.


These boats are similar in design and the Chine Runners could be glued on for testing then ground back off if they didn't work.  They would not have to effect the operation of the boards on any of the designs.  If they were found add to much drag during normal operation then remove them and how much is lost.  Just a little time, labor, and material.

Sincerely,
Gene T.
