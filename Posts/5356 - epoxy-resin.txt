Subject: epoxy resin

Would like a little input here as I have watched the cardboard boat races and do not wish a duplication with my wooden boat!

I have used Mas low-viscosity 2:1 epoxy resin for my deck beams as it is readily available in most of the Marina stores.  I was thinking of using it for everything else but the water tanks. (system three) 

Has anybody had problems or heard of problems using this brand in the boat building community?

Thank-you,
Rod
