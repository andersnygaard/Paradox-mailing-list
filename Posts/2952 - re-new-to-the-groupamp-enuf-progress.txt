Subject: Re: new to the group.....&amp; Enuf progress

Fair do's Glenn; just an idea. I think I said at the time that it is your group so your rules apply and, as you say, his advice is accessible.

I spent yesterday preparing one side of Enuf for glassing. She is off the floor by about 10" on baulks of timber and I wanted to get the side more or less vertical rather than sloping inwards and away from me. I was about to cut 4' long wedges when I realised that nailing a couple of 2 by 2 stops to one end of the baulks to stop the boat sliding away and lifting the other side on a trolley jack did the job. 

Cheers  .....  Derek
