Subject: Re: Charcoal Stove

I've not overnighted in really cold conditions, minus 2 C is the coldest I have slept in and my sleeping bag kept me warm. However, getting up was another matter, but boiling a mug of coffee warmed up the cabin to quite a comfortable temperature and I was able to get dressed before the heat dissipated.

On the Paradox there is plenty of ventilation to provide oxygen to a single burner stove even with the hatch shut.

Hoping for calm nights
