Bill,

Nothing is wrong with you adapting the boat to your size. At the same time, there's nothing wrong with customizing the interior design, sail design, or propulsion system either. Building a boat is not about right and wrong, it's about what works for your purpose. Al and Bill have made some excellent points regarding the tried and true purposes behind Paradox design. Matt found what worked for him! If you plan to sail and live the way he did on your boat, then it would be wise to follow the plans as closely as possible.
