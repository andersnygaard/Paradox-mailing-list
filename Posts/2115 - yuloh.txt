Hi All, 

I'm having trouble understanding the drawing for the Yuloh, maybe you guys can help. The problem is with the statement... For'd lower side laminate with 30mm longitudinal curve concave downward. I assume this means there is a 30mm radius bent in it at the point described, like a golf club or hockey stick. How do you measure the 30mm curve? I have made templates with a 30mm radius but do not know where to start or stop the bend? Does anybody have any suggestions or, better yet, some close-up photos of that part of the Yuloh?

Thanks, 
David (Whisper)
