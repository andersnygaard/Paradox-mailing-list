The image of me by the trailer is pre modification and was good enough to transport the boat from shed to the boat builders yard
I had help laying two very thick layers of heavy double bias fibreglass cloth 
It has made the bottom of the boat extremely strong and very flat
I had the boat builder make a birds mouth mast too
His help was invaluable in getting things right , I'm not so good at reading plans as he is


Here is the modified trailer 
I paid A$800 for it originally and spent a few more dollars having it modified locally .

Hi , I modified a jet ski trailer
It works fine 
The boat sits level when towing and is well behaved behind the vehicle 
The rear most trailer beam is removable to allow launch in shallow waters
