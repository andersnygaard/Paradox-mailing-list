Thank you for your replies. Interesting to hear where each of your store your gear. Things end up in quite different spots depending what we've got. Clearly, I THINK I'm going to need much more gear than will turn out to be the case in practice.

Had a trial run with my self priming 12v diaphragm fresh water pump today. Very exciting (for me anyway) to see the water running in both directions depending on my valve settings.

Cheers,

Rob.
