Thanks, I had found the site for that boat, but didn't know about the video. In exploring the site I found the plans online too, but still don't understand how that furling system works. I'm not quite sure why the piece marked Filoire is used here?

I liked how he made the finger joints for scarfing plywood. Wish he showed how he made the jig for that.
