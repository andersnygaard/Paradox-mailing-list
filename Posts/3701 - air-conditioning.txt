Hi All,

I'm not sure if this is the right place for this, but here it goes. My company, Tecumseh products, has developed a small air conditioning system for golf carts, and I got to thinking, this would be great for small boats due to the plug and play, nothing extra needed, and small sizes.

I have volunteered Whisper for a test platform. It is very compact and runs on DC current (24 Volt). I will be using a generator and it's probably not suited for Paradox, but for larger boats, it might be the answer. I will keep you posted.
