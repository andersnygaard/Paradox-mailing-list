Subject: Re: Making mods after Bosunator Challenge

I'm gonna drill my sheet hole on the upper part of the transom, where you mounted the fairleads. What do you think of that? It will be interesting to see the mods you do with the sail.I plan on making one this winter and the window will definately be incorporated. Thanks, Andy
