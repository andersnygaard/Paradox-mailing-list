Well, at about 20 degrees of heel (where I think it sails best) the chine will be about 18 inches below water level, but remember that the rudder sticks down about 30 inches so that will hit the bottom first.

Of course if, when sailing like this in shallow water with the rudder partly raised, you should happen to hit the bottom with the chine runner, spilling the wind from the sail will immediately give you 9 inches clear under the hull. I have successfully manoeuvred down a channel on a broad reach in less than a foot of water.
