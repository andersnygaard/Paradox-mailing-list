Bolger designed a longer version of his Micro, by just adding 4 ft of length amidships on the same beam. (15.5 ft vs 19.5 ft.)

Since it is faster, it "seems" to have less leeway since the forward speed means there is less "time" for it to be driven downwind over any given distance.

Also the added displacement allows it carry considerably more sail than the Micro, adding even more speed potential.

It ended up that even Bolger was impressed!

Hi,

The simplest way to achieve your aim would be to simply spread out the bulkheads evenly. If you just want to extend the living area then just increase the spacing between bulkheads 2 to 3 and 3 to 4. The shape of the side panels could be found empirically during the trial assembly.

Whether this is a sensible thing to be doing and what it will do to the sailing ability is another matter.

Hoping for calm nights.
