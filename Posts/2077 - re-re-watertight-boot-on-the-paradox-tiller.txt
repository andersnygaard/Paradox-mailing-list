Subject: Re: Re watertight boot on the Paradox tiller

Robert, the USCG report to which you refer, has been hotly debated since its release (nearly twenty years ago), same as the reports which found saccarin to cause cancer, and Saddam to possess "weapons of mass destruction". The folks whom I have heard most fervently hold the series drogue in high regard have been sail makers, canvas workers, and those inexperienced sailors seeking a panacea for all vessels in every storm.

My real world experience has shown me that every boat requires its own particular techniques to withstand storm conditions. While the series drogue is an improvement on the drogues and streamed warps of yesteryear, they are not the panacea. They may be the best tool in one case, and a detriment to others. 

Contrast the series drogue with the lowly truck tire, upon which so many glowing reports have been written by experienced bluewater sailors. The truck tire is ugly, has zero presence in the glossy magazine advertisements, is available worldwide at incredible prices, can be utilized for other tasks like fendering and growing tomatoes, and can be discarded at little if any financial loss. Its hard to take seriously by anyone other than the boat crossing the Tasman Sea or the Indian Ocean.

I have already stated my beliefs as to why a series drogue would be a poor choice for the Paradox design, so I will not re-hash my points, except to say that I continue to firmly stand by them. I suspect that you are accustomed to concessions to your arguments, somewhat like an energetic 1st year law student. You can continue to beat this topic to death, but you can not ever win.

You are certainly free to take whatever cource of action that makes you comfortable. I hope that you will soon test your theories and let us all know how you fared.
