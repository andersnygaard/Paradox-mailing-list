All boats are a compromise, which have shortcomings and attributes. The trick is to find the combination which suits you and then learn to live with it and be content.

My view is that a 20 per cent enlarged Paradox would be a mixed blessing. You'd need a bigger car to pull it as it would weigh a lot more and be a little more difficult to launch and recover onto the trailer. The slight enlargement would still have the same problems when living on board as the existing Paradox. For me, the main annoying factor is that there is not enough room to leave my bed permanently rigged.   

What would really be interesting is a doubling of the size If length, breadth and depth were doubled, internal volume  would be 8 times what it is now. What a  live aboard cruiser that would make. 

The rig would have to be revised as the sail would be too big for easy handling as it is. Maybe junk rig would work best?
