Congratulations on the chine logs, Rob!

I fitted my bilge dividers in before putting on bottom. much easier and more precise this way. I checked mine with a straight bar crosswise over chine logs, so everithing else between those are lower.

Bottom - I marked a centerline on the bottom, also on each bulkhead; and drifitted first. then drilled 2 holes through bottom for dowels in centermost bulkhead; and when final assembling, glue smeared on - putting the bottom on dowels first, on man holding in each end of the bottom. When catching the dowel holes in the bottom, it was already in place, no glue was where it was not supposed to be. Then worked with fastening towards both ends. In my Thu album there are also some photos on it.

Cheers,
Eerik
