I can tell you that the Paradox doesn't have to be heeled over a lot to gain leeway resistance.

When sailing nearly level in light winds it does pretty well for leeway.  Something to do with the deep rudder and general hull shape acting as a keel.

But does need some way kept on for tacking  ability. If yoou get in irons it can be a sod to get going again.............

Best
