Subject: Re: Yard Part Build for Paradox

I converted mine to aluminium 3 years ago. After changing to the new type sail, the old wooden one was just too short for the new sail, so I was forced into doing something. I had the tubing to hand and thought it would be easier to use that than to make a new one from wood.

I reckon the aluminium tube is slightly stiffer that the old wooden yard, which increases the draught of the sail at the top slightly, although it's now taking a slight set which offsets this a bit.

I'm very happy with the outcome.
Best,
Jim

Subject: [paradoxbuilders] Yard Part Build for Paradox

Hello Sailors,

I was wondering about the different types of material you may have used to build the yard. The wood of choice is DF correct? I thought others decided on a denser wood and commented that the denser wood made the yard heavy; others have used aluminum? -- or at least experimented with aluminum.

Have most builders used DF for the yard?

I am now shopping for a good lumber place for wood materials on in the NE area of U.S.

Fair winds,
Deric
