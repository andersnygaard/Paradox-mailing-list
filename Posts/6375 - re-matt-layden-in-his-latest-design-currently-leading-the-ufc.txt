Nels,
It looks like Matt will have a good West wind until Sun. night and sometimes strong. Notice that his course will be as far to the lee (East) of land or rather foliage that will mess up his wind. The paddle boats will hug the foliage unless the wind gets behind them. This wind will help him a lot and not hurt the kayakers much.
The strong gusts between the foliage will knock him down but he is use to that by now. It is a tender little boat. but inherently safe.

Unbelievably Matt aka Wizard is keeping ahead of two very experienced Kayak paddlers, in his tiny 9 ft. Illusion, in the around Florida challenge.

His is traveling inside the ICW so not getting much wind. Latest update this morning posted by his wife I think.

One comment was that Enigma looks big compared to Illusion and you don't climb into Illusion as much as pull it on:-)
