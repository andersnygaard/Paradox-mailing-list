Subject: Further adventures of Little Jim

I am intending, weather permitting, to take my Paradox, Little Jim, out for our first long distance cruise this weekend. Actually it is not a very long distance, but it is much further than we have been before. The intention is to take 4 days and sail from Poole Harbour to Portland Harbour and back, a distance of 27 miles each way.

I shall launch on Saturday into Poole Harbour, sail to Portland on Sunday, return on Monday and lift out on Tuesday. I have taken wednesday off work as well, so I can stretch the timescale if necessary. If we get stuck somewhere on the way I can easily get a taxi back to Poole to pick up the trailer.

Mind you, with the weather as forecast at the moment I may never get to Portland as it looks as if the wind will be on the nose. There will be rain as well, but I haven't had a chance to try out the indoor sailing yet, so I won't let that put me off.

I have chosen Portland as my destination as there is no significant tidal window to get into the harbour, a significant factor as I don't have much of an idea of what sort of speed we can expect to average on open water.

I'll report in again if there is a change of plan before the weekend.

Hoping for calm nights
