May I ask...

Why do you want to do this?

Is it because you dont want to drink nasty tank water...

or is it because you are afraid the tank may leak and/or contaminate your whole water supply?

take care

Rod,

The bags sound good but would be no guarantee that water bag leakage 
or water coming in the hatch would not get into the void around the 
bag. This would need to be dried out regularly.

Sincerely,
Gene T.

I plan on building my paradox design exactly as per plan. Useing Xxx

for a back-up system, but I was wondering if before I put the tops on,
I could insert a custom made RV plastic(whatever they use) fresh water
tank in each area. I have seen some small Rv's with several small 
water
tanks place through-out and was wondering if anyone has tried this. I
think they can be custom ordered inexpensivly. Or what about Fresh
water bladder bags as some boats use in hulls... has someone
experimented or tried these for a Paradox? If I place them in that
same location as original plans and make epoxy tanks as well per plan
then if I get a leak in the Rv tank or bladder bag all is contained
within original tanks. Would like Pros and cons feed back on this.

Thanks,
Rod
