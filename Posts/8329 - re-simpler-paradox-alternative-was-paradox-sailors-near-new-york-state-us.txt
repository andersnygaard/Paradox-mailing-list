Hello,

I'm interested in more information and pictures of your ParaDuck boat. I did buy plans for Ocean Explorer which is similar to a Puddle Duck with a cabin but the sail-from-inside feature is not included with that little boat.

Could you give me (us) a little more details? Side Height, Cabin Height and Length, and a few other details like the controls for sail and rudder. More pictures would be great.

Thank you,

Brian
