It’s been a while since I’ve posted anything, but I recently found this whilst researching single-burner gimbal stoves. I was fortunate enough to get one of the last Forespar Mini Galley stoves before production was ceased, but I’m inclined to build one of these Jetboil gimbals anyway for a portable solution that could easily serve dinghies, transoceanic voyagers, and campervans alike.
