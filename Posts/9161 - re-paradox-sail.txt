Hi Steve, 

I met with Quantum Sails located in Rochester NY and spoke with the owner Kris Werner. They are about to make my sail, which is the original design.

Although, I would have enjoyed the learning and challenge of making the sail, I realized that I have too much boat work with many boats to take on the sail project. I asked them to make the sail with 6 ounce cloth. 

Will post pictures and comments after I receive the sail. Looking to finally get to sail the paradox after purchasing her form Wanda and Josh Elliott – was Don Elliott's Paradox.

Fair winds,
Deric
