I posted to Paul's Pictures in the file section, a picture of a NACA 
0006 airfoil superimposed over Matt's foil shape from the plans. A 
NACA 0008 is not even close.

Just in case you think I know what I'm talking about, I haven't a 
clue. I just read about airfoil shapes in Don's building manual, 
looked up airfoil shapes, and picked one that looked close.

If the scan of Matt's foil shape from the plans violates copyright, 
let me know and I'll remove the file.
