Try cutting your cloth on the bias (45 Degree), that should help it lay down. I have been meaning to write up a blurb on how I did it but to be honest I'm having a hard time recalling just how I did it. As I recall I made a mold of the inside shape and began laying up the glass, once done I filled the casting with high density mixture and then bored the hole with my drill press. If you have Elliott's article he lays it up over a dowel rod. It is worth a look if you have it, by the time I did mine I didn't think to check how he had done it so just figured it out on my own. Anyway, I think if you cut the roving on the bias you will get on ok, let me know how it goes.

Any advice on putting it on ? The first layer didn't want to bend and stick to well, thought about using push pins, any thoughts ?

That's correct David, it's a very heavy casting.

Hi All,
Just got through casting the lower rudder gudgeon and wanted to confirm the 6 layers of 24 oz roving (epoxy on the print)thats between 1/4 and a 1/2 in of roving. Is that correct? Seems excessive to me.
Thanks
David
