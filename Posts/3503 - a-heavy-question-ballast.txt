Subject: A heavy question-ballast.

Hi,

I'm wondering about ballast and how this has worked-out for others. Obviously for such a small boat, the final trim will vary with placement of stores etc, but does the ballast as designed work-out to be about the right position? I am asking because I want to have an electric outboard and have recently sourced some sealed lead-acid batteries ex a telecomms company which uses them for backup power. They constantly change them way before they even begin to deteriorate and so I have got some 'for a song'.(Riding along on the crest of a wave and the sun is in the sky, la la la...)

I need to decide where to mount them as they are also going to be the ballast, at about 70-90Kgs. It seems to me that the best place should be along the centre-line, but the plans show the lead out towards the sides. I don't understand this as it means that 1/2 the ballast is then outboard of the centre of bouyancy when the boat heels and won't be helping to right the hull? Anyone got any comments on this?

I also don't want the built-in water-tanks, but will have a somewhat smaller amount in shallow plastic tanks, which will also contribute to the ballast.

Thanks,
Alan.
