I am going to (soon) begin purchasing materials

Is there a brand of Epoxy that I should avoid?

I am going with either West System, or System-3 unless I get advice to the contrary. Assuming my build will last from winter into summer, or with a late start, summer into winter... is there a suggested go/no-go brand or any other advice?
