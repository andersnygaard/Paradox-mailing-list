I agree. They are an irritation, but the delete key deals with them quite easily.

On other groups that I read as a digest they are, if anything, more of a nuisance as, if you want to keep one post you have to keep the trash as well.

I would not favor having to go to yahoo to read paradox builders. The included advert stuff in the emails is bad enough, let alone every 3rd page fetch being an advert on yahoo itself.
