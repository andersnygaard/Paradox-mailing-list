Subject: More progress & questions

Today I've nearly finished the boom and the mast. Aah, I do feel good :0)

I'm almost decided to use a strop and sheave for the halyard pulley and haven't cut a slot in the mast.

I haven't got a yard yet but do have a goodly length of 35mm bamboo, as mentioned before. If I reinforce at the point it bears against the mast with glassfibre tape wrapped around the bamboo it is it likely to do the job? Do I really need the cantilevered, and heavy, yard as specified by the plans?

Thanks for any help/advice ....... Derek
