If you make the deck beams by laminating them in plywood, due to the fact that half the thickness of the ply has the grain going across its width, would not this weaken the beam so needing it to be made deeper with more laminations to compensate for this just to give it the same strength as if all the grain went the length of the beam.

On NOLI I just cut out the beam profile in 3/8" marine ply and a piece of 3/4" deal (spruce) and glued and screwed them side by side. The ply was strong enough to take my weight just on its own. The deal was there only to stop the ply from flexing and to give a bearing surface for the ply deck.
