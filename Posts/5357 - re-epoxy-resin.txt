Rod - I built my Paradox entirely using System Three. For price, ease 
of mixing, and customer service I think it is hard to beat. As you are 
in Southern California you might also take a look at Aircraft Spruce 
based in Corona. They sell a wide range of structural epoxies and 
accessories, some perfectly suited for boatbuilding. They also sell 
System Three.
