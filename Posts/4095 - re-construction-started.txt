Bill,

Your boat is coming on really well. It's going to be quite stunning when finished. It's great to have all these photos as it makes it a lot easier to make sense of some of the more difficult parts of the plans.

I marked out my gash chipboard stock today with the lines for the Cabin beams, and also a template for the tiller.

I can't find anywhere where the length of the cabin beams is stated. I've made the jig 800mm long, I expect the beams are cut to fit after cabin frame is installed (that will be a long way off!)

The tiller I had to extrapolate from sheet #4 and #11 as there doesn't seem to be anywhere that gives the offsets. I hope it works out OK.

Pete


You can measure the length of the deck beams from the lines drawing (Sheet 2); add 3 or 4 inches and you should be OK.

I did the same thing for my tiller, but I did not put enough curve into it, which meant a very close shave to miss the baffle and last deck beam. I had to make the last deck beam thinner to accommodate my mistake, but it worked out fine in the end.

Bill.
