The simplest way to achieve your aim would be to simply spread out the bulkheads evenly. If you just want to extend the living area then just increase the spacing between bulkheads 2 to 3 and 3 to 4. The shape of the side panels could be found empirically during the trial assembly.

Whether this is a sensible thing to be doing and what it will do to 
the sailing ability is another matter.
