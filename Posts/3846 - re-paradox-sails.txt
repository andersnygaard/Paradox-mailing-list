Thanks for the clarification. I'm not sure why you consider the sail moving forward to not be a problem. Is there a trick you use to furl the sail? I keep thinking of that watertribe video of Matt's roller blind demo making it look so easy. Wouldn't that be a problem if the sail started wrapping around the reel? or are you talking about a subtler movement?

I am not sure how much the Mk 2 sail moves forward (I have a Mk 1) but I think Derek mentioned a figure of 2.5 inches. The boom is plenty long enough to position the sail so that when furled it is still clear of the reel. Once set up the operation is quite repeatable, so if it is clear once it will be ok thereafter.

Furling the sail is as easy as it looked, except for the blisters from the ropes till your hands get hardened.

Hoping for calm nights
