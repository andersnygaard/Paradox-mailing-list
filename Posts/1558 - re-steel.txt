When I first launched my Paradox it was a couple of trips before I got the handling right (positive tacking, straight tracking etc). Before launching the boat I had weighed it and then added lead to bring it up to the design displacement of 640kg. Shifting this lead about had a significant effect on the handling and allowed me to get it just right.

If you only want to go on short trips then the ballast would probably remain unchanged, but in theory for every pound of stores you add you should remove a pound of lead.

It probably doesn't affect most of us, but if you want to go off on those 3 month Bahamas trips then it should certainly be considered.

In practice I have not changed my ballast so far and have seen no ill effects. My longest trip was 6 days, but I didn't carry food for the whole trip.

I have not received the plans yet, so I cannot reference them accurately. However, is all the lead removed to go out on short trips? If so, I understand your point, but if it still has to have ballast, then some of that ballast can be incorporated into the hull, as long as trim and CG remain where they are supposed to be.
