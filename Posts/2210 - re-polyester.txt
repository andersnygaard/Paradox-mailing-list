Subject: Re: polyester?

Hi folks! My Paradox now looks like a boat in its first stage of dry run. It=B4s a lot of sealing surfaces with epoxy in the instructions. What about polyester? Costs 1/4 of epoxy. Does polyester and epoxy work together? For instance, in layers on the bottom. Has anyone tried? I=B4d be grateful for any aspect on the matter.  Bengt

Polyester is not an adhesive so it will never stick to other surfaces as well as epoxy.  You can use epoxy for repairs but not polyester.  You *can* use polyester for original construction, but the results won't be as strong or as good or last as long.
