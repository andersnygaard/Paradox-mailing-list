Hi Guys,

Sorry to tie up the forum with questions to Glen, But I need his advice on the boat I bought. He has seen her.

Glen, In your opinion how well do you think this boat was built? The more I sail her, the more I want to Fix her up like "Zoe". Do you think it would be worth the effort? I dont want to do it if shes going to fall apart a few years down the road. With my limited experience Im having trouble making this decision.

Thanks 

David Beard
