I am not sure how much the Mk 2 sail moves forward (I have a Mk 1) but I think Derek mentioned a figure of 2.5 inches. 

Oops, typo! It is actually 7.5". The Mk 1 sail has a 90 degree angle (anybody know how to raise the degree symbol on a Mac?) between foot and luff. The Mk2 has a greater angle and so the luff moves forward along the boom as the sail furls.

Just been making my new boom out of the Mahogany left over. Posh, or what?
