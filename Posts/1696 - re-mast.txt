Subject: Re: Mast

Yes,

Some dimensions, type of wood, etc, simple, elaborate.. whats the norm for what works... for this type, since its winter, spending some time on it wouldnt really matter, hexagon taper?? octgon? round?? masts not being my forte, very curious, and its not pressing as ive tons of other considerations. also before building I am looking at scaling to a larger hull, and looking for data, the mast is part of that and as the boat grows so does its masts requirements. looking for some insight.
thanks

Jack
