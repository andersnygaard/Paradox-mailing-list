If your ballast is going to cost real money anyway, why not spend it on something heavy with another purpose? The first thing that springs to my mind is a dismantleable storm anchor, such as the Luke that Little Cruiser carries. The second is a nice beefy battery.

I have recently weighed little Jim and as a result am now down to about 36kg (75 lb) of lead. The bicycle was the last big thing I added. I will soon have to start thinking twice before adding more gear if this goes on.

Hoping for calm nights
