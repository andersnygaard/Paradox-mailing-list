Subject: Re: Rubbing Strake

Little Jim has a green rubbing strake about 0.5m deep down each side 
:->

I started with a string of 4 fenders which I tied from bow to stern, but it was too much of a fiddle. I then changes a couple of the carriage bolts holding the hatch rail for eye bolts. That works quite well. This summer I discovered that you need bigger fenders when you want to come alongside another Paradox, or the chine runners can still hit.

Mostly I don't come alongside things.

I didn't even go that far. I got my ply from Clarkswood (www.clarkswood.com). It was called 'Far Eastern Marine Ply' and wasn't too bad. I got all the timber from Robbins, and was happy with the quality.

I got some from them, but bought the bulk from SP Systems on the Isle of Wight. It all worked ok.

Hoping for calm nights
