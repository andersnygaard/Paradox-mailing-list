Clarification on the boat types. Pelican is aboard a Hobie tri design with mirage drive. So that explains his 6 knot speed at one point.

He fell behind early on when he rescued I believe, a Wayfarer crew that capsized. And had some ama damage during the rescue. Then lost more time when the winds became more contrary than experienced by the other challengers who were well ahead when that happened. I understand he has wheels for it and a bicycle aboard!
