Subject: Sail balance

Hi All,

When sailing Whisper, I'm having to use negative rudder to hold her on course. The amount of negative rudder depends on which point of sail I'm on. My question is, is this normal? If not, is it because the sail is not balanced? And how do I balance it? There's not any room on the spars to move the sail forward or aft. Or could it be a ballast issue? Any comments or suggestions?

Still Learning,
David
