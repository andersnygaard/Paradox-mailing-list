Subject: Re: Yrvind updates his build

Yrvind has a beautiful looking boat - a sort of 'top of the line' Paradox...sigh, as my wood working skills are limited hopefully one day I can purchase something like it or a paradox...

Till then, I drool...

PS can't wait for his sea trials and comments on the chine runners...

Subject: [paradoxbuilders] Yrvind updates his build

I just noticed that Yrvind has updated his site build record.
I have wished that he had an archive to see the past updates. 
http://www.yrvind. com/present_ project.html
A very interesting first rate build. Some of us would love to have 
those facilities and expertise.
