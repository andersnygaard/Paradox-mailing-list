Should have mentioned that he reviews the stuff so he gets a deal. Perhaps the biggest plus would be none of the BS associated with ethanol in gasoline. This is a real problem particularly on small engines with miniscule carb clearances. I've had bad gasoline, but never have I heard of bad propane. From an economic standpoint, you are correct, not competitive.

Thanks for the link. But that review is so full of holes it's inspired me to write up my own blog entry on LPG vs Gasoline. I'm in the market and just blew past these LPG outboards as just the latest suckers bet:) His only valid point is they are slightly cleaner, but he ignores the economics completely. I've traveled thousands of mile with gasoline and have a very different opinion than his. But then he spent the money now needs to justify the choice I suppose:)

A friend uses one on his WW Potter and likes it. His review:
