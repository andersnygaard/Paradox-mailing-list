Subject: Re: re plywood

I wonder if Bill Sergeant would jump come in here with his thoughts? He is building a 
Paradox and previously built a 50/50 canoe without, I think, epoxying everything.

As Neil says there are differences of opinion on the use of epoxy with ply.
I have been very liberal with it but by buying in smaller quantities at a time I have been 
paying about =A350 a gallon. If I had realised how much that I would use I would have 
bought the 8 gallon packs from my favourite supplier at =A334 a gallon. 
Now that I'm at the end of the build I have no idea how much epoxy that I have used. I 
realised awhile ago that  this was getting to be expensive and stopped keeping a record. I 
bandy around a figure of =A32500, but in truth I have no idea. Do I count trailer, radio, gps, 
fishfinder, outboard, things bought in error or on a whim and thrown into the spares box? 
There is at least =A31600 there and I doubt that I have done the rest on =A3900. Then there is 
a lot of books, many bought second hand, on top of that.
My next build will have to be on a budget because I expect to be retired. What ever I build 
I will use exterior ply and pine because I can rescue it very cheaply from building sites and 
skips. I will thoroughly epoxy all ply edges, any endgrain and anywhere that water may 
gather such as bilges. The rest I will paint using household paints. I am experimenting in a 
few areas of Enuf with Dulux Weathershield.
Like me, the boat won't last forever but it is unlikely to become dangerously decayed in 
the time that I am using it. I hope :0)
I would guess that if you are building for posterity wood isn't a good material.
