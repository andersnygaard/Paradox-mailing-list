Andy,

Three of the best books that I own on boat construction are by the great English amateur boatman Percy Blandford. They are:

1. Practical Boatman
2. Build Your Own Boat
3. Modern Sailmaking

Blandford was a man of many talents and wrote innumerable books on many hobby related subjects, most notably canoe/kayaking. He always found the least expensive way of doing things and they were always so darned clever. He was the quintessential English amateur.

I encourage anyone who is interested in these books to do a search on www.abe.com or www.alibris.com. Written between the late 1940s and 1970s, they are wonderful glimpses into the past of early amateur plywood boat construction, but highly relevant for Paradox builders. Loads of helpful illustrations, too.
