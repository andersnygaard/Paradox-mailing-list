It seems that would work if you can raise the mast high enough by hand to allow the forestay to get enough leverage to help with the raising. Otherwise, you'll need a strut that is vertical when the mast is horizontal to help with the vectors. That's the way larger masts are done.

Why not just build a lighter mast that you can lift? Birdsmouth hollow construction, maybe? Seems simpler.
