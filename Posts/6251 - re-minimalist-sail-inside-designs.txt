Subject: Re: Minimalist sail-inside designs

Water ballast is one obvious solution.  I recall reading somewhere that Sand Flea has water ballast tanks on the sides.  Looking at images of Sand Flea, it's pretty clear that there is no room to shift operator weight from side to side while sailing.

I do wish Matt would put out plans to this little gem.
