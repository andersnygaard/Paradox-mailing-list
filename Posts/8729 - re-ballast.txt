Stephen, sorry about the funcky autocorrect and my not proofreading. My point,which I think you saw, was the balance problem. Your point is well taken that the sail shape could be tweeked or an aft leaning sheeting spar could be used.

The sheets are way back on junkrigs yes. Writing is rewriting and rigging is rerigging, I suppose. Sailing will always be a work in progress. Maybe the sail is enlarges as it gets higher. The boom being shorter than the yard. Is this ridiculous? But it may solve the sheet/aft rigging issue. Jack I don't know what you mean when you refered to 'red' and 'reds.'

In a traditional junk rig the sheets lead aft so as to be clear of the sail and the ends of the ribs. I'm not sure how you would do that on paradox with the. Red to have the sail as far aft as it. Reds to be for balance.
