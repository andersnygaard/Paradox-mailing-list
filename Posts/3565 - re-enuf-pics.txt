HI

The group name should be changed to the PARADOX DOSSERS judging by the latest postings,it makes me feel at home.I once climbed over a park gate to doss for the night,tent up,discovered in the morning i was in a very posh front lawn.The bloke was a bit irate at first but we got a breakfast and a shower.I have a feeling that matt is a no.1 dosser

regards
martin
