Subject: More build questions

Ok, I've made the bulkheads and made a start on the mast and rudder. The hull panels are cutout but I'm thinking of joining them with a butt join on the inside and the payson method on the outside. This will add an extra 110mm to the length.

Will this change the sailing performance of the final boat?

Should I cut 110mm from one hull panel so it's the same as the original length?
