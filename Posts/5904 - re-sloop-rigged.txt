The reason it is not sloop rigged is because it is difficult to do everything from sitting inside. You can't easily climb out to furl or reef and fly a jib. It is possible but will not perform nearly as nice as Matt Laydens recommended rig.

Hi,

Newbie here, so please be gentle!

Been sailing on and off for 26 years, and looking for a cheap, portable pocket cruiser for weekend sailing in the Lakes etc.

Having looked at Andersons, and Seawytchs, I stumbled across the Paradox whilst looking into sail canoes.

I very much like the look of this craft, and not averse to putting in the hours to build one. 

And here's the question.

I've done a search through here for sloop rigged Paradox's, found lots of discussions, but no conclusive statements as to whether the basic design can be modified to run a sloop rig.

So, can anyone help?

Many thanks,

Matt
