Subject: Re: Cabin Top forward beam.

Thanks to all who have responded. I think I need to spend more time in my thinking chair looking at the problem! 
So far I've fitted the temporary side panels and ply laminations fore and aft. If the weather warms up a bit by the weekend I'll try and jig up the front end with some stiff card or hardboard and see if I can make sense of all the suggestions. I'm sure it's not that difficult.
I had considered an all ply construction (the rear part is ply anyway because I'm fitting washboards) but want to try and keep it as close to the plans as possible. My mock up looked quite reasonable so I'll progress along those lines.

Many thanks again.
