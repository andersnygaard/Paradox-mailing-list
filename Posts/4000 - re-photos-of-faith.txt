Subject: Re: Photos of 'Faith'

Thanks Steve. There are a number of things not quite as well finished as I would have liked, but on the whole I'm satisfied with how she is shaping up.

How are you doing with your boat? Are you at a more advanced stage towards finishing?

As promised, the latest photographs showing the progress I am making with building Faith, are now available at:

Since they were taken I've fitted the number 2 deck beam, and the backing blocks for the forward and aft mooring cleats.
Bill.
