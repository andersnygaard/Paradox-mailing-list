Thanks for all the info Al. I know you're off sailing this weekend 
and what a scorcher it's been. I discovered that my new boat shed was 
too hot to work in! I had to open the doors wide to let in some fresh 
air.

I first thought that my cardboard bulkheads looked really small, but 
when I actually set them out in their correct positions and joined 
them all together the boat really came to life.

I'm happy now that I'll have enough space to work in when the 
weather's not so good. I've ordered my ply so hopefully the next 
report will be of more "real life" building.

I hope to order some epoxy tomorrow, I'm still trying to decide 
between West and MAS. 

Pete.
