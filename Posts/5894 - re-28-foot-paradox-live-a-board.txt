Subject: Re: 28 FOOT PARADOX LIVE A BOARD

Hello Chaps

Sorry for the delay in replying, as I said in my initial post, I was living in a van in an old yard miles from anywhere and virtually now contact with technology.

I am now getting on very well and have actually sold my van to raise cash and am living under some insulated canvas on my half finished boat, the weather is not making thing very easy, lets all hope it picks up soon.

The boat building is going very well, and I promise to answer some of your questions soon, when I get my new laptop, and Hopefully a digital camera.

Thanks for all the kind messages of support and useful information is has kept me going through all the snow and frost.

Hope all your projects are going as well as my 28 foot paradox is.

Kind Regards - David.
