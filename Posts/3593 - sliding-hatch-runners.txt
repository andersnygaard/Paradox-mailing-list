Hi all,

Since building Little Jim I have never been very happy with the way the hatch has slid open and closed. Following the advice of someone on (I think) the uk.rec.waterways newsgroup I have just fitted new running surfaces. These were made from formica strip intended for edging kitchen work-tops. 

First impressions are that it has solved all the sticking problems. Whether it will be durable, only time will tell.

Hoping for calm nights
