Subject: Re: Regarding some of the mechanics of living and working on board a Paradox

Al has answered your questions as I would have answered them except I kept my bower anchor in a frame on the starboard side near the entrance to the forepeak.  My kedge anchor was kept in the loo bucket along with its chain and warp. I tied the bucket to the shaft of the bower anchor so that the kedge anchor was ready for immediate deployment.

One of the secrets for comfortable living aboard a Paradox is to have a good quality self-inflating mattress.  This does not need to be a full length one, and is best if it only takes up about 2 thirds of the width of the cabin.  This means you can easily get at thing in the floor lockers if need be.

I made a removable table that fitted across the cabin supported on the side bins and I found it useful for having the odd banquet and for my laptop computer.

I cruised 'Faith' for over 2 months along the South Coast of England and I found her very comfortable.

Paradox is not suitable for overweight large people or for those who cannot kneel or bend.  Getting into the forepeak requires Houdini characteristics, especially if one wants to extract the battery!  I would recommend doing what Al has done, and that's to eliminate the raised edge of bulkhead 2. You could also reduce the height of the central division in the forepeak or do away with it altogether.  Derek Clark with his 'Enuf' made the width of the entrance to the forepeak wider than shown on the plan by eliminating most of the starboard support.
