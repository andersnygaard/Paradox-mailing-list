Good thought, Al.

A PDRacer (or better, a PDGoose) hull with a Sand Flea deck and an Enigma 360-type canvas cover should be a very straightforward build.

If the deck detaches from the hull with bolts and the deck splits into two or more pieces so that it fits inside the car, it would be car-toppable.

If you don't need to car-top, a PDGoose hull with a Paradox solid cabin in the rear would also be a straightforward build.
