Subject: Re: Vent Trunk

Pete,

I have a removable side panel with no gasket and have no trouble with leakage, (only the top half is removable). The block is mounted on the removable panel and all lines can be accessed thu the vent hole on deck.

I like to have access to the inside for inspection and painting.

Hope this helps

David

I've completed my vent trunk, apart form the starboard side panel.
I have a few questions.
Have those who left the panel removable had any trouble with leakage?
Have you fitted some sort of rubber gasket?
Have you mounted the halyard turn around block to the removable panel?
Do you actually ever need access again, or can halyard, furling line etc. be deployed through the vent opening.

TIA
