Hi Deric,

I live in Massachusetts and just get Douglas Fir from the local lumber yard.
I would think you should be able to find it at your local lumber yard. (Not a Home Depot.)
They let me inspect and select the boards.
If you can go take a look at your local lumber yard and see what the quality is like.
e.g. My local lumber yard, listed under lumber.

(I also get WRC (Western Red Cedar) from them. Less stiff, soft, but half the weight.)

For marine ply and sitka spruce I go to Boulter Plywood in Somerville MA.
They have DF too, but that you should be able to find local.
I see they deliver nation wide. Although from mid New York you should be able to drive in ~5 hrs.
