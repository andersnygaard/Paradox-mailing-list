Okay, I'm convinced! Now my only problem is that the Paradox seems awfully closed up. Can she be built with a more open cockpit and/or are there other chine runner designs out there?

Think of Paradox as a convertible car. With the top up you are nice and cosy inside out of the weather. With the top down you are out in the wind and the sun. Of course, as with a car, this is an illusion, you are really still inside, but, as with the car, it is a pretty good illusion.
