Subject: Re: No response on email to get build manual

I tried a couple email addresses, until one finally went through. I have received a copy from another source and will paypal the money to the email address that I have. So that problem is solved, my thanks to all that helped out. The mast layout is ALMOST making sense with the build guide info.
