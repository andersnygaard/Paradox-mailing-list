Just got back off holiday so late responding to your posting and you've possibly stripped that £120 worth of epoxy already. However...

Non-scientific: the helpline people at Wessex/SP/etc would probably have a fit BUT when I had a similar problem, I wiped over the - non-cured - surface with neat hardener; it went off overnight and hasn't fallen apart yet (as far as I know; I gave the boat to my sister, and we're still talking!)
