Subject: Different Cabin Configurations

Has anyone thought of modifying the cabin/hatch configuration?

Here are a few ideas I had thought of:

3-part sliding hatch to create a longer (2/3) opening
Removable/openable cabin windows
Taller cabin roof in rear of cabin for extra headroom - not sure how
this might work...

I was also wondering how the stove exhaust gasses escaped.  Would a
small vent stack just aft of the cabin be a good addition when cooking
in bad weather?
