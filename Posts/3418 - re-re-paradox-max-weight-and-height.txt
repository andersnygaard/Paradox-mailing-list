Thanks Neil

I wonder how they get into the most fo'ward compartment, the one just behind the stem. Has someone tried fitting a little deck hatch to give access?

Many years ago, I built a 23 foot- or was it 24 foot - I forget now - gaff cutter.  I had the accommodation as all open plan in the end after trying it with partitions. 

This boat was quite a bit bigger than the Paradox although the length of the cabin was not much more due to the space taken by the cockpit and aft locker in the counter stern. My gaff cutter had more room though, because of greater beam and depth.  

The reason for having the inside open with no interior partitions was to give good access to the forepeak and to avoid making  clustrophobic   tiny compartments.

Has anyone thought of modifying the Paradox along those lines? It would mean a redesign of the vent/control line box on the port side and strengthening of the ship where there is now bulkhead No2, but all do-able.
Any thoughts?
