For completed boats I think Bill Sergeant's web site 
http://www.smallsailboats.co.uk/
has a fairly complete list.

As for those under construction in UK, I have heard a number of 
people express an interest in building but am not sure if any have 
started yet. There was a chap in Cornwall who was quite keen..... 
Are you there Neil? How is it going?
