Subject: Re: replacing wood spars for aluminum

Based on the rule of good guessing. "What looks right is just about as good as the best" I myself would select an outside diameter which is close to the original wooden item. Then I would select a wall thickness which would give a mass similar to the original item. Try to find a catalog of tubes which tell you the weight per foot of each size. I tried once to do the math for strengths of tubes. I got a good headache. Steve Yahn

I intend to use aluminum round tube to replace the wood spars on my (decreased) Paradox style sail.
Obviouis question is of course...what size regarding diameter and whall thickn.
I've done a search on this topic but not much to find.
My sail is something like 7sqm.
Any suggestions,other than using wood spars (grin-grin) are welcome.

thanks
