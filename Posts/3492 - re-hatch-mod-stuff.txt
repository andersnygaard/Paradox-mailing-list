Subject: Re: Hatch mod stuff

My key factor here is that I would like to build something simpler than the sliding hatch. A strong, waterproof fabric secured, over a lip, by bungee cord and clips will cover the hole in the cabin roof  and be easily folded back in the pleasant conditions of the English Summer. It will also be sufficient closed for ordinary rain. For seriously bad weather, a board of ply or plastic could be bolted into place under or over the fabric and give the security required against opportunist thieves. Allen bolts into secure nuts might do the trick, and nothing on show to tempt the thief. A padlocking arrangement would be feasible. It would also be nice for my knee to be able to sit on the seat whether the hatch is closed, or not. 

What about a transparent plastic pram hood?

OK I'll get my coat......
