Subject: Re: Glen's Foam cushions

Thanks for the welcome back Dave,

Yes I did mention in a previous post information on my cushions. They were made from "Lux Foam" purchased from Foambymail (very inexpensive with free shipping). At the time I could only find it in 1" thickness camping pads so I had to laminate them together to get the 2 inches I wanted. Later David Beard mentioned that he was able to find it in 2" and no lamination was required. 

Anyway Check out this website: http://www.foambymail.com/BasicTwinFirm.html for any size you want. It is the most comfortable boat cushion I have slept on. 

I used the instructions on your website: http://www.microcruising.com/new2.htm to make my covers and used the same material, pack cloth, you recommended. Thanks for posting the info. Bye the way your new shed looks great.
