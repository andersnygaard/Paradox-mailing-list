I have just fitted one to mine.

I tried it with the transducer inside, but it couldn't transmit through all that wood and epoxy. I'm not keen on poking holes through the bottom, and any transducer mounted through the hull would be vulnerable to damage when drying out or pulling onto the trailer, unless flush mounted.  So I have fitted it on the transom. I haven't tried it yet since I made the permanent fit, but last time out I had it on a temporary bracket and it worked fine.

Hoping for calm nights
