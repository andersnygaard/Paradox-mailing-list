Hi Dave B

Water storage
I use a similar system to you.    30 L of water stored in one- and -a- half litre plastic bottles under the floor, plus one 10 litre plastic jerry ,   fitted with a  hand pump and  located in an aft compartment. Just five strokes of the hand pump is the exact amount for my coffee....

As the 10 L     'ready tank' gets used , I top it up with water from the little bottles and then refill the little bottles with seawater to maintain the ballast weight under the floor. THus easy to keep separate any bad water, which can be used for washing but not drinking.

A few years ago I converted my water- ballast tanks to general storage, so besides the water bottles there is much other stuff kept there - spare anchors and chain, tools,  etc.

During 'average' English type summer weather I reckon to use around 1 and a half litres of fresh water per day.   When making a coastal passage on the open sea I'll have a wash-down of my body with sea water if its warm enough....

Best
Jim
