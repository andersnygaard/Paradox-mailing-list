David,

Matt Layden made calculations to allow someone to build a larger Paradox and it is in the FILES section of the Group page.=C2=A0 In case you are reading with a blackberry or something I have pasted it here... it is not long.

The subject of a larger Paradox comes up regularly with the plea for a scaled-up version and there is no need for a new set of plans when all the information needed is already on the plans as drawn. I set down and came up with some numbers for those interested in a larger version and they are as follows:

    With an increase of 20% (multiply important dimensions by 1.2) you get:

        LOA: 5.04m=C2=A0 16' 6.42"
        LWL: 4.92m=C2=A0 16' 1.7"
        Beam: 1.48m=C2=A0 4' 11.3"
        Draft: .276m=C2=A0=C2=A0 10.8"
        Sail Area: 168 square ft.
        Displacement: 2321 lbs
        Prismatic coeff.: .56
        Displacement/Length ratio: 261

So, those are the principal numbers, but note the following:

    There is only a 15" increase in the length of the living/sleeping area and a 10" increase in the width, which I agree is substantial and would allow for that extra person or the one who has stopped at McDonald's too often, but it is not such an increase in size that it would require a new interior layout. Also, because Paradox is so robustly designed the scantlings (lumber dimensions/sizes) are still usable at this scale (with the exception of the spars), but if you were in doubt, just increase their size by a factor of 1.2. Since the water supply and stores locker are adequate, they could be left at their present levels and yield an increase in headroom of 7.5" under the hatch. Just to put things in perspective consider the increase in spacing of the bulkheads, from #0 to #1: 5.5", from #1 to #2: 6.3", from #2 to #3: 7.5", from #3 to #4: 7.5" and from #4 to the transom: 6.3". As you can see these numbers are just too small to justify a complete redesign.
The most difficult part here was computing the new sail area (an increase of 68%) and displacement (a 60% increase) which would put her on her new lines (10.8") and maintain the same sail area to displacement ratio.

By the way, if 16.5 ft is too big for you, the magic number for a 16-footer is 1.16 and will yield a displacement of 2075 lbs and a sail area of 148sq ft.

I hope that helps,

Andrew
