Subject: Re: big guy in a small boat

I'm 6'5" 180 lbs and also woder if I would fit or be comfortable in these tiny sharpies. I sure like the idea though. If I were to increase the overal size of the Maradox or Micro by 10 or 15 percent than I may have a better fit withoutout all the claustiphobia (SP?) and head bumping.

I think comfort is relative to what you are used to. I have no doubt 
in my mind that you could "fit" in a Paradox, but whether or not you 
would be comfortable is another thing entirely. You have to remember 
that this boat is quite small.  To me, it's more like being in a car 
or a two man tent. If at all possible, I would definitely encourage 
you to see the boat in person.
