In NZ trailers don't need to be braked when the trailer and its load weigh less than 2000kg. In the UK trailers don't need to be braked when the trailer and its load weigh less than 750kg.  That's a big difference!

I just knew that you two (Al & Jim) would try to convince me to launch and wait for the tide, but I don't think that is very practical where I'll be sailing (I'd be waiting forever if I chose to sail on one of our lakes). I priced getting a trailer made for me, but that kind of money is unrealistic. So now I'm looking to modify a second hand trailer, so Jim's shorter tipping design is out since it's bespoke.  However looking at your design, Al, it appears to be just a long flat trailer with rollers. Is there any tipping component involved?  How long is it?

Clearly neither of you have any fears about ripping your stem out and are quite happy winching your boats onto your trailers. That was something that I was scared of doing to my last boat.
