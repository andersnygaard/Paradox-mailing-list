I see from my photos that I started laminating the front and rear blocks to the deck in January '03. All the woodwork was finished and it was ready for painting early March, and I launched in the middle of April. I seem to remember I spent quite a while fiddling with the hatch to get it running smoothly.

Hoping for calm nights
