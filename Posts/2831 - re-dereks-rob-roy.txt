Thanks Chris

The portability is a big issue. Caleb takes two to lift on and off the car (at least it does with my back} this canoe can be balanced overhead on one hand.
The vendor has an ama on the oneside to give extra stability for fishing. 
I'm more interested in rivers but not whitewater. My bum still hurts from a whitewater encounter with a rock over 12 months ago.
The right price is whatever my wife will let me pay:0)
If I fit a couple of buoyancy bags fore and aft will that give me a bit more safety margin?
Thanks again ...  Derek
