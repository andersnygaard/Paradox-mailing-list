Subject: re enigma

I too would buy plans, especially if they were as reasonably priced as paradox plans. There has been a discussion on microcruising recently regarding building enigma from the cad drawings on Matts construction description. I'm sure this would be possible but plans make the job much easier. Turning out a basic hull is one thing, but working out the exact positioning of various fittings etc to make the boat function optimally is something that can only be done with a lot of time consuming trial and error.

I've long been interested in Swamp Thing. Enigma is a refined lighter version. Matt, along with many other designers, has justifiable issues regarding possible litigation if someone is harmed using one of his boats. Still, I do hope he makes plans available - I'm sure he would have many takers.
