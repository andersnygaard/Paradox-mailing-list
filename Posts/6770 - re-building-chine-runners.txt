What I did was to make a template of the bottom edge curve Just before the bottom was put on. I made the template by clamping some bendy plywood scrap, (one long piece) and tracing along the bottom edge of the side panel.

After the bottom was on I added more wood to the bottom panel so as to make it wide enough for the portion which needed it. Then I cut curved strips (3/4 inch stock is what I happened to have) of clear-ish pine using the template traceing. The lower edge controlled by the tracing and the upper edge controlled by the drawing dimensions. I glued and screwed this onto the hull. I was carefull to remove all the screws when the glue dried as I worked this part. This gave me a stair-step build up. I used the plane and belt sander to finish the angled contours.
