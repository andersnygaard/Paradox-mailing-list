Subject: Re: parachute anchor

Thank you DC, for filling me in on using a bridle to adjust the lay. I doubt it will be easy to hove to with the Paradox sail but perhaps a small trysail sheeted flat would work. I should think deploying the sea anchor early would be the best defense. You're correct about the chute being a mule. I may just take your advice and lengthen the shrouds now before their ever needed. Thanks again.
