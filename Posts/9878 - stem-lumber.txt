I'm to the point of making my stem.

Running things back at 30=C2=B0 (slightly more than 29=C2=B0) it looks like I'll need 2x8 (1.5" x 7.25") stock to make the 3x laminations from by the time it gets to the back.

At about 700 mm (2' 4") each, I need a 8 ft length.

It's 2022 and in the US Pacific Northwest, a 2x8 - 8ft piece of CVG Douglas Fir is $150 - $200.

#2 lumber is about 10x cheaper.

The question: How important is it to go with really good lumber here for the Stem?

My initial thought is...it's a bloody important part of the boat that'll take a lot of punishment. But to be frank, I'm not sure construction grade (#2 lumber) would really be that bad.

Thoughts?
