Being tall is not, in itself, a problem, though you would need to consider your options for allowing your feet into the "forward stateroom" for sleeping.

What may cause a problem is how your height is distributed. I have a friend who is 6ft 2in. He has short legs and a long body (relatively) and found sitting inside with the hatch shut too cramped. If he had long legs and a short body he would have no problem.

My personal opinion is that it would still be a lot more comfortable than sitting out in the weather in an open boat.

I am quite sure the paradox is all I want and need in a sailboat, but I am concerned I will not fit comfortably inside. I am six feet eight inches tall and 315 lbs, does anybody think I would be uncomfortable sailing in Paradox.

Thanks,
