Hi,

Glad your back Chris. I have just started back on my Paradox also. I had the opportunity to buy a Paradox really cheap, She's no Zoe, but she's strong. So I'm sailing her while building. It gives me a great opportunity to get to know the boat.

The Ice Box Idea would be a good one, But I don't think there would be enough room. That space is pretty small. Its so small, I'm going to leave bulk head #1 solid and water tight, because I can hardly get to it through that space opposite the battery.

I wonder how many People are building Paradox?
