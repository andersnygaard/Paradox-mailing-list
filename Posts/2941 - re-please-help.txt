Depending on which part of Jersey, you can get all you need from M.L. Condon in N.Y. somewhere close to the Hudson, GOOGLE or WoodenBoat Magazine can find their address and phone number. In the other half of Jersey, South Jersey Lumberman can fix you up. Same sources for their address and number. On balance, if your budget can stand it, Condon has the best plywood you can buy in North America. Harbor Sales in MD also has great plywood. Both places nave pricey but perfect plywood! Douglas fir should work for most of the structural lumber.

Get a bill of materials while you wait for plans.

FGCI has the best price I've found for epoxy, $35/gal.
