Hello Paradox fans,

I have a question,

A major part of the paradox design is the chinerunners, what is so difficult about them, as I see them, as no real big deal to apply, form, whatever. The plans show them as very simple. Would anybody care to elaborate?? This is a question about the DEFAULT materials....

If this has been gone over and beaten to death point me in the right direction.

I have plans in hand :)
