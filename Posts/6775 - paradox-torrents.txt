Subject: paradox torrents

Hi Guys,

New to the Paradox forum. Thinking of building one soon down here in South Africa. Been going through all the content on the group, impressive. One thing thou, I see no one is seeding the 4 mpg torrent files (paradox1.mpg, paradox2mpg, paradoxreefing.mpg, paradoxbeaching.mpg).

Is it possible for some one to seed them again? Or are there links to youtube for these clips?

Thanks guys and good luck with your builds.

Smilicus
