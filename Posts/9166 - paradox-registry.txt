Subject: Paradox Registry

The Paradox Registry database table probably needs some updating. I haven't been keeping up with the group posts for a while, and this probably will be my last post.

1) The current settings allow any member to add their newly built boat. I'd recommend not adding it to the register until it has been launched.

2) Acquiring a Paradox is different. The existing registry listing needs to be edited. Only the group moderators or I can edit existing rows. I'd recommend the moderators keep that setting. If you acquire a Paradox, you'll need to ask a moderator to update the record.

The remainder of this post is just for the curious.:  This group has added to my quality of life for a number of years, and I am very appreciative of all the support provided by its members. I started to build a Paradox a couple of times, and didn't follow through - distracted by other boats. I briefly acquired a Paradox, and enjoyed many aspects of the boat. All boats are a compromise and every aspect of each boat is a compromise. I realized that I am a one displacement boat guy, owning two displacement boats. The other displacement boat I own (an '87 Rob Roy 23') appears to be the best compromise for me. I'll be focusing my efforts on the RR23, which for a boat-whore like me, is very surprising. Fair winds friends.
