Andre lives about 2 hours north of Quebec city in Quebec. It is a beautiful place to visit. I delivered motorhomes in that area. He has also designed the gorfnik, an 8 foot puddle duck version of the paradox. If you have to drive to pick up a paradox take the time out and enjoy the boat on the way home at the many lakes along the way. Make a vacation out of it and it sounds better.
