Hi Jack,

As I learn the yahoo groups portals, I came across your post about selling your Paradox. Please disregard my previous post and accept this one as an invite to my area for a sail on my larger sailboat on Oneida Lake. Just shoot me an email when you can come up to visit.

If you are interested in knowing more about this unique boat, please visit:
