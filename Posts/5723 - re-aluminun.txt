Why do you want alu. instead of wood?

To me it seems to be no advantage at all for the boat. Easier to build 
though.

I have a pipe diameter of 63 mm X 3 mm wall.

That seems to small for me.

Experiment with your pipe between two sawhorses and some weight in the 
middle and compare it with some pieces wood screwed together in a box 
section close to mast-dimension.

Wood should win clearly...
