Hi just a few thoughts, 
5 x 1/4 ply sheets should keep weight down, 
4 x 20l containers for ballast. 
cloth top rather than hard, 
(How often do you shut the hatch whilst sailing, and sail from 
inside?, 
looking outside today (UK) seems a good idea to shut to and even to 
put on heater!) 

Depth of hull will be 2ft, 
length increased to 15ft, 
Beam a little wider at 5ft, 
sail will be dinghy main sail with top cut off to be a standing lug 
Mast will be 11ft x 3" dia soft wood. 

I will lose a few of the paradox specialities such as the inside 
rudder, and inside sail furling, and the water tight sonrkel tube to 
start with to keep weight down.etc, 

But I hope I keep to the paradox theme. 
any thoughts. 
Yours James
