Hi Derek,

Paraphrasing, Phil Bolger says in his building plans, "Natural wood can be any species having good gluing properties. Relatively soft, flexible types, spruce, fir or cedar, are preferable to hard and stiff woods, except where "Hard" is specified."

I would not choose wood that is prone to splitting and checking if possible. I would not depend on epoxy to turn cheap wood into quality wood. Better to invest in good quality wood to begin with. A good local lumber yard should assist you if you tell them what you are doing. Take the plans with you. Short pieces can be scarfed and if you figure the wood might be too soft you can increase the dimensions to get the required strength.

I would never use plywood as it's fastener holding properties are very much inferior to natural wood. I would certainly consider laminating two thinner strips of harder wood  together though, because the grain will all be running mostly fore and aft that way. Plywood has every other layer running crossways which is useless when ripped into strips IMO.

Hope that helps, Nels
