Hi Matt,

The copper strip is a grounding plane and must be in the water. With out 
taking the time to go look I think that I have some pictures in the 
files section showing how I tackled it. If memory serves me I got the 
copper from a piece of flashing bought at a roofing supply house. After 
cutting it to size I drilled 3/16 inch holes about every six inches 
around the edges and then countersunk the out side. It was then vacuum 
bagged to the hull (you can use any small vacuum source for this) and 
the counter sunk holes act like epoxy rivets to give it a good 
mechanical bonding as well as the glued inside surface. The flashing is 
about 1/16 inch thick so I then covered the lot with micro balloons and 
sanded it fair to the bottom.

Hope this helps

Glen

Working on the chine runners right now, then.. rollover time!
