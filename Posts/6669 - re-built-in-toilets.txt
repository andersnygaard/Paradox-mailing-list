Subject: Re: built in toilets

Hi Fred.

I also have just purchased build plans and sail in Ontario waters on the north shore of Lake Superior out of Thunder Bay Harbour so I also share your head issue. I have a 27' fg factory coastal cruiser with a marine head. It is made of porcelain with a ss holding tank. Far too heavy, large, and clumsy for Paradox. I have found a plastic holding tank & toilet from Binacle but still far too large. I could have a smaller plastic tank custom made without laying out too much gold. An electrical toilet is also out of the question due to the hydro issue. I'm going to research RV toilets. So far, I'm no farther ahead.
