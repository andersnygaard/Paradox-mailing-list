Why not just knock the knot out completely and fill the void with epoxy?

I've got one very bad knot in the centre of the boom that I am very worried about. It goes through at an angle and on one side of the boom is loose. I'm going to pack it with epoxy but it is definitely a weak point.

I'll have to see how it goes.
