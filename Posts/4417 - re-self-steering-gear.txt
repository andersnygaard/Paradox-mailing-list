Working with model boats is lots of fun for me. When I lived in Santa Monica there was a casting pool at Lincoln Park. A big oval concrete shallow pool about a foot and a half deep. With a cement sidewalk all around. I shure miss that pool. On some big fullsize sailboats of traditional style they sometimes had very big iron rudder straps. I wonder if it was for this reason?

Hello,

I have used this method on two sailing models with some success. A dynamic system is more reliable, that is using a sheet to tiller, and perhaps an elastic band to dampen the movement. I'd guess a dynamic system might be more or less necessary on a boat that has little course stability.
My first model is a sort of Tahiti Ketch (~2 ft long) that my dad made when I was a boy. This boat has a lot of course stability ( I still have it )so getting the rig well ballanced is the first step and then the slight moment applied to the rudderhead by having a weight on the end of a long aft pointing threaded rod seemed to be all it needed. The heading would vary only slightly even in gusty conditions. I have often considered equiping it with radio control but there is a charm to having a mini-voyage, though you have to have a suitable chase boat, a canoe or rowing boat.
The second is another small cruising boat, but with a shorter keel. for this one we found attaching the main sheet to an aft pointing tiller and an elastic to dampen the movement worked ok, still a little less able to handle gusty weather as well as the other
