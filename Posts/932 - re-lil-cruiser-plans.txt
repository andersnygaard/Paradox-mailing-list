Hi Dave.

If you scale PARADOX up all round you will come up with a boat 15' 10" OA X 4' 7" beam with just over a 10" draught. Displacement around 1600LBS.

Dave and Larry, thanks for the feedback.

I need to specifically build all the boat (as inexpensively as possible) that I can, that is as little under 16' as possible. That's where the 15'11" length came from. Without an engine, this avoids Washington state's annual big registration bite (a non-income tax state, WA derives it's income from fees etc.)

Am I being totally naive, or is a sharpie's underwater proflie a smooth arc from bow to stern that is flat from side to side, has chine runners and gently flared sides? If that where true, then understanding the internal structure/bracing in Lil Cruiser or Paradox would be all the additional infomation required?

I have been told by no less than 2 commercial designers that the limit to upsizing/downsizing a design is 10%. Above that, all the boat's equations are thrown hopelessly out of kilter they say.

It sure would be nice if Matt's attention could be attracted to this...
