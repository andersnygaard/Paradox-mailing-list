Hi,

Don't know if you are logging-in here Bill, while on your cruise,
but what great progress. This must be a record for a Paradox, no-one 
but Matt himself has probably been on a longer cruise, either in time 
or distance travelled. Be assured I for one am reading your blog and 
following your progress, from the other side of the world. (NZ)

Cheers,
Alan.
