Jack,

Just some thoughts on the extra cabin height.

My preferred method of increasing internal height would be to lower the floor rather than raise the roof. If you have a higher head position then the boom would need to be raised (the fact that the boom clears my head is a great comfort to me!). This means a smaller sail or a taller mast. If the mast is taller it won't fit inside for travelling and the centre of pressure will be higher.

None of this may matter, of course. 

When the bottom goes on is when it really becomes a boat. Well done!

PS. I find that wearing overalls keeps the epoxy off my vest!

Hoping for calm nights
