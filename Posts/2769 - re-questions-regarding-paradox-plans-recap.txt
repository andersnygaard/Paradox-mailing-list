I bought a piece of aluminum angle from the local hardware store 1" X 1".
It is attached to the underside of the water tank top to capture the bottom
of the bin face which doesn't extend to the floor like the aft ones because
your ballast is mounted to the floor in that area and you want it outboard
as much as possible.

OK, I think I'm starting to understand this a little clearer now,
and why I thought I must be reading it wrong.  Here's why:

In the aft section, the continuous hinges are supporting the edge
of the sole through the attachment to the bin sides, which are in
turn attached to the cleats on the bulkheads.  Forward were the
tanks are, there is no hinge to support the sole there, so the
angle seems to be serving that purpose.  However, if that logic
is true, then the angle should be attached to the side bins and
"hooked" under the floor edge to support it.

Instead, attaching to the sole and "dropping in" the side bins
would seem to mean the edge of the sole plywood has no support.
Granted, it's only about 4 inches max that the sole edge is
unsupported (bulkhead 3,) but still seems "wrong" to my thought
of the engineering.  It seems that unsupported sole section would
warp and sag over time; not a bunch, but some.  I'm probably
over-thinking the issue.
