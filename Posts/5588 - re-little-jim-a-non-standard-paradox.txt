builders manual.... but on drw #12 I have no clue what it its trying 
to tell me in regards to the boom and yard, I have figured out some of 
the yulah.=A0 What troubles me is say... take the yard... there is a 
square in the middle of the drawing with dimensions, I understand the 
length and width at top and bottom... but I don't get the rest. =A0 If 
anyone with patience and time would like to email me to help me figure 
it out I would greatly appreciate it. =A0 Thanks, Rod

That square is a section through the yard at that location. Similarly 
for the square on the boom and the funny shapes on the yuloh. So on 
the yard 700mm from one end the section should be 42 x 38 with 12mm 
radius corners. On the boom, 1850mm from the tack it is 47 x 38. 
950mm from the tack it is 43 x 38.

On the yuloh the flatter side is on the top when in use.

Hoping for calm nights
