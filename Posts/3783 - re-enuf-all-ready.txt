Good Luck Admiral!

The title isn't quite true because she isn't on the trailer yet. That is scheduled for Wednesday.
I have put a photo of the hatch at:

and you may think to yourselves that it isn't much different to the plans. You'd be right. All my variations came to naught and I was worrying about the Summer ending with me still hatchless.

My plan now is to put the boat on the trailer, load it with stores, weigh the lot, subtract weight of trailer, add weight of Skipper (me, Admiral of the Feet Clark D.) and that figure taken from the displacement should tell me how much lead I need???? 
Help, have I got that right?
If so, I will take the lead with me for the launch next Monday and place it where it best trims the boat in the water.

The trailer may need some modifications - lumps of wood placed strategically - but the only thing left to make is the lid of my wannigan (apologies if I've spelt that wrong again, Nels)

Cheers
