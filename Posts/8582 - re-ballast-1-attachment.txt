That's great and I'm pleased that that you're pleased with your boat.  I'm looking forward to hearing of your sailing exploits along the Australian Coast. 

Here in the UK the bad winter weather has set in - it's all gales and rain and long dark nights, so there'll be no sailing for me for while.

So , we in Europe, Canada, and the US are  forced into our dormant hibernating season for now and depend on you guys in Australia and NZ to send us your boating tales to brighten up our gloom.

Best
 Jim
