Same here. It would be very interesting to see a paradox on the move.

I would also appreciate a copy of your cruising tape!

David,
Im finishing up the painting today, Should launch next week. I 
have been shooting some video of the refit, and got to thinking, 
what about getting the shake down cruise on tape. sailing. cooking, 
sleeping, To show what cruising in a Paradox is all about. Anybody 
interested in a copy?

In my part of the country when your wanting to sail the wind never 
blows, but when trying to paint the wind blows like hell, Go figure!
