SUBJECT: Photos as attachments and the Emailed Photo Album

Hello Paradoxians,

I thought I would share information regarding how this system manages photos placed into this forum.

When attaching a photo to a message the photo will not only appear in the message it was attached, but will also be placed in the “Emailed Photo” album folder located via the photos link in the Navigation bar.

The “Emailed Photo” album photo acts like a bit bucket and because of its nature the album may have a disorganized appearance when looking at the collection of photos.

One way to ensure the photos have meaning in the Emailed Photo album – that is a collection of all attached email photos – is to name the photo before it is uploaded. By doing so the photo will have relevance and not be tagged with a generic number - my tests of uploading photos prove this to be true.

As a reminder, the Emailed Photo album is a “system” album and not owned by any particular person.

On a related note: Any photo deleted from the Emailed Photo album folder will also delete the photo from its attached message. Members (users) can not delete photos from the Emailed Photo album; Moderator has the ability.

I hope you find this notice helpful.

Regards,
Deric
