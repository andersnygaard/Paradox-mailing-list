Subject: Re: water tight boot on the Paradox tiller arm

I wouldn't like anyone to think I had a serious opinion either way on this discussion as I can come up with no credible scenario that would require me to set a drogue, but.....

Instead of a sealed boot on the tiller how about a second baffle (a rubber disc?) fixed to the tiller 6" forward of the transom. this would serve to deflect water entering through the tiller slot without obstructing the ventilation.

On another point, if a drogue is deployed from the bow surely damage to the rudder is prevented by raising it out of the water??
