Hi all,

How necessary is the toe rail on this little deck?
I will be texturing the surface and don't need the toe rail for channelling fresh water.

If it is necessary, can anybody point me to a UK seller of the metal toe rail - the type with the slots in?

Much appreciated  .....   Derek

ps Hoping to start putting the mast blanks together tomorrow.
