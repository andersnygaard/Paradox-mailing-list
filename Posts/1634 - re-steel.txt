Sorry for the epoxy post Jack, I failed to check the subject line (I usually do to keep from getting off topic or to change a topic if it goes awry).

negative comments from those who feel strongly about leaving the 
design alone. Please don't feel you are being attacked, I don't think 
that was anyone's intent but rather to preserve the design. If it can 
be built in steel, aluminum, foam sandwich or any other material I 
for one want to keep up with the progress of the builder. Stay with 
us and keep us informed of your progress.

Glen, 

  Even you have posted epoxy posts in the steel posts with nothing in 
the post pertaining to steel, non productive. Rude, could be a 
mistake, and you didnt mean it, I dunno. I will continue my research 
in a private matter. I may share it when Im done, I may not.
