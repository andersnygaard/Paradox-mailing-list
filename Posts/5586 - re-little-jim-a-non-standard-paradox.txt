This is helpful to me as I will begin the yulah, boom, and yard this week..... getting small stuff out of the way ... um.... do need some help though.A0 I figured out the mast due to the append. of the Don's builders manual.... but on drw #12 I have no clue what it its trying to tell me in regards to the boom and yard, I have figured out some of the yulah.=A0 What troubles me is say... take the yard... there is a square in the middle of the drawing with dimensions, I understand the length and width at top and bottom... but I don't get the rest.

If anyone with patience and time would like to email me to help me figure it out I would greatly appreciate it.

Yep, that's how I read it. I don't know for certain that I did it 
right but this is what I did. I made my bend to be from the pivot-
ish area to each end. The trouble with this is that there is 
springiness to the wood. When I clamped the layers of wood together 
with the bow built into the clamping system and some glue, I guessed 
I would deflect them at maybe 60mm. I sighted over both ends of the 
yuloh and a little wood block made 60 mm high just to sight over 
which I put near the pivot zone. After the glue cured and I 
unclamped it I saw that the springback was more than I wanted and I 
ended up with less tham 30mm. 20 mm is about what I got. As soon as 
launch the boat and try to use the yuloh I will know something. That 
is if I ever learn how to use a yuloh. Something of a paradox huh? I 
curious to hear what the oldtimers have to say too.

Good Luck, Steve Yahn
