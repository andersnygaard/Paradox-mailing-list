Panama Bay is pretty tame most of the time (except for traffic I suppose). I used to sail a Drascombe years ago...... many years ago..on the Red Sea. I wouldn't go very far without lots of confidence building. 

The Robbs Boat does look pretty good. I'm going to check into it more and also a design called the Black Skimmer although that one looks difficult to turn upright if it ever went over. 

Maybe one day the Bolducs will be setting up a way to order. I have seen their website in many languages. I think it is becoming very popular.

I would certainly consider adding chine runners (Try it with or without the leeboard) and the Paradox sail rig. 
Maybe a steel plate on the bottom instead of internal ballast? 
I would not attempt any big jumps off-shore until I learned it's capabilities. That reefing system of Matt's makes it as safe as a lifeboat if the hatches are all closed up. "Cork in a bottle." is what Bolger refers to it as a storm strategy.

Robbsboat actually has more interior sleeping room than Paradox!
It would certainly be faster and cheaper to build. Not as strong or heavy, which is another disadvantage for off-shore jaunts. Could be in big ka ka if you hit something or vice versa.
Geeze I just about talked myself into building one myself:-P
