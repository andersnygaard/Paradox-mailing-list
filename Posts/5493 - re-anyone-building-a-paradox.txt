Hi Al.

You will find the lowered floor makes a lot of difference for access and comfort to the "stateroom" as I have already designed that idea into NOLI.
I have just added a photo in my NOLI folder showing this.
When I was doing a bit of work in this area I felt it was quite comfortable in there lying on my side, and that I could have quite happily gone to sleep with my feet sticking out into the main cabin area.
I also have a Brompton folding bike, but I have the extended seat post on mine and it's just too tall to go through the opening. But I'm working on it.
