Pete's boat 'JoHanna' has been added to the Paradox Owners/Builders page at http://www.smallsailboats.co.uk/paradox/names.htm

Thanks for letting me have the details Pete. I am pleased you are making rapid progress, although you have 2009 for a realistic date for launching.

By far the majority of Paradoxes are in the US.

If there are any details needing amendments to the Paradox Owners/Builders page please let me know.

Bill.
