Oops! Just thought of something worrying about marrying a junk rig with a Paradox. The lugsail (being a big powerful lug of a thing) tilts the Paradox over to that audacious angle enabling the chine-runners to do their thing. Am I right so far? The junk rig is as aerodynamically efficient but unaccompanied by the 'lug of a thing' power lugsails and other 'western' sails possess. Junksail are famous for how little stress is exerted upon the rig, resulting in a lot of money saved not having to pay for wear ans tear and the expensive cloth and construction required in lug/bermuda sails. So the junksailed Paradox stands upright and goes really well sideways, the chine-runners never being properly employed. It would be good if this assumption is wrong. But if this is the problem Matt twigged to it a couple of decades ago.

There is quite complete list of paradoxes been built, in Paradox registry, and there isn't listed any currently sailing with junk rig. But there is one currently being built ;) so there may be a good chance to find that out soon...
