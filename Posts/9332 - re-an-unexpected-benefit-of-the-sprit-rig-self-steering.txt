Yes, Peter, I have. I would like to build something much simpler, if I can get away with it.

My idea is a trim tab on the rear of the rudder, that you can slot a hexagonal rod into (partially lift the rudder so it's easier to see the trim tab when inserting the rod) topped by a counter weighted vertical vane.

All I would do is disconnect the steering lines from the tiller, insert the rod and vane (which I would store forward when not in use) into the trim tab with the appropriate degrees orientation 60, 120, 180, 240, 300, 360 and adjust the sheet to get the boat balanced. I think the boat can point higher than 60 (300) degrees, more like 45 to 50 (315 to 320) degrees, but 60 would be my starting point, just to see how it works.

Cheers,
Rob.
