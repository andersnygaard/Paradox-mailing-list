Subject: Re: Kit for Paradox

Alec Jordan of Jordan Boats http://www.jordanboats.co.uk has agreed  
to supply me with his first `kit' Paradox.

Matt Layden and Alec have been working together on this project.

For more information contact Alec at alec@j... .

PS

If there's anyone out there (particularly the USA) who would like to 
manufacture Paradox kits under license, or any other plywood boat, 
even your own design, I'm sure Alec would be very keen to hear from 
you.
