Should be a nice boat... Matt Layden gave his blessing on that instruction in files for stretching the Paradox design 20%.

You may be approaching the limits because your spacing will be around 3' 10"+ or almost 4 feet between the center bulkheads well 1,187.5mm but i am an old fogey and think better in non metric.

Ideally on an ocean going boats especially.. stations should not be spaced farther then 3 feet and 2 is most common. 

I might notch the bulkheads and bend 1x2 stringers or 2in wide strips cut from 3/8 ply and laminated double layered (3/4 ply is hard to bend).. around them before overlaying with plywood. You can use drywall screws like clamps to hold them tight for the glue to dry and remove the screws after the epoxy has set. 

I might add 2 on each side between the chine log and the sheer clamp. This would stiffen the sides a little without adding more stations and i think would handle hull flexing up to 20 feet.. above that it should really have more ribs or stations inserted.
