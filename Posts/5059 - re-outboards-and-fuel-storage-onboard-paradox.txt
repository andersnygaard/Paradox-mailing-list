Hi Ray,

I would suggest Dave's combination he uses on Swamp Thing is worth a try with perhaps  a second battery and  solar panel added if required later- one set in each hull. One set for entertainment and the other for navigation. Those little gel cells are really compact and don't suffer as much from deep discharging as do wet cell batteries, and therefor work quite well with solar charging.

CD's and DVD's are obsolete Ray. Go with flash memory such as the ipod or SD card players. No moving parts and you can store lots of music, video and games on a tiny device that you can wear around you neck, or maybe included in your cell phone, which you can also use to takes photos or send messages as well.

Or better yet, carry a harmonica;-)
