Subject: Re: Stitch and glue Paradox?

The "Cachivache" was built with this technique, steech and glue.
Use plastic seals for electrical installations to join the parts with putty and then did the steaks.
After I put strips of fiber inside and out.
You can see on the site www.derawson.com.ar / fotos.htm some pictures.
