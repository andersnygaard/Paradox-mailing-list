There is a definite knack to furling that sail. I've got a couple of whooper blisters on my fingers, partly through my own incompetence. There does seem to be a bit too much friction in the system so I'll have to check things over and see where I've gone wrong. First blister occurred when hauling on the downhaul without realising that the halyard had cleated itself. It doesn't matter how hard you pull the sail won't furl. After a couple of successful furls I then got to a situation where it just wouldn't furl the last few feet. it was as if the something had jammed. further investigation showed the major drop off. I hadn't wound enough line on the furling drum, and after several raises and lowering the sail started to wrap itself more tightly on the boom. Of course this meant more revolutions per furl, and I had run out of line on the drum!

Been there, done that.

Lesson number two pulling with all your worth against an empty drum just rips flesh. I did also notice that it got progressively harder to furl as the sail lowered. Again I discovered that filling the drum with line improved the purchase with the apparent larger radius drum.

I find I often get blisters at the start of the season. I carry a pair of sailing gloves which I put on when needed until my hands harden up a bit.

You'll be able to show me all your tricks at Beale. Pete

See you there.
