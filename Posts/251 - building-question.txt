Subject: Building Question

In Don's articles he talks about making a pattern from the outside curve of the hull before the bottom is put on. This is to be used later when constructing the chines.

I was trying to figure out how the pattern is used.

Is the chine constructed per the above pattern to already have the horizontal curve in it. This would leave only the vertical bend in during installation.

- Or -

Am I missing something?
