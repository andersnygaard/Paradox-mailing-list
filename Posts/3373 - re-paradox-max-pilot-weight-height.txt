Hi Bill,

I'm sorry to hear that you couldn't get the link to work. It was actually a photo of Jubilee, the 40' sharpie that is in the Hogfish Maximus folder in the files here:
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/paradoxbuilders/files/Hogfish%20Maximus/

The photo shows Jubilee on a travelift and the chine runners are clearly visible. You have probably seen the photo before.

Best,
Nels
