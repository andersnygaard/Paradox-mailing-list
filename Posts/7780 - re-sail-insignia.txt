Subject: Re: Sail Insignia....

Let me digress though... It certainly isn't for me to decide. I am of the firm belief that the designer himself is the only one that can say "Yep, that's the insignia I am choosing to represent my design". I would just like to have some insignia that we can use, whatever it is. :-)
