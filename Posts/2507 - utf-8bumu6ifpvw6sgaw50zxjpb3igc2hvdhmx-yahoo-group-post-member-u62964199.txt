Hi Glen,

I searched through the files and could not see anything about your installation of the foam linings. (ceilings?)

Some of us recently had this same discussion, when Bolger re-designed Birdwatcher with a foam lining added. So I am interested in what kind of foam you used and how you attached it to the doorskin? And did you leave ventilation above and below the panels so air could circulate?

We would also like to hear some details about you trip in Hogfish. Particularly your sailing impressions and how the rig worked. You know, all the nitty gritty. What kind of average distances could you make good in a day? How was the motion and pounding? Basically an hour by hour summary would suffice, along with lots of photos:-)

Cheers, Nels
