It would be quite straight forward to modify the opening into the forward compartment so that your feet could extend into that area. I sometimes wake up to find that I have shuffled down the bed and my feet are in there.

I built my Paradox as close to the plans as I could (see www,as4jg.freeuk.com) and Under the closed hatch I get a clearance of 930mm (about 36.5"). If necessary the top could go up a bit, and the floor could probably be lowered.

Hoping for calm nights
