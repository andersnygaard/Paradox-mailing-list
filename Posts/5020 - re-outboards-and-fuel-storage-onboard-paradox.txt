Hi Denny,

We've been discussing stoves and other things on the AiT forum. Harry
came up with the idea of using a miniature Microwave oven. Sounds far
fetched until you look at the amount of time you'll use it for each
task and the current drawn. The tiny iWaveCube Microwave oven is only
10" X 10" X 12" and weighs about 10Lbs. The input power is 600W and
outputs 350W. It will take longer than the average home unit. Probably
3-4 mins to boil water for a mug of coffee and 10 mins to do the main
meal of the day. You then have all day to put back the energy into
your 12V batteries. A backup stove (sealed gas cartridge type) could
be kept onboard in case you overeat or use the electric OB more than
planned!
