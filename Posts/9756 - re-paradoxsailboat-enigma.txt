I created a page with a lot of info on Enigma which I gathered over the years. No plans, though!

I purchased the Paradox plans and construction book years ago. I hope to build something similar to the Enigma 460 someday. Right now I am too busy building a cabin in the woods!
Check out George's blog on building his E460: http://e460.blogspot.com/2007/

I purchased the plywood for the Enigma several years ago but I may use that to build a Gorfnik instead!

Deric, you are right, there are no official plans for the Enigma.

However, the basic plan is available online with notes from Matt's original build. I will be building from it, starting soon I hope, I have made a model and it looks right. I would like to have a lighter boat than my Paradox for exploring places which do not have a boat ramp.

Here's the link:

Looking forward to warm sailing weather, it's minus 20 here again today. All one can do here is dream, or maybe go ice sailing if brave enough.

Cheers!
