Hi, I made my mast round and hollow, a birds mouth mast. Had a boat builder make the staves and I planed and sanded it. It was an expensive build. Made from hoop pine. It's about 20 lb too. Would an aluminium mast be lighter? They make mast sections and they are not prohibitively expensive, just fashion a wooden foot that fits the mast box. Nick (Thor)

My mast is made according to the plans but since it is not made of Douglas fir, I increased its size by the amount noted on the drawing. I also didn't take much off the corners and used a little extra fiber glass cloth. I see where some people have weighed their mast at 22 pounds, mine came in at 32 pounds. I think I will attempt a tabernacle and hinge it. There are many versions out there and if I am not successful  it will be okay, I'll rebuild and keep the weight down. As it is, my son or son-in-law can handle it but I need to be able to handle it myself. Thanks for the advice, I'll keep you posted.
