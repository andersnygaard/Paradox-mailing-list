Subject: Re: Hot water or soapstone or cement bricks to heat the boat

Hi,

I have camped in the most dreadful cold conditions and swear by dressing well. If I had my hands, feet, and head covered, I was always comfy. A snow line type sleeping bag is a must too if the temperature is below freezing. Small disposable hand warmers under the pillow and in the base of the sleeping bag were used on the very coldest of nights. They warm and DRY the area they are in. I think they are made from vermiculite and iron filings? Last up to ten hours and are cheap to buy, I got mine from an outdoor adventure shop.

Yes, I'm well aware of the water trick to heat sleeping bags, having been a winter camping enthusiast. I understand the specific gravity of water is higher than soapstone. However, isn't there also a question of how hot you can heat the material? Cement, for example, can be heated so hot that it releases energy over a much longer period than water (I own a masonry contraflow heater). I'm no expert at this, just wondering about using soapstone (or refractory cement blocks) heated on a stove as a potential heat source. Anyone knowledgeable on this?
