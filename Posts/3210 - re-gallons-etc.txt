Your're asking the wrong fellow here, Martin.
I'm the guy who did all the bottom, then scraped it off and did it all again. That bit alone was 
A3160.
I gave up keeping tabs on prices; I keep telling the wife about A32000. I'd rather she didn't 
know the truth, in fact I'd rather not know myself :0)
