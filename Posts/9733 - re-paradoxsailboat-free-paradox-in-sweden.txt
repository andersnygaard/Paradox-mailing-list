That is an excellent idea. Small river sailing will be really nice. Just avoided the realy busy waterways. No-one respects such a small boat.

I live in a small village not far from Stockholm. It is called Vagnh=E4rad.

Hi C.

believe it or not, I was about to go and buy wood tomorrow to start building.

I share my living between Hamburg and Toulouse. My Family lives in Toulouse and I was looking for a boat project to do sailing around Hamburg.

How far north in Sweden are you ?

kind regards
Arnd
