Subject: Re: Whitecaps...... Leading the UFC

At about 2:30 PM - Both Whitecaps (going 2.97 knot) and Manitou Cruiser (4.13 k) have moved past Wizard (1.77 k), in the narrow canal they are passing through.

I expect the first two are using a double-bladed paddle and Matt a single. Manitou took a photo of Matt as he went by.

They all hope to reach Ft. Clinch today and will be turning left into the St. Marys River.
