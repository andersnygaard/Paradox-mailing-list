Hi all and I'm sorry to raise this again,

My friendly, but Burmese regime supporting, timber merchant in Bristol suggests American aka Brazilian Mahogany for these items.

I've found a local supplier who can do me a board to cut the 4 items from at at =A3150 plus tax. He, however, suggested Sapele (an African Mahogany) at =A390 the board. Sapele is moderately durable and fairly good working qualities (except planing), but B. Mahogany is durable and good working qualities. Sapele is the harder of the two and in bending strength, stiffness and resistance to shock loads is practically equal to English Oak.

I'd appreciate thoughts on which to choose.

thanks....Derek
