Subject: Re: New England Paradox owners

The biggest thing I am facing is building space. I'm putting up a local listing offering some work in trade for some space, but I don't know if that's going to pan out. I'm not really in a rush, and circumstances are always changing. I'm actually refinishing my family's garage into an office for my Mom's new business, and its killing me inside!

If building space is a problem, make sure you make all the small stuff (mast spars rudder etc.) first while you still have the space empty. once the hull is in there everything gets a bit tight. This also has the advantage that once the hull is finished you are ready to launch, instead of having all those bits and pieces to finish while the hull sings it's siren song.

Thanks for the great reply. I'm looking forward to scooting over those sandbars myself. Even with my 25 drafting 3' 10", I get excited with the thought of pulling up to shore when I get somewhere, rather than always anchoring and figuring it out from there. I gave some thought to stitch and glue as well. The nails vs. stitch and glue discussion had me thinking about how much better the nails could possibly be, especially if someone was to opt for a little extra glass.

Think also how much easier and quicker it is to bang in a nail than fiddle about with ties and epoxy fillets. On boats where weight is a problem stitch and glue is an excellent solution, but if you save weight when building a Paradox you just have to buy more lead to make up for it.

Hoping for calm nights
