I have sailed quite extensively with another Paradox. Interestingly we were almost perfectly matched. We could sail within talking distance of each other for quarter of an hour without touching the controls. If we had been racing I would usually have won as he carried an engine so never really learned to sail up wind efficiently.

This statement amazes me. Either you are exaggerating OR the conditions you are referring to were upwind sailing, with less than a 2 knot breeze in smooth water OR my much higher aspect Paradox sprit rig has turned 'Mini' cantankerous! I never adjust the rig once it's up, same as with the standing lug, but I most certainly use continuous tiller input in anything other than what I've described above. Even in those perfect conditions, I doubt I've gone any longer than 5 minutes without some kind of tiller input or weight shifting.
