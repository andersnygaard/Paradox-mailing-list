I meant balance as in weight distribution. On a tack if I have too 
much weight forward it hangs nose to wind, if too much weight aft it 
won't come up into the wind.

How would you unbalance or balance the boat ? I have netural rudder
and the sail set so that if I am hit with a strong gust she will want
to head into the wind. I think I have my sail balanced right, but
still having trouble tacking in light air.
