the short answer is that neither wood is good for traditional boats. Alder has poor rot resistance. Hemlock is only a little better and is notorious for warping with humidity changes. 

Modern "enhancement" methods, i.e. epoxy saturation, can go a long way towards making these woods usable on a boat. you might be better off just using a more appropriate species, however. Fir and Larch are better, Usually sold as 'Hem-Fir" most contains little actual hemlock. The good hemlock goes for trim 'cause it stains nicely.
