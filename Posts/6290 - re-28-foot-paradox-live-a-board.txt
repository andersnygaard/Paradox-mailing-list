Hi Ashe,

Since David's unlikely to be online for a while, any chance of a full rundown on your Channel experience on the 28' Paradox? It would be great to know:

how well she sails
how stable she is
how she's fitted out
whether she has a lug sail (and other info about the rigging)
what the draft is
what her cruising speed was.

Did you take any photos?

Many thanks,

Stephen
