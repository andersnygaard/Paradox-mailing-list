Subject: Re: Enuf Update &amp; now Ballast as well

Thanks Nels

And how does one spell HELP in International Red. Is International Red a language like Esperanto, or a specialised technical language used by helicopter crews?  :0)

To be honest I'd have to be in vary desperate straits to accept a ride in a helicopter; there are too many moving bits for my liking.

More seriously, on this question of ballast. I have a number of 11kg (23lbish) lead pigs. Forward of, but against, bulkhead 2 is my 12v 55Ah maintenance free automobile battery. It sits just to port of the centreline. I intend to bolt a pig (of lead, before Nels comments on ill treatment of porcines) to the same bulkhead to balance the battery.
In front of, and against, bulkhead 3 I have created two spaces with screwed on lids that will each take 22kg of lead (or about 30kg each if I repour the lead to fit the spaces exactly). These are also either side of the centreline. Including the battery, there is 66kg of ballast on the centreline of Enuf. 
Behind bulkhead 3 are my two anchors and chain - about 20kg - and space for 30 litres of water just in front of bulkhead 4.
Also, there are my food storage bins from bulkhead 3 forward to bulkhead 2.
Lastly, there is me sitting in front of bulkhead 4 either on the seat or on the floor. Alternatives to sitting include laying terrified between bulkheads 2 and 4. Unprepared to reveal my weight to the group but suffice to say that in terms of pigs I am a very porky one.

Have I enough ballast? Is it correctly placed, or should some be further out from the centreline and nearer the sides of the boat?

Thanks all for any advice, comments, help or humour      ....  Derek
