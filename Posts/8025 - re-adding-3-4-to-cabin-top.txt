Thanks, that the kind of info I need.  Do you think that, if the
height at the edge remains the same and the deck was given
significantly more camber, would the boom clear?

It is only the corner that is a problem, the boom has to be able to 
rotate about the tack strut deck fitting.

However, if you raise the roof you will have to sit higher when in 
normal good-weather mode. This may bring your head into conflict with 
the boom on an unexpected gibe.

There is no obvious reason why you should not lower the cabin sole. 
The loss of water ballast could be replaced with lead.

If I sit upright my hair just touches the cabin roof, but never when 
I am sailing as then I am usually lounging in sybaritic languor.

A tip: Make a couple of notches in the cleats that support the seat. 
When you fold the seat up drop the back edge into the notches and you 
have an instant sloping backrest. Far more comfortable than the 
vertical bulkhead.
