Hello,

I can't help with info on Matt's original sail, but I wanted to suggest that you look into M. Storer's "drop-in" sails for canoes and kayaks. They work really well, even when you're not sailing downwind. 

Check out this link for more information: https://www.storerboatplans.com/boatplans/drop-in-sailing-rig-for-canoes-and-kayaks/

Best regards.
