You think you joke? I did at one time print off some leaflets to reduce the explanation time. Last year I found an on-line printer of business cards offering 100 free so now I have some with a nice picture of Little Jim overlaid with basic information and web address. It saves me a lot of time :-)

Anyway, I look forward to taking it out in two or three months, when my time less constrained. The part I most look forward to is getting a comfortable seat, and just relaxing and sailing. Scurrying about a deck and tweaking lines etc. is not my style. 

Take the beer with you, once you get the boat sailing just lay back drink and take in the scenery or, as I do, read a book.
