Subject: New video of 'Faith' sailing along the Cornish Coast

Al made a few videos of 'Faith' as we cruised in company between Plymouth and the Scilly Isles. Many thanks Al.

I've put the one I consider to be the best on YouTube, which can easily be found by visiting the Editorial page of the Smallsailboats web site.
