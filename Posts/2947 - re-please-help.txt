Don will deliver the build manual through e-mail, as a PDF, for (nearly) instant gratification.

Sounds like Dave and Mindy must be off sailing.

So I suggest you go to the links section at this sire and join Don Elliot's group and ask him to send you a build manual. Or check at Dave and Mindy's webiste for Don's e-mail address at the "sketches" link. The manual is on CD and cost's about $20 I believe. 

It has tons of information  and illustrations on it taking you through every step in the building process. It also has a very complete list of materials and tools and such detail as how to putty and glass the hull etc.

It even has a reduced scale set of plans. And complete plans to build a mini-sized folding dink! You can practice on that if you like.
