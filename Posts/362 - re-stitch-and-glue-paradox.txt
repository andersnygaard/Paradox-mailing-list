I have wondered more than once if the chine runners themselves would not act like external chines. A thick fillet on on the inside and and the chine logs themselves would provide a lot of strength. Seems like an internal chine log is somewhat a belt and suspenders approach.

The main problem with internal chines as far as I am concerned is that the chine logs are usually where rot starts . . . if it starts. The enclosed cabin would prevent water in that are when the boat was sitting in your back yard.

In Don's building notes he describes much tension and myriad clamps in order to get the sides and stem together.  I am not too sure I would want to try stich and glue on half inch plywood that required a lot of bending.
