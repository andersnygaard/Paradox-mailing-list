I thought I would let everyone know that I am on my way to building 
my first boat. I have just finished removing my first deck beam from 
the jig and it turned out dead on. It was much easier than I 
expected and with any luck I will be in the water in a couple of 
years of weekend work. Thanks to all for setting good examples for 
me to follow. It looks like the Paradox will be a fine first boat.
