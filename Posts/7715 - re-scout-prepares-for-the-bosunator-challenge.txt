Thanks for the tip Andrew... I will look and see if I can seat the pin deeper into the yuloh.  Seamanship to everyone. :)

Hello Sean,

The Bosun Challenger sounds like a great idea, wish I had more experience to be part of it. I think I'll stick to Novice, like you suggested. But, sometimes just being the best friend comes with its own responsibilities; my messenger comes with a warm message and informed just this morning via telephone. 

Best, 

Jimmy

Hi Sean's list mates, 

The Explorer Post for the Lexington Council, with the Youth, is still having some concerns regarding their situation. I'm told if they try and hold Princess workshops with the Nelson's, it could mean trouble for them. Doing so, might end them up in court. But, building and exploring partnerships out of the situation could go in their favor.

Scott Yanno had limited available from a message he left for Novazein that's worth reading twice. But, I could only seem to remember the following way: Still haven't talked or seen Novazein, some attachment, like Trentquis, might submit a formal postion for me. 

Hopefully, everything is on the up and up in your world. :)

Regards,
Rhelay
