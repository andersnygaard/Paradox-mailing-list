Hi Eeerik,

I'm not quite sure I exactly understand your question. The head of the sail is always a little shorter than the foot either when reefed or not. I would think that the Cof E moves only a little forward due to reefing.

You're right that Paradox is reluctant to tack, unless conditions are ideal and that deep reefing makes the problem worse.

Eerik, a question for you: would moving the centre of effort forward help?
I've tried moving the head of my sail forward by moving the halyard attachment aft along the yard by 4 inches and failed to see any improvement.

Best,
Jim
