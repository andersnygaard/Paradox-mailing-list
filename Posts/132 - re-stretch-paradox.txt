Hi Pete,

Sorry about the misinformation. I went back myself looking for the thread I refered you to and couldn't find it either. I even looked in the microcruising group thinking it might be there but had no luck. Maybe the discussion was in the smallboats group. 

Any way the answer to your question is yes, multiply everything by the same factor. But in reality, the extra 10 sq ft my not make much differance. If it were me, I think I would want it. The nice thing about the paradox is that you can reduce sail pretty quickly if you find yourself over canvased. 

The real beauty of the metric system is evident when you are doing this kind of enlarging. Enjoy.

Tailwinds, 
Glen
