I get 36 " or 91.5 cm, I got as much as I could get without interfering with the sail rig. I would say you could get those couple of inches without changing the boats lines, however you must pay attention to the boats lines and trim the bulkhead to fit correctly. or just stick your feet into the forward compartment.

I stumbled on the paradox design (via a website) a couple days ago and
I've been reading as much as I can getting more and more excited about
ordering the plans and making one. I was hoping that someone who has
made one could answer a couple questions mostly related to dimensions.

I'm a thin (180lbs) 6'4". I've read that the length of the sleeping
area is 6'2" . In the study plans here
http://home.triad.rr.com/lcruise/Graphics/plans2r.jpg
I noticed that the space between two bulkheads (I think) has a blurb
by it that says "280mm +/- to suit." Does that mean that the sleeping
area could be increased by a couple inches without compromising the
design?

Also, what is the distance from floor to roof of the cabin? I haven't
been able to find this measurement anywhere.

much thanks!
