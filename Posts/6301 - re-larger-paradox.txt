For a cubic foot of water, I think the best average is 64 lbs for salt water.  There are variables like temp. and how salty the water might be. Highly saline water is heavier.  Colder water is heavier than hot water.

Salt or fresh?  I sail in salt, and I've been using 65lb/ft3 salt as my working number for a long time--maybe misremembering from when I last looked it up.
