Hi Bill,

I left each of my beams for 24 hours but patience has never been one of my virtues :0)

I had my sail made by Jekylls of Wroxham, if that's any help. Thanks, I'll have a look at your sail or perhaps some photos of it.

I've got to make the big decision in a couple of hours whether to totally strip the bottom or chance epoxing over the top. At the moment it looks like stripping off, but I am determined to have a peaceful sabbath! Take the rest.  It will pay dividends.  What's the hurry?

I hope that all goes well.

Derek
