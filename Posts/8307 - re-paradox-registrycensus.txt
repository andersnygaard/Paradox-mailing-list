I am now the proud owner of two Paradox sailboats, which are both located in Saguenay, Qu=E9bec, Canada.

For the record:

IOTA, formerly Ironsides, built by Steve Yahn in Port Orchard, Washington State, USA

PEQUENO, formerly Al=92s Boat, built by Alan Ferris in Meaford, Ontario, Canada

The Paradox registry is a great idea. Thanks!

PS I=92ve been in contact with Mike Beebe of Rockport Texas, who sold his first Paradox and is just about finished building his second one. We=92ve planned a trip together for next winter along the Gulf Intracoastal.
