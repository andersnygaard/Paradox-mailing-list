Hello Glen,

Thanks for this post it is clear and to the point, and dispels whatever fragment fantasy's we might hold.

Hello All,
 
I pretty much abstain from making comments regarding changes to Paradox but for what it's worth I will make the following, as I feel well qualified. First I'm as much of a romantic sailor as any and the thought of having an adoring partner aboard who loves the life style as I do does indeed occupy my dreams as well. Unfortunately the reality of life is that it is just a dream. If you and your partner are young then you can probably sail the seas in a paradox because you are agile, in love, looking for adventure and broke and this is the only way you can make it happen and are willing to make the sacrifices, but if you have a few waves under your hull I think you will find that the fairer sex would much prefer more comfort then even a 16 or 18 foot Paradox would allow for any thing longer then 4 or 5 hours and you would be better off sticking to the original design and hoping that some lovely lass would find pity on you in one of your coastal ports of call and invite you home for a proper meal, a hot shower (not necessarily in that order),and a good nights sleep in a bed warmed by your host. At least, having built and sailed a Paradox for the last five years that is my take on the situation. That said I went in search for a small vessel which was affordable, small, shallow drafted and sailed well that would accommodate a mate for more then just a few hours and what I found was a Peep Hen. At just about 14 feet, with a draft of 10 inches and weighing 650 lbs it tows behind a small car very well. It has two nice berths that you can actually raise your knees in with out hitting the bottom of the cockpit, room for a porta pottie that resides out of the way and doubles as a step down into the cabin, a large cockpit, which can be converted into a double with very little effort and a galley area, which you can use in just about any weather. It is gaff cat rigged and can be launched and sailing in less time then my Paradox =E2=80=9CZo=C3=AB=E2=80=9D. And most amazingly of all it really sails well. Not as well as =E2=80=9CZo=C3=AB=E2=80=9D but let=E2=80=99s face it everything is a compromise. Nancy and I and two small dogs spent a weekend aboard =E2=80=9CZo=C3=AB=E2=80=9D sailing during the day and camping ashore in a tent in the evening and had a wonderful time. After acquiring the Peep Hen, =E2=80=9CHedwig=E2=80=9D we spent four days and three nights aboard sailing around Cayo Costa with the "WCTSS" and there is no way she would have chosen =E2=80=9CZo=C3=AB=E2=80=9D over =E2=80=9CHedwig=E2=80=9D for that adventure. What did we have to pay for Hedwig? She cost us a trip from Live Oak Fl. to the out skirts of Philly and back and $3000 dollars. About the same amount I paid for all the materials to build =E2=80=9CZo=C3=AB=E2=80=9D and a hell of a lot less time. Now I have a boat for just me and one for my mate and me and all is well in the universe. If I were to do it all over again I would get the Peep first and then build the Paradox for my self when sailing alone which is what I do 80% of the time.
 
Happy New Year to All and to All, a Well Set Anchor and Sound Sleep
