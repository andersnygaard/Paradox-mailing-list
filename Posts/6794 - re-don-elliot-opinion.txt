Subject: Re: Don Elliot opinion

Hi Mark,

I got your letter in the mail for the plans over the weekend, and they should go out today. As for Don Elliott's construction methods, I don't think that his ideas were particularly unconventional. In fact, I believe most of the building techniques he wrote about were fairly standard, but it was his beautiful illustrations and his detailed instructions that made his guides so helpful. I'm really sad that he is gone because he was a great supporter of the Paradox design and of small boats in general. It's unfortunate in hindsight that he wasted some of his energy arguing with others online who didn't quite see things his way. 

Anyways, if you want to look at some of his old posts at http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Paradoxboatbuilders/?yguid=3D67242575, I'd suggest you do it before his widow closes the forum down for good. 

Dave
