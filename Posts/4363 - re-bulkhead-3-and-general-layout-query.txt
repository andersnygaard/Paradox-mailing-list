Yes, I hadn't really thought that of that and I'm sure a little epoxy filler would soon close any gaps...

Yes I'm trying not to think about that! when my ply arrived yesterday I had no one around to help me man handle it. I'll be able to rustle up some help when it comes to awkward lifts in the future.

One thing that struck me is how inflexible 18mm ply is!
I'd laid it down flat on a couple of blocks to keep it off the floor. When I stood in the middle (all 11 stones of me) it hardly bent at all. I can only imagine what a mammoth task it's going to be to get it to follow the bottom rocker.

You are right to worry, on UK ply there is not enough width to cut out both the complete rudder halves (are US sheets wider?), the tip of the 'beak' falls off the edge. I ended up cutting one half of the rudder from the waste inside b'head 3, even though that puts the outside grain the wrong way. Then I cut the other half in the location shown, but moved it outboard a few inches, losing more beak but making sure there is plenty for the bottom. A beak infill piece was cut from scrap and the 3 parts assembled.

I was aware of the drawing changes but from what you say I'll probably leave the rudder stock for the time being. It's not like I haven't plenty of other bits to fabricate!

Must get back to it now and see if I can mark up another bulkhead before it gets too late.
