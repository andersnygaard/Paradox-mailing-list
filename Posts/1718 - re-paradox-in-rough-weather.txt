Bill,

That was an excellent post. Thanks for your words of experience. I would like to note one more thing about the Paradox. Remember that it is a sharpie, which is akin to a dory. Old dory fishermen knew that one of the advantages of their boats in steep waves was that it did NOT have a keel. They reasoned that a keeled dory slipping sideways down a wave would "trip" over its keel.
