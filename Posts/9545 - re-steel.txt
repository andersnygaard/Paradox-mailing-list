Hi Alberto,

Why build with steel? Plywood is more comfortable inside and is easier to build unless maybe you are a welder?

A plywood boat floats even if flooded unlike steel and offers insulation from the cold and the heat and is not so noisy inside.

Also a steel boat would maybe be a lot heavier to move and will rust if not carefully protected.

Phil Bolger has designed a steel boat for ocean crossing but it is bigger at 8 meters and a lot more expensive to build than PARADOX.
