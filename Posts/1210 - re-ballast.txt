I cast myself lots of lead bricks using an old bread tin as a mold. 
(Paint with Hammerite while still warm for a safe-handling finish) 
These weigh about 25lb each and are easily picked up with one 
hand. After completing construction I weighed the hull and found I 
needed 250lb. When I first launched Little Jim I spent some time 
moving this lead about to get the trim right before fixing it down. 
When I load up for longer trips I remove some lead as I add stores.

When I installed the chine runners I found it impossible to bend and 
clamp in both planes, and I ended up cutting them into short 
sections and gluing them in with lots of epoxy.
