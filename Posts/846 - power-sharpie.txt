Hi All,

As building progresses on my Paradox Im thinking of what to do with Whisper. My thought is to turn her into a power sharpie for the small rivers in the area. She motors great. ( cant sell her )

The changes Im thinking of are:
1) Doing away with the vent trunk and cutting away Blk # 2 (enlarging the access door).
2) Adding a small mast on a tabernacle for the lightning protection and lights.
3) A spot on the deck for six gallons of fuel, three gallons aft of the cabin and three gallons in front. Regarding the fuel, how important is the weight and ballast distribution? (Righting ability?) with no sail?

All this is just a thought. Any comments or suggestion on the subject?

Regards,

David Beard
