Subject: Mk I vs Mk II vs 4 sided sprit

In my experiences with my home-made Mk I sail so far I have noticed that in winds less than 10 knots my Paradox slips to leeward so much that my windward distance made good is zero. As the windspeed increases things get better and better. So far probably the strongest wind I've been in is 20 knots and the boat went to windward very well, even when reefed down slightly and into chop. This is at odds to my previous boat which would go nowhere to windward at 20 knots.

My theory on this is that the hull shape on a Paradox is the main thing that is pulling you to windward, not so much the sail and rudder. The hull needs to be both heeled over significantly and moving at 2.5 knots or better before the it begins to act as a foil.

Originally, I thought the rudder was doing most of the work at resisting leeway, but now I'm not so sure, since it is only at significant angles of heel that the boat resists leeway, which is when you'd expect the rudder to be less effective.

Now this could all be rubbish... which is why I'm wondering what your experiences have been, particularly, people who started with a MK I sail and then changed to a MK II sail. I'm guessing the MK II sail improved pointing ability, but is that because it's higher peak results in less turbulence over the sail's head or is it REALLY because the higher centre of effort on the MK II sail heels the boat more at the same windspeed as the MK I.

I'm contemplating building a high peaked 113+ sq ft 4 sided sprit sail instead of the MK II, so that I can raise the sail's centre of effort significantly, generating heel in light winds, since I prefer doing my sailing in the early part of the day and to be anchored up by the time the afternoon sea breezes pipe up.

Cheers,
