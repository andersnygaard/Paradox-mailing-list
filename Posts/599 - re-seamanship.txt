Very good topic, Dave

In the event you elect to lay to a sea anchor you need to be aware that the vessel will be drifting backward and huge forces can be imposed on the rudder fittings. The minimum forces will be when the rudder is secured in the center position. In practice it is very difficult to hold a rudder completely immobile with rope or line as there will always be some stretch so pulling the rudder blade up will reduce the area that the sea can act on. If the rudder were tied to the side a turning moment would be exerted and, in the worst case scenario, could cause the vessel to orient broad side to the waves and risk being rolled by wave action.

It is perfectly normal to use a sea anchor in conditions less then adverse, for example when you are tired and need sleep and not equipped with an autopilot. You deploy the anchor turn on your anchor light and settle down for a snooze. I wouldn't advise this in shipping lanes like the area between the Florida coast and the Bahamas thou.
