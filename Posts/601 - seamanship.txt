Hi All,

Another option to riding out weather or resting would be to "laying a hull" (I believe thats right). As I am just learning to sail the lug rig, I have not tried this yet. Im not even sure you can do this with the lug rig. Glen have you tried it with Zoe? Also what would be a max angle of heal for a Paradox? I have had Whispers deck almost in the water, she felt pretty solid.Im not sure if it would be wise to heel that much if there was much wave action. any comments?

I have been an armchair sailer for 20 years or better and have read all about heavy weather sailing, but have never put any of it to use. So any comments or suggestions are welcome.

David
