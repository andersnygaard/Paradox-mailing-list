So an old (sea) dog can learn some new tricks? Oh I keep forgetting -
you are getting younger:-)

That's what happens when you keep an open mind. 

Sounds like you two have also created a bit of interest amongst the
dinghy cruising folks. I would be interested in hearing about their
reactions to a boat like Paradox.

"Faith and Little Jim" has a poetic ring about it - maybe even make a
great book title at some point:-)
