I will take a harmonica or 2 or 3 (or blues harp as I like to call them).
My wife will appreciate me playing them off-shore rather than in the back room!
I was thinking of taking a guitar but I think there will be too little space to play while i'm sailing. I may buy myself a Ukelele, I've always wanted one and it seems like a good excuse for a purchase.
Once again my wife will be more than happy that the music will be out of her ear shot :-)

Apart from that I'll have an MP3 player, a hand held mini TV (until they switch off the analogue TXs, and possibly an Asus EEE like Bill has onboard.

For most of the time I'll just enjoy being on the boat.

Anyway back to the sandpaper......
