My Fellow Paradoxians,

It has been far too long in coming...but s/v ENDEAVOUR and I are BACK! The past year and a half has been filled with far more than I want to reveal here, all capped off by the recent death of my father, but by the Grace of God and huge amounts of help from my uncle, Mr. Ronny Johnston we have begun in earnest a strive to finish what has been started! Please take the time to look at the new photos and I look forward to comments from you all real soon...IT'S GOOD TO BE BACK!

Fair Winds To All,
Greg Lockhart
