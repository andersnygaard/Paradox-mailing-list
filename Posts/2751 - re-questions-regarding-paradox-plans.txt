Subject: Re: Questions regarding Paradox plans.

Hi Brent,

I've been wondering that as well. I've had a sail made to the "new" design but haven't made 
the mast and spars as yet. I've cut the blanks to the lengths given in the plans and intend 
to trim them to suit the sail.

Don Elliot has done a coloured version of the mast plan that makes it a lot easier to 
understand. If you can't find it on his Paradoxboatbuilders group let me know and I'll scan 
it for you. Don is protective of his copyright so I'll only do it with his permission. Al Law of 
"Little Jim" fame has also written a good description of how to read the plan.
I'm almost afraid to start on the mast :0)
