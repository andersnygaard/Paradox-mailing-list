Hello all

I have posted some more photos of "Zoe" to the album. One is of me sitting inside to give a sense of scale as requested by Al and four others taken on her first overnighter. All went well, she was loaded with stores for a week and had full water tanks. She could still use some more ballast, maybe a hundred lbs or so, to stiffen her up a bit more. That would make walking around on deck a little easier. As it is, while going forward to handle anchor or dock lines she is still a little too tender for my liking. Once I get some more weight in her it's off to the west coast of Florida for a week-long sea trial. You're gonna love this little boat! Keep building!

Tailwinds,
Glen
