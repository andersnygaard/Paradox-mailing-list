Hello Richard,

Yes I remember now.  You have been really busy since then. I am planning a boat build but not a Paradox at this time.  I still have the plans for the Paradox but more interesting projects on my wish list than I can attempt right now.  I am working on a ply epoxy cabin for a gypsy wagon for my wife and then I am hoping to start a trailerable cruising proa for myself.  Sourcing boat materials can be a challenge here so I may ask what you have found if I get stumped.   Have you posted any photos of your build?

Mark
