Hi Al,

Yes that is my understanding as well. Yet I have seen videos of you
and Bill still moving right along with the hull quite upright it
seems. Maybe Paradox doesn't have to heel much with the relatively
heavy displacement and the amount of rocker?

I expect any slab sided boat will move forward much more easily than 
sideways. If a Paradox is sailing upright then there will be little 
wind. The Paradox is very slippery through the water so can be driven 
by quite light winds. I have never measured the leeway under these 
conditions but I would not be surprised to find it was quite large 
(relatively). It would be unusual to try to beat to windward in such 
light winds as the yuloh would be more effective.

Hoping for calm nights
