Hello, 

I am the new owner of Don's paradox.

I had to recondition the rudder, and the rudder block, and yard. I fabricated a boom and yuloh. My friend Bill, is an excellent wood shaper so he did that for the yuloh.

This past week I received a new sail. I started rigging the boat and discovered the many issues others reported in the past; the difficulty of working the furlor and halyard when setting the sail.

The rest of the boat needs attention as well, lots of sanding, priming and paint.

I am located in Central New York, US.

I enjoy this group. I hope to share more too.
