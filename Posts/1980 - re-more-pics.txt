Great pictures, it's coming along nicely, well done.

How are you going to attach the chine runners so that they are strong enough to take hard grounding?

At first I planned a stainless steel sheet for the bottom, also serving as a part of the ballast. Now I'm contemplating (= getting used to the price) bronze, so that the lightning-protection-grounding will work. The sheet will protrude side-wise so that it serves as the base for the chine-runner, and the body made from epoxy-with-fibreglass-filler.

That sounds as if it should work ok.

A word of warning to all Paradox owners / prospective owners. Keep your toes well clear when launching from a beach! (fortunately it was soft mud)
