Subject: Latest photos of 'Faith' and Mark's Paradox

I've just uploaded photos of the chine runner and the lower gudgeon to http://www.smallsailboats.co.uk/paradox/build.htm

I put the third layer of glass on the bottom of 'Faith' today; so I'm hoping I'll be able to finish the underneath of the boat before I leave for Australia next month. When I return to the UK at the end of August I hope the weather will be good for another month's building.

Hopefully, 'Faith' should be on the water in the summer of 2007.

I've just seen some pictures of Mark Water's Paradox - superb. I'll be uploading them to the Paradox site within the next day or so.

Cheers,
Bill.
