Thanks Don
The picture is very useful.
I hope to cruise long distance but European rivers are pretty well built up and a 
couple of 10 litre bladders are easy to carry to a house or village pump.
As for refilling with rainwater; I wouldn't want to drink it here. Maybe wash in it but 
no more.
Cheers.....Derek
