Are you building a Paradox?

No, not yet. Maybe next summer i can start with it. This summer i hope to build a smaller project to get used with building methods and materials. Im thinking of Hannu's portoquese style dingy, http://personal.eunet.fi/pp/gsahv/dinghy1/simboii.htm.

Another design i have been looking into is Jim Michalak's Mayfly. But that one will be useless once i have finished my Paradox :)

So far i have only studied the plans and tried to come up with a complete material list and fighting all ideas that comes up. I intend to follow plans as exactly as possible.
