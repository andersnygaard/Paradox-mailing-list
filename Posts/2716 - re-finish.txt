Hi Derek,

If the weave is not filled on the exterior, in-the-water, surfaces you will be adding enormous drag to the hull as it moves through the water. Oh, she'll still move all right, but she will be  slower than she should be. 

Even if you don't paint the hull below the waterline, it is recommended that you, at least, fill the weave with clear epoxy or a mixture of epoxy thickened with microballoons so that a reasonably fair surface is attained after long boarding. If you go the microballoon route, paint-on one final coat of clear epoxy to seal all the very tiny holes in the surface. Then sand, lightly, to a smooth final surface.

Or, you can blow all of this fancy stuff to the wind and just paint the bad girl and call it good.

Chris
