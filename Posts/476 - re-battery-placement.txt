Hi Pete,

I'll try to answer both of your last posts with this post. First the drawing you ask about was in message 206. It contained a drawing of the topping lift arrangement that I use on "Zoe". Click this link to go there directly. http://groups.yahoo.com/group/paradoxbuilders/message/206 It has worked so well for me that I am preparing to run the topping lift line inside with the halyard and furling line. When done I will post a picture in the photo section in the Zoe folder.

The answer to the battery question is that all the panels inside the boat are removable, to install or remove the battery you pull the panels out of your way, do your work and reinstall.

Tailwinds,
Glen
