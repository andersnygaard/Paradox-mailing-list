Early on I saw pictures of Mark Waters boat. I thought the interior was exceptional and decided to email him to find out what wood he had used. Mahogony... so I have decided to go with that. I can't decide whether or not to rip them into strips or bend as a whole piece. I have read the document in the files section and weighed the pros and cons and got nowhere.

One point to consider when using ply laminates:-

Bill used ply and on a recent trip with him he was having trouble 
with his hatch cover sticking. It eventually turned out that the beam 
at the front of the sliding hatch was delaminating, causing the sides 
to spread. It was not his laminating glue line which had gone but one 
of the original ply glue lines.

This is probably not a problem for the beams bonded to the bulkheads, 
but may affect any of the free standing ones.
