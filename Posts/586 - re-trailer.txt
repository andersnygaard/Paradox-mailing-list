I have been lurking and enjoy this forum immensely. On the subject of Cedar Key, I wonder if any of you with Pardox's plan to go to the meet the first weekend in May each year. It is an ecclectic event with many small boats home-made and otherwise as well as many free spirits. I have gone for years with my Seapearls and kayaks etc. It's a lovely place and a lot of fun meeting the other comers. I would love to see a Paradox and/or Little Cruiser there. I noticed Dave started his sailing in little cruiser at CK. I hope some of you will come next year. Always the first Saterday and Sunday of May.

Hey Dave,

My hull bottom is 15 inches from the ground and I was fearful that I would not be able to get "Zoe" out of the water at low tide when over at Apalachicola. Any thing you can do to lower "Whisper" on her trailer will be worth doing. There were some other boat ramps in the area where you could launch and retrieve her but not at the park at low water, at least not at the one that I used, I did not inspect the other but was told it was a little deeper. I think you would be ok at Cedar Key also as their ramp is pretty steep.
