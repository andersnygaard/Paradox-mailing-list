Well, the one side is in but unglued. There is a lot of tension there; at one stage it sprang back and bit me. I have a lovely blood blister on the palm of my hand now. I think I will leave it until Thursday, my next day off, and then remove it and glue it. Perhaps it will 'learn' some its new shape! The Arsenal are live on Sky shortly and I don't want to miss the kick off.
