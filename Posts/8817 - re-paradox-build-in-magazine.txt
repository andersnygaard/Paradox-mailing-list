Hi Richard,

I built a paradox to plan in South Australia. I am sailing it again soon, only have six trips in it so far.

I have photos from various stages of the building process. The mast is non standard, I had a birds mouth mast made by Duck Flat Wooden boats here in Australia. If the photos would help I'll send them.
