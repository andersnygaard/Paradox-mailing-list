Hi Jeff,

Quite a few people must be getting excited about the prospect of Noli taking to the water.  I for one, would like to know how she goes; she looks pretty good to me.

My plan is to make it to the West Country in late June, in the Exmouth, Dartmouth area.  Afterwards I plan to trail the boat to Plymouth, then on to Falmouth, being there around mid July and if the weather is good, cruise to the Scilly Isles, where I believe Al also wants to go with 'Little Jim'.

At some stage, maybe, we three, you, Al and I could meet with our boats?

My progress to the West Country will be dependent on me finishing 'Faith' then doing a trial sail up the East Coast to Walton-on-the-Nase and back.  If that goes well, the West Country cruise should go ahead.  There are several 'ifs' and 'buts' - only time will tell.

I bought my sail from Glen - it was in nice condition.  Glen went for the 'improved' design with the higher peak.  Matt reckons it's more efficient to windward - no doubt that is the case, but I like the neatness of the old sail when rolled up on the side deck.

Bill.
