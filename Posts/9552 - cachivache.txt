Subject: CACHIVACHE

Thanks to the valuable collaboration of the group i started the construction of the "CACHIVACHE" (The southern most Paradox in the world) To avoid surprises, (Patagonian sea is bravo), i reinforced panels with angle iron and stainless steel bolts In addition i laminated panels on both sides with fiberglass. In a few days add in the folder "CACHIVACHE" the first images. 

Thank you all.
