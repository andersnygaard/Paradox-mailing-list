Subject: Re: Paradox history and capabilities

Nice job on the CAD files.


If you look at my web site (see my sig) you will see the build took me about 18 months of evenings and weekends. This seems to be about the norm for those that didn't take a sabbatical half way through.

Coasting is much more interesting. Once you are out of sight of land it is just boring (unless it gets 'interesting' when you probably wish it was boring). Watching the scenery go past is much better and you can see you are getting somewhere.

Got it, Paradox was designed for coastal cruising but has some respectable open-water capabilities. After some reflection, I believe I would have more than my fill of adventure "merely" coastal cruising. It is comforting to know a boat can take a beating if necessary. The consideration that concerns me now is construction time. At 59 years old I'm hesitant to start a 5-year project e.g. Wee Seal (I spend forever over analyzing every aspect of a project). The Paradox looks to be about 1-year of work, more or less. The ability to trailer and beach the Paradox is extremely attractive. Hey Al, thank you very much for your advice.

Hoping for calm nights
