Glen,

How about adding to the list about anchoring and anchor stowage? I'm not sure how this is best done. Do people usually have 2 anchors, a bower and a kedge?

There's a question about the materials list. A list is present on the CD distributed with the plans. Is it subject to copyright? If not, the list is ready-made.

Dave and Matt will have the answer to the above question.

Bill.
