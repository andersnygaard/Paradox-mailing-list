Is this Dylan Winter?

He has the extraordinary idea that if you put a candle under a flowerpot it increases the heat output! There was a long thread about it on the Wooden Boat Forum,  and another on (I think) YBW.   Lots of speculation but no experiments or measurements.

On Dylan's web site is a link to a CFD analysis of the relative heat distribution with and without the pot.

I find the proposal for a woodstove quite frightening.

I have never felt the need for a separate heater in Little Jim. On the odd occasion that I have felt a bit chilly (with deep frost on the cabin top) making a cup of coffee has provided enough waste heat to make the cabin toasty.
