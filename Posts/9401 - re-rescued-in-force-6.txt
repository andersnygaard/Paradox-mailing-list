Hi Roselt,

I really appreciated your story.

I think Phil Bolger said somewhere that "small boats can't sail to windward in anything beyond 25 knots in a seaway", and your story proves that. I've probably misquoted Bolger, but I remember the gist of what he said was that small boats are going to be very uncomfortable in the kind of seaway that 25+ knots generates and won't sail well in those conditions.

I also can relate to your impatience to get going, probably not helped by the small size of a Paradox which isn't great for whiling away long hours waiting.

And finally, seasickness would have made it pretty awful out there, so I'm not surprised you asked for a tow.

All of these things make sense to me. Thanks again for your story.

Cheers,

Rob.
