Subject: Re: How heavy is a fully loaded and ballasted Paradox? 

That's silly, of course weigh is equivalent to displacement, as long as you measure the same things by both methods. I think the question refereed to "full up" weight. On a boat this size, that must include crew to have meaning.

If a boat, it's stores and crew weigh 1400 lbs, they will displace exactly that amount of water. 

Archimedes had it right.
