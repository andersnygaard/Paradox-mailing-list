Subject: Correction: First Paradox launched in Australia

I think Zero and I have to give credit to another builder for launching the first Paradox in Australia.  I noticed a Paradox for sale the Saturday before last in the Brisbane Courier Mail for only $3000 so naturally phoned the builder - I have'nt got the ad in front of me so can only tell you what I remember from the ad and my phone conversation with the builder Chris.  I have the ad at home so if anyone wants to call me I can give you the phone number - my number is 07 33725998. You can leave a message with my electronic secretary and I will call back.  

Chis said he was retired and had built other boats before the Paradox.  He said he only sailed it once due to ill health.  
It was built in 2000 and:

- is not insulated
- has no lead ballast (supposedly was sailed with sandbags)
- Dynel sheathing
- has an outboard well which fits 2.2 merc but motor not included
- Sail made from a heavy duty tarp material which is normally guaranteed for 10 years
- Non standard cabin with flat fwd/aft faces.

I think a trailer is included but may not be in great condition.
I have not gone for a look but have asked Chris to pass my contact details to the eventual purchaser.

Sounds worth a look if you were considering building as the price is very low.

until next time
