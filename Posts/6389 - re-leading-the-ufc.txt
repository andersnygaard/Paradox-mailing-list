Just noticed that Pelican is out of the race now;

He's out of the race. There is/was a problem with the mast, and it (the mast) broke at the base and went over. The Pelican and the boat are fine. Someone on shore saw it happen and called the sheriff. They sent a helicopter to check on him, and made sure he made it safely to shore. He is 7 miles south of the Sebastian Inlet CP. Sounds like quite a few folks were there to help him get the boat above the high tide mark. Someone has offered him a room for tonight. For now, there are no other plans that I know of. I must say that having the helicopter arrive while I was on the phone with him was frightening and somewhat comforting at the same time! I wasn't sure that I was getting the whole story at that point. (Our chicks have very little to do with my gray hair!)Mrs. Pelican
