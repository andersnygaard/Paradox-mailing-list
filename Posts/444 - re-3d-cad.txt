When I have finished the model I shall run off a set of pictures showing the various stages of construction. This will be in a month or so at the current rate. In the meantime feel free to copy the pictures off my web site.

If anyone has requests for particular views let me know. Once the model has been created producing the pictures is a few seconds work.
