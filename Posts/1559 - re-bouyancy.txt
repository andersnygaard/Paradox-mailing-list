Here is my general understanding.

A wooden boat will naturally float, even when swamped or holed. How high above the water depends on the amount of supplies and other ballest that is heavier than water vs: the amount of positive floatation ( materials lighter than water - the lighter the better.)

The best place for ballest is as low as possible and for positive floatation as high as possible. This to ensure the boat comes back upright when knocked down.

Since the Paradox hull is curved like a banana in the bottom, the best place for ballest is near amidships, (the lowest point) and the best place for floatation is at the ends. (The high points in the hull.)

The amount of floatation needed depends on the amount of ballest used. The amount of ballest needed is related to the size and weight of the rig.

A steel hull will naturally sink when flooded or holed. It needs additional floatation (over wood) to make up for the weight of the steel, plus the weight of the ballest and any added stores that are heavier than water.

So the question is - how much additional floatation is needed? And how much room does this leave for stores if the boat is small to begin with?

The fact that airplanes are made mostly of steel (incorrect actually) really has no bearing on the matter since no home-built planes are ever made of steel to my knowledge and we are talking home building here.

Looking forward to any clarification or correction to these observations:-)

Personally I prefer wood over all building materials, because it is by far and away the easiest and most pleasant to work with. The warmest, the quietest, the easiest to repair and refinish and has the most character.
