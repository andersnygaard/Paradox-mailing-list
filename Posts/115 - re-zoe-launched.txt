Hi All;

As I posted earlier I launched Zoe on Friday the 13th (I didn't start a cruise so it was OK) and all went very well even though she was VERY LIGHT and I sailed her about two hours before I had to haul her home and depart for Philly. I posted the one picture and will follow up with more as soon as I get home and get her in the water again (this week). I will also include a full report on her sailing qualities but from what I saw last friday she is going to be a blast to sail around in. I also have some pics taken of her final finishing and will post them as soon I can get some time. I can tell you this, I can't wait to get back in her and hopefully will have a little more wind this time. Keep at it you guys your gonna love this boat!
