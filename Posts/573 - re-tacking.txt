Glen and David, I have tried everything except backing, not sure how to do that. I did have a lot of weight up front. Ill try it to lighten the bow next time, what about weight in the stern? I am carrying a 65 lb outboard. good book, I need to read it again. A lady co-worker named her for me, I thought I had an original, guess not. Thanks for the help.

David
