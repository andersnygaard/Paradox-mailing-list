Subject: Re: trailer weight

Thanks, Al, but spending more than an hour at the ramp doesn't appeal. And since appropriate ballast low down is crucial to self-righting, I expected it wouldn't be that simple to adjust load capacity. A better way to phrase my question might be: what does a Paradox weigh, rigged and with all ballast aboard? More than just trailer weight, I want to know what it's capable of carrying--so I'll know both what is damanded of the trailer, AND how much more weight it takes to get to the dwl.
