Subject: Bulkheads In

Greetings Group,

Just came in from my shed. I spent the day getting the bulkheads in the Paradox. It is starting to look like a Boat!

It is a little crowded in My shed @ 7 1/2' X 22'. I set it up so I can slide one side of the boat or the other against the wall and have enough room to work on the opposite side. When it comes time to get it out, I will have to cut a hole in the end wall big enough to slide it out. The only door in the shed is only 24" wide.

Having a Great time with this Boat.

Thank You
Dave Blow
