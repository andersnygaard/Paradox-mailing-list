You might want to start by learning more about epoxy. Raka has a short online guide: http://www.raka.com/UserManual.html

Raka also has good epoxy at decent prices. System 3 used to print a manual. I don't know if it's available anymore. They also make good epoxy.

Green plywood is pressure treated. I don't think epoxy sticks to pressure treated wood very well or at least as well as it does to untreated wood. If you're coating with epoxy, you don't need the properties pressure treating is supposed have on wood.

Cheers,
