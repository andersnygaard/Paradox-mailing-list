Hi everyone,

I could do this but it makes life more difficult because I will not always be around to approve members so we will need a second or third moderator. Any volunteers? I hope to be off sailing for a couple of months as soon as it gets cool enough. Of course we could always just start going to Yahoo to check posts and not receive e-mails. What say yee.
