Subject: Mast Making

I thought I should share how I made my mast. I did not follow the plan precisly. I used two common 2 by 4's and just glued them together. I used my saw to rough cut the taper, per plans. I made the very top 1 1/2 inch square. A little fatter than called for. I bought a .500 inch dia. polyethylene tube to but in up the center of the mast. I used my router to make a rounded groove to fit the tubing. .25 deep in each half. This goes all the way thru from top to bottom. My solid copper 6 gage wire for the lightening and my masthead light wires slide into it nicly. I should be able to replace them when needed in the future. The mast is solid inside because it is such a small mast. I think a more massive mast may have a slower roll from side to side for the boat on the whole. And it's less work too. The wood I bought for this is common lumber with a few small knots here and there. I did not put a halyard sheave inside because it just looks too weak. And it's awkward with the wires inside, as others have noticed. I will put a small shoulder near the top to hold a small bracket to hold a swivel pully for the halyard on the outside. I've done this on other boats of mine and I like it. And it's less work. The plastic tube pokes out of the side of the mast, at an angle, just above the foot. The glue I used is gorilla glue. It is a moisture curing polyurethane. It explands and foams on curing. I'm guessing the tubing will be stuck nicly by this action. Oh and I used all my clamps too!
