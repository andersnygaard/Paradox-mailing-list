At midnight Manitou Cruiser was at least 10 miles ahead of Whitecaps on the portage and planning to go all night. Averaging about 2.8 knots latest spot report. Wiz still on the river. Crazy Russian well up the St. Marys and planning to sleep until he wakes up.  Pelican is still on the ocean approaching the bay into the St. Marys.

Looks at this point the race is Manitou's to win unless he overextends himself. But there is still a long way to go. These guys are warriors beyond belief. Hard to imagine the sleep deprivation they must be experiencing at this point.
