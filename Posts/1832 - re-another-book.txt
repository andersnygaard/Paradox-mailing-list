Howard,

If you've ever gone to the grocery store and watched the stockboy open boxes you can get an idea of what a box of 24 looks like.  Imagine stowing 10 or 12 such boxes.  It doesn't take up that much room.  Also, for a 75 day journey you only need about 30 gallons of water realistically.  Most voyagers are too busy to eat much.  They would stuff the interiors of their boats to bursting leaving only enough room to curl up inside.  They ate and drank their way to more space.

Robert Manry's book Tinkerbelle has a couple of excellent cutaways that show how he packed it all in. You can find that used at www.abe.com or even www.amazon.com .  Cooking for these guys was usually primus on some sort of homemade gimbal system.  Alcohol fuel is very dangerous and shouldn't be used because you cannot see the flame if it catches something on fire.  The Paradox may or may not be an ocean crosser, but I am sure it has enough space to make provisioning for such a trip possible.

I'm glad you enjoyed my book and hope to have another one out in the not too distant future.

Yours,
Bill Longyard
