Hi Derek,

Ditto here in Canada. We get a mish-mash of both Imperial and metric. All our lumber and most building supplies come in inches because of the proximity to the US. How about using 10 penny nails? Just kidding.

Leaving a few 9 mm ridges sounds like a really excellent idea if it can be managed. I believe you want the glue line just thick enough so that the filler piece almost floats on it when it is flush with the plywood on either side, and some squeeze-out occuring. That would be with epoxy thickened a bit to the consistancy of pancake syrup. Most epoxies have the ability to span about 1/16" gaps or even more if thickened. Of course some penetrates the plywood.

Bearing that in mind, I would guess the double joint line would be best in the inside of the boat and the nice, totally flush seam on the outer bottom? When done correctly, that outer seam becomes invisible in the finished boat. My plan is to have poly sheet/wax paper on both sides of the joint while it sets-up and just add enough weight to hold it flat, and some temporary screws to keep it lined up. 

I can't really see any problems if you are using a router. Except for the sawdust and crap. Be sure to use good dust protection as the glue in plywood is probably nasty. Maybe get some photos for the building folder!

Good luck, Nels
