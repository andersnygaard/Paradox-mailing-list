And Al. How do you rate your sail?

It works. As you know I have little to compare it with, but it gets me where I want to go. I had hoped to be able to get a comparison with Enuf, when Derek got the hang of it.

Last year I was beginning to think I must get it recut as there was this crease from about one third of the way forward along the yard to just above the end of the boom. However I eventually realised it was that the tension along the yard was too low. Tightening up the end ties has flattened it out nicely.

Mine is the Mk.1 design, but I see no reason to change it.

Hoping for calm nights
