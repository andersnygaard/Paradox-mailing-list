Hi Al,

What you are referring to is called the "partners" It is a beefed up area where the mast goes thru the deck and helps distribute the loads induced in that area by the sail. The deck goes over the timber you see in the picture and holes are then cut to match. I elected to complete the vent trunk before decking as there is not much room to work with the deck off much less with it on. In the plans Matt says to wait until after the deck is on to cut the holes. Because I wanted to have everything mounted before putting the deck on I had to build a mock up of the lower part of the mast to make sure the control lines would clear the mast and exit into the cabin at the right angle.

Don has just linked one of his sketches from his building articles as part answer to your questions. If you don't have a copy of his articles you should email him and request a set. They will pay for them selves many times over. Hope this helps.

Well, here is another one then. I notice in your photos of the vent trunk you have put a top on it. does this top become the deck, or does the deck ply fit over it? In which case what purpose does it serve?

Alastair - itching to get started, but the wood hasn't arrived yet.
