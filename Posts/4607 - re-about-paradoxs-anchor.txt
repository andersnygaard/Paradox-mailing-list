Thats a call you will have to make yourself Jimmy, I didn't put it in 
Zoe because I wanted to be able to see the inside of the hull to make 
sure nothing was getting wet. Later after I finished Zoe I thought of a 
way to have the foam and be able to inspect the underside of it. I wrote 
up an article about it and it is in the file section under thoughts on 
foam. Was it you that asked if I had written an article about painting 
the hull? I did write one and have been looking for it to reference for 
the person who asked. I'm still looking.

Thank you so much,Glen.

Do you think it is necessary to put the foam on side wall and top deck?
