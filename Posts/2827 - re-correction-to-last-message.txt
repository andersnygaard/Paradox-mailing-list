Hi Chris 

The canoe is a Wee Rob Roy by Ian Oughtred
It is 12' 6'' and beam of 28", depth of 11 and one quarter inches and weight 30lbs.

The owner is saying a displacement of 180lbs and adds that he weighs 182lbs and has 
plenty of freeboard.

I need to make a decision whether to buy it or not shortly.
I'd be grateful for any help.

Derek
