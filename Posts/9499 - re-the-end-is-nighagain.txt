Hi Everyone,

Thanks to William, the new group on Groups.io is now a premium group which means we can transfer everything from here to there.

I'm waiting on a moderator from this Yahoo group to grant me more access to this group so we can do the transfer.

The rest of you; do nothing yet.

The transfer will copy all the members across, along with your current settings on this group, and send you a welcome email from the new system.

I'll announce here when I initiate the transfer.

Matt
