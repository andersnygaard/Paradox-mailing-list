Subject: Re: Best shape for Chine Runners?

I have built a slightly more narrow and slender scale-model from the Paradox plans and i made the chinerunners twice the width compared to the scaled original. I made the wider to test this very aspect, knowing i can sand them down with my belt sander in small increments to test out optimal shape and aspect ratio. My small scalemodel is 83 cm long, 20 cm wide, 5 cm deep rocker, 12 cm high freeboard. The chinerunners are 32 mm wide for a total hull-width of 26,4 cm.

I have found the oversized chinerunners to be a lot better in little wind and low speeds, but as the wind and hull speed increases the boat starts trying to surf on the very wide bottom. It lifts the bow very high above the surface and creates a very big energy wasting bow-wave from the point the chinerunners start extending out from the hull.

Cheers,
Johannes
