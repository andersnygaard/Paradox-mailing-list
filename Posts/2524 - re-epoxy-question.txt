Subject: Re: epoxy question

Thank you, Dave

I haven't tried out USComposites epoxy, but I have tested System Three, Raka (127 resin) and West System. All of them work, but each is a little different. In the end I settled on West System because I prefered the way it handled my needs. I would suggest that before you order a bunch of epoxy from any retailer that you first test out some of it for yourself. Laminate some fiberglass with it. Glue some wood together. Make up some fairing compound with the stuff. Does it gel too quickly? Is it stiff enough for your needs? Is it easy to sand when cured? In the end, you will be spending a fair bit of time working with it; therefore, you want to use a product that you are comfortable with.

Finally, I get my cloth, fillers and most of my supplies from http://www.raka.com/ and http://johnrsweet.com/index.html.
