Apart from being bevelled,  all the bulkheads have a small convex curve.   This is shown on the plans for some bulkheads but not all.
Draw a straight line from chine to gunwale;  measure out from the centre of the line 5mm;  spring a batten through the chine,  the 5mm mark and the gunwale,  and draw the curve.

The sides end up with a compound curve (which is why they are so d**n difficult to pull into place!)

Best wishes,

John
