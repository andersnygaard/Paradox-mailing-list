You are right, it isn't complicated. I too started with little sailing experience. I held the boat head to wind while I hoist sail, then let it blow off. I then followed instructions given to me many (many) years ago by a friend of my grandfather - point the boat where you want to go and pull in the sheet until you start moving.

In time you may find tweaks to make it a little more efficient but that works ok for a start. You will find that Paradox is *very* forgiving of human error. Accidental gibes are quite benign and, if properly ballasted, you can't capsize.

Oh, and make sure you have the history of the design at your fingertips. If your side of the pond is anything like this side, every time you land on a beach someone will want to know all about it.

Enjoy yourself.
