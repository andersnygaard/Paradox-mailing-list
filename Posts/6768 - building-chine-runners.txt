Subject: Building chine runners

Hello Alastair, 

I think the chine runners could be "stack laminated" IE long thin battens are epoxied to the hull following the chines. Screws are used to hold each layer until the epoxy sets then removed and used on the next layer.

I would guess a standard 2x8x8 could be ripped into 1 1/2" x 1/4" battens. The drawings should tell you approximate size and location of the runners. After the epoxy work is done you do a lot of the shaping with a belt sander.

Good Luck send photos or YouTube viedos, 

John

No photo, I am afraid but try this description. When the bottom panel is wrapped into position it is wider than the sides, so sticks out a bit each side. This is then filled with a huge fillet, between the bottom and the side, which is what is visible and is called the chine runner.

The chine curves in both vertical and horizontal planes. I found it almost impossible to hold a full length strake in position to glue it and ended up building it up with battens about a foot long (like building a brick wall) and lots of epoxy.

I can recommend building a simple rough model (balsa for the bulkheads and card for the skins). I built a 3d computer model before I started cutting wood and it cleared up a lot of queries.
