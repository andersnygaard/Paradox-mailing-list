Subject: Re: Foredeck Hatch?

I can just imagine trying to get a type 27 battery (or two) up there through that companion way, particularly since I'll be about 70 years old by the time I get the boat to that stage, and already have two bad knees and a couple of blown discs.

Also, if one was camping ashore, it would be much easier to open the hatch and haul out or stow away the tent and other associated gear while standing alongside the boat.
