Yes - I have a portable DVD player with a 7.5" diagonal screen, but my next toy is going to be a portable digital picture frame. Up to a 10" screen available so far.

You can get them with built-in stereo speakers too! Kodak probably is the best brand I have seen.

My camera will take up to an 4 GB SD card which will record up to 6 hours of video and the card can be plugged into the picture frame directly and played back.

There are slots in these frames for every unimaginable flash media card or device.

And like I said - no moving parts. Works through black magic obviously:-D
