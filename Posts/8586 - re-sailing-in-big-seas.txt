Hi Nick,

Thank you for your very honest appraisal of how things went. Many times on this list and elsewhere we only hear the fair weather reports and after lots of these a feeling develops that a Paradox can do anything that a large keeler can. As your experience proves, that clearly isn't the case. What your report does confirm, for me at any rate, is that small boats can't go to windward in anything much over 25 knots. I think Phil Bolger told us that years ago.

Perhaps a sea anchor might be an idea for next time?

Thank goodness your VHF radio did the business anyway or things might have been much worse.

I hope you're not too disappointed. I wonder now whether you are still planning to sail along the South Australian coastline. Your story is food for thought for my own plans along New Zealand's coast, at any rate, since I'm planning to sail engineless.

Cheers,

Rob.
