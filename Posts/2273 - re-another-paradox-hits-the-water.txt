Glen, 

I have only a camera in my phone and its not that great, ive dunked 3 nice cameras and my wife will not allow me to get a new one, however last night nobody knew where I was putting her in and my sisters wanted to get a few shots of her on the water, I didnt know this till this morning, right now we have a still calm, no wind at all. so im working on either my 1.5 hp or my 2.5 hp. or if I cannot get them going, im going to electric trolling motor, or just wait till there is wind, forcast is for 5-10 light winds. if nothing else il get a few phone shots to share.

Jack

Glen
