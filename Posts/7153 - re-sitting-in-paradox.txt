The footwell sounds like a great idea! I hate sitting with my legs straight out. In my Jewelbox Jr, which has a "Birdwatcher" type cabin, I recently added a low bench across the aft end of the cabin--only about 4 inches high. That was all I had to work with, and I didn't have much hope it would do anything, but I find it makes a big difference. It makes it possible for me to get my feet under me a little to change position (which I have to do when I tack, since JB Jr is unballasted).

Subject: [paradoxbuilders] Sitting in Paradox

Has anybody tried using a beanbag chair as a helmseat in Paradox? My goal is to find a solution that will allow me to sit with my knees bent in something resembling a comfortable sitting angle when the hatch is closed. The solution would also have to be stowable for sleeping. I'm hoping that a beanbag chair will do the trick. If it doesn't work I have two other options:

1. Cutback on the length of the food lockers to create a shallow "footwell" aft of the water tanks and sit on some cushions on the shortened sole hatches. Serge Testa did this on Acrohc Australis. For sleeping, the footwell would be covered by a fitted plywood plank. Downside would be loss of food storage space.

2. Raise the coachroof or the freeboard. I'd rather not increase Paradox's windage.

Ideas, experiences anyone?
