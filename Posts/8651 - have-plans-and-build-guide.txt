Wanda and David came through within 24hrs of ordering the assembly manual (written by her late husband Don) and the Paradox plans were delivered via email as a PDF files. I have been obsessed with this project and want to get started mid-summer after I get my Com-Pac 23 back in shape and in the waters of Lake Erie. I am planning to add tools required to make this project as accurate as possible. In Don's manual he states that a table saw is nearly a necessity. Would a table saw have a significant advantage over a quality jigsaw? Any more info on tools (I have the basics) that would be recommended?

This group has been a treasure trove of information thanks to all.
