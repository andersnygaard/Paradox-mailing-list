In my experience, the Paradox windows are perfect. Great visibility all around, and I have never come anywhere near hitting my head. Actually it’s never even crossed my mind. Same with Gorfnik, where the windows are similar. And yes, the storage of the Yuloh on one side and sail on the side decks works well. Even with the Yuloh in place, it is easy to walk on the side deck to get to the front. But usually when beaching, I carry the Yuloh with me so I can pole vault off the front onto land without getting my feet wet and back on again the same way.

All in all, I must repeat here again that the more I use the Paradox, the more I find the details of the boat design a genius work of art.
