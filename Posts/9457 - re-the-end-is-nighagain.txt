Hello All,

Yahoo group is very helpful. The platform provides a ton of information.
I do not do fb on account of what I believe their invasive data mining. I am hoping that an alternative solution if needed is available.
I still visit the group and planned to upload information on my just recently re conditioned paradox - was owned and built by Don Elliot -- I'll still do so until no longer possible.
Hope to see and read and sail with other paradoxians.

Do any of you have the full email archive (or even a large portion of it)?There are about 9,500 messages going back to 2001.
When I first joined, I was keeping a copy, but then I rationalized my email collection a bit a figured I could always look these up on Yahoo. Hmmm... I guess not any more.
I'd like to archive the contents of this group now if I can, but spidering/mirroring Yahoo is going to be tricky. If anyone has an archive of the emails they can share with me I'd be very appreciative.
I don't know who the group moderator is now. Does the moderator have access to create an archive of the conversations?
Thanks,
Matt
PS. I don't do Facebook, so thank you all for your contributions here over the years. If I do eventually build and launch a Paradox I promise I'll sign up to Facebook temporarily so I can let you know. :-)
