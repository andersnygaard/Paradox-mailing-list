Yes it would be heavy and would make the Paradox almost like a Bolger Micro except for the lines. it would be far harder to trailer.

Fred,

Many have inquired and a few have considered it (myself included), but I think none have been built: it would be a VERY heavy boat for its length. I am currently sailing a much simpler, lighter cheaper boat (Michalak Jewel Box Jr.) to see how I like sailing without a cockpit.
