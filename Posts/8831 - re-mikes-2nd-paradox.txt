Mike's 2nd Paradox now lives in my garage.

This past weekend was a marathon road trip, 1,200 miles round trip, including sightseeing. She towed like a dream. Mike, thanks for all the trailer work you did!!!

Yesterday evening, I had a chance to look the little vessel over at a more relaxed pace. Lovely little boat. Stout construction. What I really love is the workboat finish. I won't be afraid to treat her rough, or get creative with paint schemes. Very liberating.

She needs a name. Is there a term of a low maintenance lady? For me, naming a boat is both exciting and grueling; too many choices. I'm looking forward to painting the name on, as opposed to sticking vinyl letters on top of gelcoat. I hate gelcoat. Maybe my gelcoat days are history.

Tag office warned me it could take four months before the state assigns a hull number to a homemade boat. This boat must be lucky, because a trooper came by this morning and issued the HIN. The title work should be completed shortly.

Really looking forward to more road trips with the Paradox, but those will be on the front-end and back-end of sailing adventures. Also looking forward to tinkering in the garage.

I'll let y'all know how the sailing goes.
