Hey Pete,

Glad to see you are so close....wish I was there... must be cool to look out and see a boat..... I look in my closet and see plywood with the shape of bulkheads....WAH!! Soooo slow....still I take comfort in the fact that if I had started 2 yrs ago I would be sailing now.

Hi Nels.

I ended up finding a supply of 4 and 6 oz cloth in the widths I wanted, and they arrived today.
I've probably spoken too soon about getting the boat glassed before the cold. It's down to about 4C tonight and today, although dry and sunny, only got up to 13C.
We'll have to wait and see. I can get on with the cabin top regardless and I have plenty to keep me occupied till the spring!

Pete
