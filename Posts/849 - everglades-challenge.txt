Hi All,
 
I just returned from Ft. Desoto where I was able to sail with Matt on Thur. And a little on Fri. before he pulled Paradox out of the water in prep for the race. He had a very neat set of rollers, actually two, which he used to haul out with. For purchase he used a four-part block and tackle and a six-part block and tackle, which he tied to the four-part. As we werent sure if he could receive assistance during the haul out, he accomplished it all by himself. Matt figured his secret weapon would be that he could sleep while underway and keep going. I just checked the Water Tribe info forum and there is no word of his position posted but mention was made of his helping a fellow competitor.
 
It was a real treat to have two Paradoxes sailing together and was a first for Matt as well. Man can he sail that boat. He windward sailing ability was far superior to mine and later he suggested some alterations I need to make to my sail. He also mentioned that he had heard that Dabbler Sails (www.dabblersails.com) was very good at building these lug sails. I am considering sending them mine for are cut as I havent been pleased with it since first setting but now that I have had a chance to sail in company with Paradox I can see real promise with a well-made one. A real dumb mistake was forgetting my camera so I sorry to report that I didnt get any pictures.
 
Just checked official results on Water Tribe site and Matt had checked in at check point 2 (Placida, FL) at 0930 this morning and was continuing on to Sanibel on the inside. To follow his results go to http://www.watertribe.com/FloridaEverglades/ and look under class four.
