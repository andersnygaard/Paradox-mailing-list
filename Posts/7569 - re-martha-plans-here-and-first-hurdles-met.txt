Subject: [paradoxbuilders] Martha: Plans here and first hurdles met.

So finally the plans have arrived. And in very good time aswell, i barely had time to (sort of, kind of)clear the garage.

Now i am however meating my first hurdles. I will present them and see if anyone can help. I am not completly shure about copyright etc so i will be intentionally vauge wen asking some questions. This is a problem that should not actually be a problem, at least i hope so. I beleve taht anyone that has the plans themselves will be able to fill in the gaps i leave in.

1. PLYWOOD 
Here is  my first problem and it is abot matereal thiknes. it seams taht all the standard thiknes of ply in sweden is often 1mm thicker then US standard. I have encontered this problem before wen building kayaks. The solution then was to just go with the thicker ply. A 4mm thick ply kayak is not to bad compared with a 3mm one. I do not know however if the extra thiknes,and therefore weight, will be to much. I think this will be a non problem in the end and i will probably just go with the thicker ones. I would however apriciate some input. Ither to confirm our discorage.If not my options are ither special order ply,wich is a financial nightmare. Our just planing down 1mm of the boards. I have actually done that with a swall model kayak. Buth that is just a horribble horrible nightmare.

On a lighter note my wife will help me to set up a blog. I have found all the blogs i have read so far very helpfull and informative. Not mentianing any names buth thanks everyone.

Cheers
Christian
