Subject: Re: Why not scale?

I have been a member of this group for a few months, and it seems that there has been a fair bit of discussion on modifiying the Paradox design to increase the size. The designer, Matt, apparently has approved a modest increase in scale.

Some companies and boat designers who make a living designing boats often have similar designs in different sizes to meet different needs. Matt actually considered a couple of different versions of a bit larger Paradox (21' &amp; 23')and provides concept sketches in his disk that comes with his plans. It looks like a lot of thought went into these sketches, as was done for the original Paradox.

Perhaps if he was given enough incentive Matt might take some time from what he is doing to convert the concepts into a plan. Incentive? -- someone offering to pay for a design and someone actually building a prototype. It looks like this has been a practice with designs of Phil Bolger , John Welsford and Jim Michalak.

Maybe someone on this list could contact Matt to see if he would be interested and what the incentive might be, then poll the members to see how many would be interested sharing the costs of getting new plans made. There is a provision on this site to conduct a poll....
