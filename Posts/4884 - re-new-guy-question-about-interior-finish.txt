Welcome, where are you based?

I don't know which is best, but I epoxy coated all woodwork and then painted those bits where the sun would get at it. I now wish I hadn't (painted that is) as I made a terrible job of it and the paint has been peeling off ever since. I applied the paint on the assurance that the sunlight would degrade the epoxy. I am now of the opinion that that was probably Florida sunlight they were talking about. In 4 years the UK sunlight has done no obvious damage to the large areas of exposed epoxy that sit between the small islands of still-adhered paint.

I think the epoxy coating was a good idea as it gives a very hard wearing surface.

Hoping for calm nights
