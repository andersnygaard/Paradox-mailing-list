Hi,

I havent experienced pounding, but she will toss spray, perhaps Matt is trying to reduce that and get a little more speed. definetly no pounding at anchor.

Anyone have any experiences to report with regard to Paradox pounding, either while sailing or at anchor? (I ask because I see that Matt's new design has a slightly different bow design with a 'V' in the bottom and wonder why he decided to do that.)
