Subject: Re: Wood Stove Idea for Paradox

Ignoring the stove for the moment, where are you planning to run the chimney through the hull? If you run it out through the open hatch, you'll get radiant heat but little else, as any heated air will escape upwards, to be replaced by cold air flowing down over your body and pooling around your butt.
