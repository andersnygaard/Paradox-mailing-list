Sails and foils are squares.displacement/volume is cubed and stability 
changes by a factor of 4.What about torsional stresses?Step one;take 
masters course in applied mathematics?Bolger and Michalak both have 
designs in the 20ft-25ft range-would they work with chine runners?
I love "charactorful"objects.I saw a brand new AS29 and thought it was 
one of the most hideous things I'd ever seen.The builder seemed to like 
it though.
