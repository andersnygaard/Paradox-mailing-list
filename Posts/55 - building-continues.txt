Hi All,

I hit a bit of a landmark today, I have finished assembling all of the 
bulkheads.

I set them all up in the correct positions and had a good look at my 
future craft. It was both bigger and smaller than I had imagined. 
Bigger, in that it is going to be a challenge when it is raining to 
work on it with the garage doors shut, and smaller in that it doesn't 
seem possible that everything will fit inside it.

I am going to tidy up and seal the bulkheads and then work on the 
rudder, oar and spars now as I don't think I will be able to do much 
work on the assembled hull until the weather improves in the spring

Still, I'm pretty happy, at least I can pretend it looks like a boat 
now.

Hoping for calm nights

Al
