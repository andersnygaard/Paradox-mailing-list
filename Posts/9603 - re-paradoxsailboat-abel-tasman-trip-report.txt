now I'm facing backwards while underway. Not sure that would work.

Bigger windows on cabin, like a Paradox. Ceiling mounted wide vehicle rear vision mirror! I'm starting to enjoy this arm-chair design exercise, even if it's not really got much to do with a Paradox apart from taking the things I've learned from sailing one and trying to transplant them onto another design.
