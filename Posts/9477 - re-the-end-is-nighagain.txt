Subject: Re: The end is nigh...again!

...which leads me to the next question: Those of you who would like this group to stay active, would you prefer a true email list system much like this one has been, or a web-only system with an archive of these posts and files plus an ongoing forum?

Rob has rightly pointed out that the nature of the community and our engagement in it will be very different if it stops being an email list.

A web-only system can send email notifications, sure, but to actually participate you would have to go and visit the web site.

I would happily host and even create the web side of things. A proper email list server is a very different beast, and I'm not sure I'd tackle that at the moment. I'll look into the options for running one of these and see how difficult it looks.

'woodersonj' and Larry pointed out Groups.io, and I agree that looks like a good option. They have an easy migration path from Yahoo Groups, too.

Interestingly, Groups.io has been created by Mark Fletcher, who wrote the original 'ONElist/eGroups' which Yahoo acquired in early 2000 and renamed to yahoo Groups! Mark created Groups.io because he wanted it done right and felt he had "unfinished business".

There ya go. Sorry I've gone on a bit. More thoughts?

Matt.
