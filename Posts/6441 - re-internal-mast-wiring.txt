There are many alloys of bronze. Sometimes they may be work hardened somewhat during forming in the mill. But in a general way no, heating won't cause weakening or sofening after heating and cooling. Or a very tiny amount, in any case. Steve

Thanks to both, a conduit of some sorts seems like the foolproof way ahead.


On a different subject, does heating bronze rod (to bend it) cause it to become softer and/or weaker?

I'm talking of the furling rod.

I put a nylon tube inside my mast when I glued it shut. It is slippery and hard. I did this so I could easily change the wires someday if needed. It's 1/2 inch dia. I have not used it yet however.

Subject: Internal mast wiring

I'm sure this must be an old question, but as I'm about to add the final side panel to my mast I thought I'd better ask about what others have done about internal cables and, more importantly their entry and exit.
 
I'm going to run a length of RG58 coax for a VHF antenna together with wiring for lights (may put 4 core in just to have a couple of spares!).
Obviously these exit the mast at the top somewhere below the solid top section, and in a location which will not foul the halyard or the yard.
 
At the bottom I can't see any easy way to route the wiring below deck level that won't seriously be a lot of hassle when inserting and removing the mast. I'm inclined to bring the cables out above deck and just bring them inside via the vent trunk. I can't say I've noticed what others have done. I'm also concerned about water ingress through either top or bottom entries. I suppose I'll just have to apply some flexible sealant.
 
What do you think?
