In designing Paradox Matt put in a lot of careful and innovative thinking.

In bending his sculling oar around the curve of the gun'l' he stopped thinking.
The bend is all-important:  it must be in the right place for the boat and the oarsman,  and it must be sharp.
Bob Groves and Slieve McGalliard have put in a lot of research and thought.

I've used a sculling oar on my dinghy for decades:  it's hard,  concentrated work.
A proper yuloh is a revelation.
Alastair very kindly allowed me to play with the oar on his Paradox:  it wasn't intuitive.
