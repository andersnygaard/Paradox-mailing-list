Subject: Bottom Slap
Date: 12 May 2019 12:36:35 +0000


A number of people have mentioned how a sharpie can have annoying bottom slap when sailed (or motored, or towed) flat. I've noticed that some of Matt's more recent designs (Enigma) have gone to a more complex vee-shaped bow -- I'm guessing to reduce slap.

1) Can anyone verify that the purpose of Enigma's vee-shaped bow is to reduce slap, or are there other reasons?

2) Have those of you who have sailed a Paradox wished for less slap, and is the complexity of Enigma's bow worth considering for a Paradox? I assume you would have to use fairly thin plywood to allow for the twist. So then would either have to use multiple layers of plywood to create the bottom durability that Paradox has, or else add extra layers of fiberglass/epoxy.
