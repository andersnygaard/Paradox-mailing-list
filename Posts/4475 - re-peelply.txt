Peelply

Can anyone tell me what "peelply" is and whether or not its available in the U.S.?

It is a fabric that the resin won't stick to. By stretching it over 
the top of your layup while it cures it ensures a smooth finished 
surface and can help compact the layup. When the resin has cured you 
peal off the surface ply, thus peelply.
