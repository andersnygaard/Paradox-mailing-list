Subject: Re: When is marine plywood NOT marine plywood?

Hey Greg,

BS1088 is an excellent standard for plywood. I've used BS1088 rated ply on several boat-building projects and it's held up just fine, especially when coated with epoxy.

There's bad plywood out there. But, in my experience, marine rated plywood is like epoxy in that all its physical properties vastly exceed the requirements of amateur boat-building regardless of brand or price.

If you're wondering if the plywood in that stack that's being offered to you is really BS1088 and isn't just some plywood stamped with the standard, you'll have to trust the seller or their supplier.

Cheers,

John
