Hi John.

In the Poole area you have quite a few small boat builders. Those are the one's to try.
My local one show only sells to me as a favour. Probably just to get rid of me.
I know he would not be interested in mail order as this would only add to the cost.

I don't think PeelPly would work on Gelcoat as it would still leave an imprint of the PeelPly cloth on the outside surface.
What the PeelPly does is cut down on the bulk of the resin and cloth after heavy rolling and give it a smooth outside finish with just a faint imprint of the cloth.
