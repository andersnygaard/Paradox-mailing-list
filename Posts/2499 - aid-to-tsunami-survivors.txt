Subject: Aid To Tsunami Survivors

Hi Folks,

Sorry if this is off-topic, I am sure that many of you have heard about the amount of aid that is pouring into the stricken areas of Asia in the wake of the disasterous tsunami and we are all somewhat overcome by the incomprehiensible amount of death and destruction that changed paradise into hell in a few minutes.

Much of this aid is backing up at major centers because their is no infrastructure in place to deliver it to the survivors. Most, if not all, of the road, airport and seaport faciliteis are destroyed. There are only a few boats that are large enough to carry signifcant cargo and small enough to get into locations that need it.

One of these boats is an 80 foot junk-rigged cargo boat. The owner/captain through an incredible series of circumstances happened to be in Phuket when the tsunami hit and barely managed to escape drowning and save his boat. He now feels it his duty to help as many survivors  as possible and he is requesting assistance. 

Two groups, one in the USA and one in Canada are putting the administrative structure in place to accept donations on a tax exempt basis with 100% of the donations going directly to delivery of aid to survivors of the  islands in the Phuket proximaty, that are presently completely cut off from the rest of the world.

A major requirement is for the installation of a desalinator on board the boat as fresh water is absolutely the first priority to assist survivors. Fortunately the boat has a new engine that can run a desalinator capable of supporting their efforts.

More complete details will be forewarded shortly. This is just to make people aware of this one small effort of a few people who are directly involved with the aid efforts.

Sincerely,
