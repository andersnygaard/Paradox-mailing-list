Use 6061-T6 and you won't havt to. It will be twice as stong as a wooden paradox. Airliners fly at 500 mph with .025 skin. It is the amount of strigers and supports that provide the strenght. You won't need a full bulhead, just a plate with laroge holes punched in it to allow for flex.

You would have to use sheets of metal which are much thinner than plywood so presumably would have to build in much more framing to give the required stiffness.

I don't think anyone has tried to fabricate an aluminum Paradox before; though, one has been made of divinycell foam. Nonetheless, I think it would be a worth while project provided the proper aluminum was employed. It would certainly make a very sturdy vessel!
