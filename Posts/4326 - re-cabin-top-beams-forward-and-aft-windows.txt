Ah well. I have to finish some drawings for a developer by Tuesday so Sunday will be my drawing day.
Take your camera with you on your trip and take plenty of pictures. Pleeeeeeze.
I'll show you mine if you show me yours.
Now where have I heard that before?
Have a fine trip.
 

It is no good me taking my camera, at least not if you want pictures of LJ sailing. The only person who can't see what she looks like is me. However I always have a camera on board.

Hoping for calm nights
