Subject: Re: LED lighting (again)

I bought a set of these lamps by Pifco last year and had similar thoughts. I emailed them and asked them to check the possibility of making an all round white LED lamp for sailors. I don't think they took it seriously because I recieved an amusing reply, but if they do make them I'm claiming credit!
If I hadn't asked about that copper pipe I wonder if it would still be ok? :0)

When I built Little Jim I installed LEDs in all the lockers and remote corners, wired back to a central battery, and i am delighted with the results. However last weekend I found myself wondering why I had bothered. 

I was buying a new set of lights for my push-bike and for 15ukp I became the proud owner of a set of 2 LED lamps. Each lamp is self contained in a reasonably weather proof case about 100mm x 40mm x 20mm. There are 3 LEDs shining out of the largest face. The instructions suggest that the two AAA cells may last for 100 hours. There were a number of clamps to fix to the bike with a quick-release attachment of the lamp.

I was left with the feeling that they could have been designed for a boat tent.

Of course they don't have the ambience of that paraffin hurricane lamp ..........

Hoping for calm nights
