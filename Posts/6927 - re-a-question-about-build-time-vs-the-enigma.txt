I am sure enigma takes less time, but it is a different boat. More importantly, I don't think spec drawings exist for enigma.

i think many would be builders of Paradox are put off by the amount of effort it takes to complete. me for one. so i have been thinking that if i do undertake a build i would use aluminium which is stronger and would, i think, cut down on the time significantly.

I've been reading all I can about the Paradox build and it seems that it's taken most people around 18 to 24 months to complete working some nights and weekends.  I've also been looking at the Enigma 460 and people have completed boats in under half a year and many under a year. Are the construction methods vastly different for these two boats or is it just the lack of shelving and floor framing that makes the Enigma quicker to build.  I like both boats for different reasons but the Paradox is my favorite as it's more suited to cruising.
