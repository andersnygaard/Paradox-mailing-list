Subject: Car topping paradox?

Hi just a thought, 

How about a car topping paradox / enigma, built lighter than a usual paradox, where the cabin sides / roof bolt off from the hull and invert inside the hull for stowage? Thus creating a car topable cruiser weight would need to be kept down say using 1/4 ply for sides and roof etc. 

Just a thought?! 

Yours James
