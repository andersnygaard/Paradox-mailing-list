Subject: Paradox empty weight?
Date: 23 Jan 2015 11:16:09 -0800

Hello All. 

I'll be purchasing a new (for me) Paradox early next month and I'm trying to work out which vehicle I'm going to take on this rather long road trip. My car has a limited towing capacity but would be preferable to drive over my van due to noise, mileage, and potentially snowy roads. 

I'm trying to get an estimate of what a Paradox would weigh all up empty with no water ballast. I'll add the trailer weight, and then see if my car can handle it. My car has a towing capacity of about 1000lbs.

Any advice would be appreciated.
