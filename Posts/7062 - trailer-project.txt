Subject: Trailer project

Hi folks,

I've just added some photos to illustrate how I recently built a new trailer for my Paradox. The intention was to make a trailer which was strong, gave a smooth ride and made launching and recovery easy when on either steep or shallow sloping slipways/ramps.

You'll notice how the bed can be tipped so that the boat runs down the rollers easily. It's possible to launch or recover on even a level dry surface so that I can leave the boat on dry land at low tide or for easy maintenance.

Construction is mostly ordinary steel angle - no hollow sections to hold sea water and rust out easily. Sorry about the bright green paint. It was left over from another project. The axle unit was from an old one ton van and has simple leaf springs and gives a much smoother ride than those rubber in torsion units that are usually used.
