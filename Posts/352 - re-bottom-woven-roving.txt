Subject: Re: Bottom Woven Roving

I would sand the whole thing down to bare glass to begin with and see if everything is well laminated. If there are any loose areas you could grind these away and fair them down with epoxy and cabosil/microballons. Don't forget to wear a dust mask and proper clothes. Fiberglass can make you itchy and it isn't really great for your lungs either. 

Any thoughts Glen?
