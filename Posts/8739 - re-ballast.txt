Thank you, Stephen,

But I take it more as sharing my thoughts, to get others, who are interested, to possibly skip a few steps.

I joined the junkrigassosiation to get help from experienced junk rig users/designers/makers to design one for me; and that is pretty much what has happened in that thread :)
