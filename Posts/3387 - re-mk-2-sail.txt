Subject: Re: Mk 2 sail


I set up my topping lift so that the aft end of the boom is raised slightly, this causes the sail to roll up away from the drum. I felt it was best not to have the luff rolling on top of itself as this would quickly build up a thick roll (due to multiple layers at the seam), leaving more of the peak unrolled when stowed


The position of the sail along the boom (and the yard) can be adjusted to set the balance (by moving the centre of effort backwards and forwards). Took me well into my second season before I was satisfied I had it in the right place.



You need it thinnest at the tack end. I didn't put enough taper on mine and ended up packing some rigid foam round the aft end of the boom instead.

You are bound to have some loose sail left over. When you want to look tidy just tuck it under the boom.
