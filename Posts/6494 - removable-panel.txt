Subject: Removable panel

Hello,

I'm considering building a removable panel at the aft part of the roof, similar to the "little cruiser" design. This would create a less closed-in feeling and make it possible to sit on deck with your feet in the cabin. Can anyone offer any advice on whether this is an easy modification to the original plan? Also, would waterproofing be an issue with this design?

Thank you for sharing your ideas.

Best regards,

Olivier Leo
