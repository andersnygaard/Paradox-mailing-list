You've raised a good point there John about the specifications.  I have noticed that nearly every Paradox has been modified in some way from the original. Whether these changes are deliberate or inadvertent I couldn't say. I remember when I saw Petite Lady in Auckland several years ago, I was surprised to see that the aft part of the chine runners had been cut off. I asked why and was told that she wasn't balanced (I assume she had lee helm). Yet Jim tells us that his boat has excessive weather helm.

Based on these differences, I think I will do a polytarp sail first up and cut it about until Mini is balanced.  Maybe after that I will get a "real" sail.
