It seems that the real smart people who are engineers for this sort of thing  choose 16 and 18 inch dia propellers. Sometimes 3 bladed sometimes 2 bladed. And with a pitch about 1.3 to 1.5 times the diameter. I cannot pretend to understand the science of it though. The problem of how to run the power shaft with u-joints really is a problem. It will need some more thought. Steve Yahn
