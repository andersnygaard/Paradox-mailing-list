Jack, do you have a copy of Gregg Carlson's "hull" program?
If so it has a nesting function that you can use and I have already input the Paradox values into my copy and can forward you the file. With it you can enlarge the values and then output Txt file offsets and play with the nesting of developed panels. The program is freeware.
