Greetings Mark,

A couple of miles from Montauban, in the Tarn-et-Garonne (82).

We exchanged a few messages a while ago on the subject. Since then, I built a Selway-Fisher 50/50 sailing canoe and a Nick Schade Wood Duck kayak, converted for sailing with an add-on rig by Mike Storer. Now it's back to the Paradox. Completing beams, rudder next.

Where are you with your plans to build one? If I recall correctly, you were thinking it over.

Richard
