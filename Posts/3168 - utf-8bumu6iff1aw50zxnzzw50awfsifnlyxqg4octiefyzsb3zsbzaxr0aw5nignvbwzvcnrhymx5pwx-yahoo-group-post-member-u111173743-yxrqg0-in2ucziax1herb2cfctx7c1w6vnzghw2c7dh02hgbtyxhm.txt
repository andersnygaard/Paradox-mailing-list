I use various cushions like thro pillows, as I am constanly changing
seating arangments. I have a few of the marine seat type with straps and
a few similar but overstuffed. I too had contemplated a swinging hammock
type, the only problem that I have found is with a passing powerboat
wake or good sized wave one wants to get the CG of the craft as low as
possible quickly. It would depend greatly on how you intend to use the
boat and where. I have a bosch work radio that is about 16 inches tall
and runs on the batteries it charges and it is set in a aluminum tubular
frame. I use that with a cushion when I am motoring and need a good view.
