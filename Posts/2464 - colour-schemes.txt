Subject: Colour Schemes

I am hoping that some kind souls among you are good at colour and design. I have ordered my paradox sail in red for good visibility at sea. (that is bright red rather than tan) I am not sure about what colour to do the hull. The firm that I have bought my finishing epoxy from have a range of coloured powders that can be mixed into the final coat of resin. Remembering that I live in England (temperate maritime climate) can anybody suggest a good colour scheme, please. All help gratefully received. Thanks ....Derek
