Subject: Re: Cruising on the St-John's

Some thoughts for builders.  I really appreciated the extra width in my boat, in which the plywood of the central bulkhead was replaced with steel (see the Ironsides build).  This permits sleeping on the right side of the boat where there is extra length, and also leaves space on the left for my Brompton bike,

By slightly modifying the access through bulkhead 2 I am able to slip my Brompton through into the "forward stateroom" where it is a permanent fixture until I need it.
