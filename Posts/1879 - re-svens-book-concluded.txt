Subject: Re: Sven's book, concluded

I would think the Swedish market is well served by Sven's book in his native language.  If the idea is to "get the word out" to a North American and British audience than probably a US, Canadian, or UK publisher would be better.

Also, saving money doesn't always save money.  Books cost what they do because of distributors and marketing costs.  These costs are necessary to get a book to the widest possible audience.

If the book gets translated into English I again suggest that we look for a publisher who will also market and distribute it properly.  Sven is entitled to all the royalties and he will benefit the most from this solution- if he wants to go this route.
