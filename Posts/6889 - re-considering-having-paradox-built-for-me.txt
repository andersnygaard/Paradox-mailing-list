Subject: Re: Considering Having Paradox Built for Me.

The hatch would not be fully watertight under pressure. The design ensures that any water coming down onto, or over, the hatch in normal use will not get in.

I have suffered a 90 degree knock-down, through my own inexperience, and, even though I had the hatch open enough to let a webbing strap through, only about a couple of litres of water came in. The most annoying thing was that I got my sleeve wet!.

I have carried out some capsize tests <http://youtu.be/t9zFRR3M2M0> and am confident that, in the case of a capsize and assuming the hatch was shut, the boat would not remain upside down for long enough for a significant amount of water to come in.

I have wondered about the mast myself, though it does not appear to affect the sailing, and have come up with 2 possible explanations:-

1/ It makes it much easier to access the forward storage area.

2/ The boom must be high enough to clear the skippers head, but cannot be too high as this would raise the centre of effort. Having decided the height of the boom, this fixes the length of the tack strut. For the boom to fold down neatly along the side deck the foot of the tack strut must be located off centre.

It is worth noting that the height/shape of the cabin is also impacted by the boom stowage, and the mast height is limited by the requirement to stow it inside the hull.
