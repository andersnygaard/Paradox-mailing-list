Jim, thanks for the education on woven roving vs biaxial. Lots to learn.

I just remembered something. I made mention of Chopped Strand Mat. It doesn't like epoxy and should only be used with polyester or vinylester resin. Polyester is no good with ply as it is water permeable over a time and the water gets under it and causes delamination. Vinylester is watertight like epoxy so is ok for sheathing but as it doesn't stick as well as epoxy does to wood isn't recomended for glueing structural joints.

Happy gooping!
Jim
