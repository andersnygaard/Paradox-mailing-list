Subject: Re: Chine Log shape

I seem to remember that the bevel is about right at the ends but not, as you say, at the middle.

After the chine logs are in they, and the bulkheads, need to be faired so that the bottom fits. It is easier to do it then than to try and assemble it with the bevels right all the way along

Some builders like to get all the bits the correct shape and then put them together when they hope they fit perfectly. This design follows the approach that at each stage of the construction the bits are assembled to what you have already made (whether it is exactly right or not) and then there is a guarantee that they *will* fit. Just go with the flow and it will all work out.

Subject: [paradoxbuilders] Chine Log shape

One thing that has puzzled me on the plans is the shape of the Chine Log shown on the bottom of sheet 5. I see the sheer clamp above it, looks like it will tuck in to the top right corner of bulkhead 3 shown on the same page just to the left of it. Why is the shape of the chine log as shown not flat on the bottom? Even if it is rotated 90 degrees to the right and it is supposed to tuck into the left corner, the flare of the sides is not near 16 degrees, only a few. Am I looking at this wrong?

Thanks again,
Paul
