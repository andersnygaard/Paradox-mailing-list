Subject: Re: Got my plans today

Hi DC. Thanks for the link. The el Toro design is basically a pram style dinghy, is it not? The place where I'll be taking sailing lessons uses that style of boat.

Don't get me wrong, I love Manitoba in the summer and fall. First half of winter is good too. After a while, I just tend to get sick of -35c. Spring is a much needed break. And it's taking its sweet old time getting here this year.

Cheers, Alf
