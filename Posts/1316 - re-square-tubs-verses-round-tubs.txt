Glen "What you personally don't like and what works are two different things. What the homebuilder needs is less of your kind of stuff, and something he can use, practically, without exposing himself to dangerous chemicals. Is this my personal opinion, no, it my advice to boatbuilders. Don

Note:
Never, ever, use vinegar to clean your skin, and wear gloves when
using it. Work CLEAN. If you take precautions epoxy should not get on
your skin in the first place, if it does follow the epoxy manufactures
advice for removing it. Work sensibly and you should never have a
problem of any kind.

Hoping for calm nights
