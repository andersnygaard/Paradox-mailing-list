Hello Deric,

One option to protect the leading edge of the rudder is to glue some rope in the leading edge with epoxy. It will act as a sacrificial edge and can always be ground off and replaced. 

Hope this helps,
Chris

Hello Fellow Paradoxians;

I am interested to ideas from others on protecting the leading edge of the rudder. Too often it become the default depth finder.

Please share any ideas you have or taken to militate against damage to the leading edge of the rudder usually caused by hitting rocks, or other hidden objects.

Much obliged,
Deric
