Hello everyone and welcome. As the interest in the Paradox grows I thought it might be nice to have a site for the exchange of information on the building and sailing of this fine little cruiser.

At present I know of only two models sailing and those are Matt's and Don Elliot's. If any of you have completed and are now sailing yours please send notification as I would like to start a file of completed boats as well as a file of boat builders so that new members can go there and view who's done and who's a building.


As for myself I am almost finished and hope to get "Zo=EB" wet by the end of the month. As a professional boat builder I have found the building of a Paradox to be both challenging and rewarding. There are some tricky details to attend to and it is hoped that with the help of this group all those whose choose to start will complete their projects.

One of the first things I would like to recommend to those considering this undertaking is to contact Don Elliott at: delliott@tomah.com and request a copy of his articles on "Building the Paradox" they are very reasonably priced and you will find them invaluable. As an example I wish I had a copy when I built the coach roof for "Zo=EB" his jig makes this task easy.

Let's get to building! 
Glen
