Thanks for the Yuloh advice
Twist push , twist pull
I'll use it as a mantra when next I sail, well done..

Made lead ballast weights today, long and thin to sit either side of the boat against the inside of the chine, as far out and as far down as possible for balance, and well out of the way of the storage areas.

Rigging the sail tomorrow, made all the rope ends tonight, each rope is sewn over at each end, it stops fraying and looks all so nautical.
