Subject: Re: Boom drilling


I drilled mine by eye. It came out a little crooked. I use it the way it is. Works well. It isn't a fussy thing, I supose. Good luck in all you do. Steve

Hi all,
I'm in the process of building a Paradox sail rig, and I'm wondering if somebody might be up for sharing best strategies for drilling the hole in the tack end of the boom, for the piece of copper pipe. I'm concerned about having to make such a long hole, and making sure that it comes out straight. Any thoughts to share? I've tried searching the past messages, but no luck.
Thanks ever so much,
Shemaya
