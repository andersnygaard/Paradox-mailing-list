Hi Derek,

I have a design like that in my portfolio and it will comfortably carry 220 lbs. along with the boat weight of 30 lbs. while drawing only 4". The midship measurement is 9" in height. It takes an additional 85 lbs. to sink her another inch.

I wouldn't hesitate to paddle that canoe on a quiet pond or lake at the lighter, 220 lb., loading. If yours is even deeper than the 9", then just go for it if the price is right. You can carry it to the water with one hand.

Chris
