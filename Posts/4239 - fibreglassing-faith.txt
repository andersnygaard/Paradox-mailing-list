Subject: Fibreglassing 'Faith'

It's been a brilliant week for boatbuilding. I've been able to fully encapsulate the hull with woven roving and epoxy. I need to smooth the surface before painting.

How do people finish their fibreglass sheathing? With my previous boats I've used plastic padding to good effect. It's so easy to sand, enabling a good finish.

Bill.
