Good to hear you are having a good time with "Whisper" David. A good read and a solution to jet skies can be found in Jimmy Buffet's " Where is Joe Merchant". I have found that tacking "Zoe in light airs is sometimes frustrating and requires backwinding the main (have you tried backing "Whisper" up by backing the main yet?). The only trouble I have had when the wind is blowing is if I have been pinching, the Paradox does not like to be sailed too close to the wind, if you will fall off a little to get up boat speed before tacking I think you will find that she comes around just fine. This is a real problem if there is any chop or sea running as it tends to really slow her down. If you find yourself in irons just backwind the main and go in reverse until she is on the right tack, this is a slow maneuver but might save you from going ashore if you cut it too close as I often do.
