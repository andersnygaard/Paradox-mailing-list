Subject: Re: replacing wood spars for aluminum

Hello Pete,

thanks for the reply.
I'm aware that the sail will not completely furl flawlessly without a boom taper.
When the sail needs to be furled that much it's probably too windy to sail anyhow so that's not a problem for me,I will tack away the last foot of triangle cloth with bungee cord.
I'm not exactly sure what you mean by boom droop but the alu spar with it's 3 mm wall is plenty stiff and strong,probably much stiffer and stronger...and heavier than the wooden Paradox boom.
I have no idea if Paradox needs boom flexibility to get proper sail setting but it probably helps when gusting.
Notice that I'm using the (reduced area)sail not on a Paradox but on a homebuilt thub.
The boat is still in the workshop so I can't raise the mast and try the furling system yet.The boom turns freely like if it was on ball bearings so at least that's a good start...I think.
