Subject: Re: Mast is offset?

Phil...I'll tell you what I know but I don't know all the answers.

Yes, the mast is offset left. I suspect that the reason for this is that it allows there to be an unimpeded opening in the forward cabin bulkhead to give decent access to the forward section of the boat. I don't know that is the reason for a fact....but if the mast was on center that would not be possible....or at least not nearly as convenient.

Why is the sail set to the port side of the mast? Might have to do with the fact that having it towards one side allows the whole rig to pivot to the side, over the left side of the cabin and lay on the side deck? Maybe, maybe not? Don't know for sure...someone else will have to answer that one.
