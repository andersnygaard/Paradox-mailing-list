Hi Ned,

I think you are trying to find problems where there are none:-)

Paradox is the apex of a series of designs by Matt over many years and
includes a host of refinements. Before considering any modifications
it would be best to consult with him first.

You might also join the smallboats group where the moderator is
building a Paradox. He is quite an experieced boater over about 30
years or more and loves the Paradox as it is designed.
