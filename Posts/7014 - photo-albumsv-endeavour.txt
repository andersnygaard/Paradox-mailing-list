Subject: PHOTO ALBUM....s/v ENDEAVOUR

Hello All...

As promised I have posted a new album containing 10 photos of the progress thus far on ENDEAVOUR. Hope you all enjoy them and find the changes that I made both satisfactory and becoming of the PARADOX family. Most notably would be the pictures of the almost completed cabin top. I decided to go with port hole style windows and a one piece "lift out" hatch as opposed to the sliding hatch. These are exciting days in ENDEAVOUR'S work shop as she is really starting towards becoming the sailing vessel trapped inside all that plywood and lumber! Special thanks to my uncle Mr. William Johnston for all his help today in getting these pictures up and running. More soon to follow....

Safe Passages To All,
Greg Lockhart
