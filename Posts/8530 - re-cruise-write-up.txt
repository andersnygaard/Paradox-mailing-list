My wife said 'Why don't you soak the chine logs in wet towels for a few hours (she can be clever like that)?'  I tried her idea with my sheer clamp replacement and it went in like a charm.

Not sure that is going to work with the chine logs, but all your ideas are food for thought, thank you.  I'll see how I get on.

Cheers,

Rob.
