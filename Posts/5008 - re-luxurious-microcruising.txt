Good advice Jim, I almost killed myself by inhaling carbon monoxide a few years back. If it hadn't been for my wife I would have been a goner.

By the time I knew what was going on It was to late.

Yes it was a close one, don't take chances with possible exposure, if it happens while your asleep you will not wake up!

Hi All, John

Just be very careful. Heat diffusers can be carbon monoxide generators and even with Paradox's excellent ventilation you don't need too much to have serious health problems. The worst thing about them is they are not immediately obvious, just slowly feeling lethargic, achey, often taken to be a flu coming on.

Enjoy
