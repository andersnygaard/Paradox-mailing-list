Subject: west coast USA paradox for sale

Hello,

I wanted to share a link to a Paradox sailboat for sale on the West coast of the USA. It's not mine and unfortunately, it's on the wrong coast for me. However, I believe this was sold in 2020 when I looked at the Paradox group on Facebook.

Here is the link: https://humboldt.craigslist.org/boa/d/cutten-paradox-14-micro-cruiser/7398150371.html

Thank you!
