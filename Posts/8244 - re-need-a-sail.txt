Subject: Re: Need a Sail

My original sail (Mk1) was never very good as that sail-maker didn't take into account the bending of the yard under load. However I bodged it and used it for 12 years and it got me where I wanted to go most of the time.

I got a new Mk2 sail this year and it looks like it has a much better shape. My first impressions are that there is a greater heeling moment and the sail should be reefed earlier (the Mk1 felt comfortable with full sail well into an F5, the new sail wants reefing at the bottom of an F4).

It is difficult to tell, at the moment, as I have yet to get out in a nice steady F3 where I can compare my performance with my friends' boats. So far, I have generally had F5-6 blustery. I think if I were having to get a new sail now, I would opt for a well-cut Mk1.
