Subject: WaterTribe Challenge

"The purpose of the WaterTribe Challenge is to encourage the 
development of boats, techniques, skills, equipment, and fitness for 
safe and efficient coastal expeditions and wilderness tripping using 
minimal impact human and wind powered watercraft based on kayaks, 
canoes, and small multihulls." Steve Isaac aka "Chief"

In 2004 Florida Challenge he used a small kayak he built called a Rob 
Royoid, so he could "enjoy" the inland sections through the Everglades 
swamps.
