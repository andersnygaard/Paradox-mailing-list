Subject: Vane Gear and Anchoring

Happy to report that Raffles' vane gear is completed. Took five times as long as expected but what's new. Now comes the more challenging task of mounting it to the back of the boat - particularly with an outboard mount in the way. 

Question to Glen if you're reading this: How did you overcome the problem of having to lean so far out to make the necessary setting adjustments? I can see myself taking an unplanned swim considering how far out the vane needs to be mounted to clear the end of the boom. I am considering a mount that will allow me to bring the vane in for adjustment.

Anyone else putting a vane on their Paradox? Also, I am planning some sailing that will require anchoring using a fair amount of chain. Do any of you Paradox sailors have any experience storing and dragging chain through the boat? I am considering adding a chain pipe that would be sealed when underway. Any thoughts?

Cheers,

Mark
