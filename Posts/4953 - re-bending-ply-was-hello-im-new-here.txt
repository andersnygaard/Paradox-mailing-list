Alan,

yes I may resort to the steamer this weekend, as I did for the chine logs.

The area in question is only about 400mm long and about the same width, right up at the stem. I should have left a substantial overhang which would have made the whole process so much easier.

I could leave the sheet on a damp lawn (more likely wet lawn), but as for the sun, well we can only hope!
