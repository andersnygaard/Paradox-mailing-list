That's a good question.  I'm in the UK and I asked Rob at Epoxy Resins how much I would need. I gave him the area to fill, but he said it depends on the weave of the roven woving and the sort of finish required; therefore he could not, or would not hazard a guess.

Mine came in a bucket labelled 0.3kg. I still have some left.

Thanks. That's very helpful - it sure goes a long way.

Bill.
