Jeff, 

I know its hard, but once I heel this baby over those "spray" rails as you call them will magicly transform into "chinerunners"  but I have not put the mast on, just hull&amp;power so far and the numbers look good. Ive also overcome the window dilemma, I feel these should serve just a bit better. also I feel the overall design could be made better. I know I know, it looks as if its the last word, but it isnt. still working it out. also looking into a periscope mast version.

Jack
