Subject: Re: Matt Layden In His Latest Design Currently Leading the UFC

There was a famous (in Australia anyway) chap called Cliff Young who, aged 61, won the 500+ mile Sydney to Melbourne running race. He was a farmer and famous for running in overalls and gumboots. He was victorious against professional athletes decades his junior. His secret was minimal sleep.
