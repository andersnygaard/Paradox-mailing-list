I don't know whether anyone has tried it on Paradox, but here is the
system Chris Morejohn and I came up with for his 32-foot sharpie
Hogfish. Weighing down the rudder blade doesn't work, for a couple of
reasons. For one, the force is in the wrong direction. To get a
balanced helm the rudder blade has to pivot slightly forward, and you
can't do that with gravity. 

As the weight on the Paradox blade is at the rear edge it does cause 
the blade to go beyond the vertical. It can't go too far as it then 
fouls on the bottom of the transom. 

For another, when the boat is
charlie-horsing in chop, the weighted rudder blade builds up angular
momentum on the upswing, causing it to jump up. This makes for an
absolutely unmanageable helm.

Remember, on the Paradox, the rudder forms part of the lateral 
resistance. With the blade fastened to the side of the stock, as soon 
as the blade is loaded, the friction is such that the blade would be 
very unlikely to move unless it hits something. I have certainly 
never noticed this effect.
