Jack, thanks for the reply.

I wasn't successful at finding your photo's or files regarding the swivel rod. Its the folder called Jacks tack strope, If I remember I had sent the pics to someone showing how I got around that, they posted it in their album, the other setup in, A version of the Roller Reefing, is very nice.

I did see some Jill Baby photos. Congratulations!! What's she upto nowadays? Have you been pleased with her?

Yes, very pleased!  nothing like the feeling you get being out on the water in something that you built.   I loved the building process. I really got to understand alot of the "thinking" behind the design as I spend time on the water in it. Being winter here in new england, shes sitting on her trailer waiting for the season. I didnt get out last season, had surgery and that left one side out of order for a few months, but thats all fixed and hope to get out this year.

Jack
