I have been studying the plans trying to work out what is supposed to happen where the sheer strakes and chine logs join the stem.

The chine logs look as if they are just cut off at an angle to match a similar cut across the corner of the stem.

The sheer strake is less clear. Has anyone got an opinion as to what is happening, and why the ends don't just butt up to the stem as they do to the transom (or have I mis-read that as well?)

Hoping for calm nights
