Subject: Sailrite kits

I want to give notice that I put in a sailplan at the Sailrite Website. If you go to the sailplans for Paradox there will open up two choices for this sail. My version is as per the plan on Dwg.1. The other fellow made a mistake in putting in the wrong dimension for the "clew to throat" dimension. I hope no one here has an ugly surprise on this account.
