On the topic of stability I think safety in general needs some air time too.
I see in various posts people talk of harnesses and life jackets in their boats.
I wonder what Paradox sailors have to say on safety at sea.
Perhaps it's a worthwhile thread?

I have a life jacket on the whole time at sea, the collar of the jacket is large and while it's designed to keep my head above water if I'm unconscious, its everyday use is as a pillow, it's comfortable and so no bother at all.
I'm tied in rough weather to a point inside the boat, and off shore I have a floating rope trailing behind.
It's water ski rope, bright yellow and it stays on the surface, its drag is very very small.

I have to, by law, carry a survival beacon on the boat.
I have a second one sewn into my jacket. It is small and unobtrusive. It seems to be illegal with just the one on my jacket, the requirement for " the boat " to hold a beacon is firm.

I've read books on gaff rigged boats and in one they say an old adage in a gaff rig was, in bad weather ", to reef hard and reef early ". I leave port with less than full sail each trip where it's windy, or gusty.

What other gems are out there for us to share?
