Searched the posts for comments about sailing and camping Paradox
with 2 adults on board, but could not find reference to that.

Is that doable and safe ? Should I think about building her 10%
bigger to come close to Little Cruiser specs ?

The boat, as standard, sails perfectly happily with 2 on board.

I believe Matt cruised Paradox in the Bahamas for a couple of weeks 
with his girl friend (now his wife).

Ironsides was so called because bulkhead No3 was slimmed down and 
reinforced with metal to widen the sleeping area so 2 sleepers could 
be accommodated.

If you have a satisfactory solution to the sleeping problem you are 
still stuck with the fact that only one person can use the seat while 
sailing, meaning the other is stuck down below. My solution to this 
would be to replace the cabin roof completely with a fabric cover and 
fit a second seat, across the cabin at bulkhead 3.

This would, in theory, reduce the ultimate safety a bit, but I doubt 
if it would be significant. Has anyone, other than me, had their 
Paradox over so far that water would have come in the hatch?
