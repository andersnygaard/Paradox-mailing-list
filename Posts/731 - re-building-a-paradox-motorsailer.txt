I am a real chicken when it comes to sailing on big waters.  I will be looking for a bay or sheltered area, and I will use the boat on Lake Michigan until it is proven and I am ready.  I am not sure if the QC authorities will even allow recreational boating up there without a guide.  I've heard there is no fishing allowed north of the 52nd parallel without a guide.
