Would anyone be interested in a plywood CNC cut paradox boat kit? Vote for one or more options.

  o Not interested in building I just like looking at plans. 
  o No, I prefer to make every piece from scratch. 
  o Yes I would be interested in a kit if priced right. 
  o Yes, I would be interested in a deluxe kit with hardware and epoxy. If priced right. 
  o Yes, and I would be interested in helping design/cut the project. 
  o Stop making polls it is annoying. 
  o No, I can get everything cheaper if I source it myself. 
  o Really, just stop it. 
  o I just want someone else to build the d*** boat for me.
