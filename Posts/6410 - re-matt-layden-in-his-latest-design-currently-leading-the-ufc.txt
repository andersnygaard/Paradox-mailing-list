On the first couple of days, whilst on the outside we were seeing consistent 4.5- 4.8 knots reported from his SPOT, with several of 5+.
Don't know how much of this was tide derived. Check out the mapper near Venice and south of Marco. There's also some fast times after Key Largo and across Biscayne. I remember seeing 5.6 kts on a few occasions. 

Some videos of him paddling here:
