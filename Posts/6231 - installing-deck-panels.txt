Subject: installing deck panels

Ok... heh.. its dumb question time. Sorry guys (and gals). 

I have assumed that the deck panels were nailed to the tops of the deck beams as well as epoxied. Is this correct? I have looked over all the photos I can find and I see none with nail heads on the deck where the beams would be located. Nor does it look like any fairing compound was applied to cover them. 

I am very much a novice woodworker and have had a problem trying to figure out which size nails to use and where to use them. It was easier to work out earlier in the build as alot of the placement was obvious. (bulkheads,etc.) I don't want to screw the deck up, so before I nailed, I thought I ought to make sure. 

The build is going well and I hope to have pics up soon. I have found it was easier than I thought to build this boat while living in a confined space. Once I got started it kinda worked itself out, it has taken much longer than anticipated. (good things come to those who wait) 

Thanx for any help given here,
Rod
