Al,

That article was a copy of my account in the DCA magazine.  I didn't
expect to find it in MAIB, but it was good publicity for promoting
interest in Paradox and the DCA.  There's a jolly good photo of you
and 'Little Jim' at Porthloo beach and another of both Paradoxes at
the same beach.  There's a good photo of you at Exmouth when you
called over to meet me.

Bill.

Don't worry Bill, I wasn't serious.

Well done for spreading the word.

Hoping for calm nights
