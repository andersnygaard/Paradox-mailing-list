I am trying to design a trailerable boat for the Great Lakes. I looked at Paradox, but was concerned that the chine keel would trip the boat in steep breaking waves. Paradox should be able to recover, though. Self-righting capabilities are the most important characteristic of the offshore boat. After that, in my opinion, full flotation, which very few offshore boats have!  

I chose a dory hull, which will heel a lot more than Paradox, but I feel that in the worst conditions it will ride better. Bill Serjant seems to think I should go with a hull that is a bit flatter than the Alpha-Beachcomber variant that I have drawn up. I have heard that BRIS has a flat bottom, but have never seen a picture of her hull shape. Any chance of getting some scans from Sven's book?

Take a look at my design pages at: http://cruisenews.net/whaleback/

I am right at the point of building a chine height model to develop the hull panel shapes.
