You must not be familiar with hardware bonding Nels, it is far superior ,imo, then thru bolting. Check with the WEST people on the technique, after seeing boats lifted with pad-eyes or u-bolts which were only hardware bonded I became a believer. If you want to test it yourself drill a 1/2 inch hole about 1 inch deep into some 2x stock, fill the hole with hi density epoxy mixture and after it cures drill a 3/16 inch hole in the center, dip a 1/4 inch ss machine fastening in epoxy and drive it into the hole and let cure. Now try to pull the fastener out in tension, be sure to pull until you destroy the sample or are convinced of the strength. You will be amazed at the holding power and moisture can't get to the surrounding wood to ever cause a problem.
You can move around inside and effect some trim change but keep in mind that Paradox is small but has a 1400 lb displacement. In my case the inside ballast is in 30 to 40 pound ingots and I don't move it around while sailing as it is secured in place.
