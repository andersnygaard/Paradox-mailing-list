Hi,

You could make a pattern out of a hard wood that has the curve your looking for and beat the sheet metal around it, depending on thickness, you may have to apply heat to make the metal bend. depending on the thickness of the metal, if your using thick stuff you could grind the shape needed. are you laying the sheet over the bottom? or are you using just sheet for the bottom? anyway very interesting that you are using sheet metal for the bottom. as far as the hydrodynamic function I do not know, but I remmeber a quote from Matt saying that the outward dimension is more important than the shape of the chine runners
