Thank You Al. I was undecided about splitting the floor hatches ahead of the "Seat." Now I will. As usual, you are right about improvements. Most can be changed later. My Wife told me she refused to drink water which has been stored in an Epoxy lined tank. When she said this I realized, vaguely, I didn't feel good about it either. So It's out too. The underfloor locker at the vent trunk is a puzzle though. When I went to five different tire stores to beg for lead ballast they all wanted to charge me the retail price of about .45 cents per pound! So I may use scrap steel plate from Boeing surplus. Much cheeper. The foot drag is variable in it's power so it may be best.
