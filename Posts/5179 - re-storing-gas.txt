Subject: Re: Storing gas

I considered mounting my Honda 2.3 on the starboard side of 'Faith', but came to the conclusion that it was impracticable because of the vulnerability of the engine - especially because of submersion when the boat heels or when motor-sailing.

The sponson concept brings the problem of storage when it is not being used. Where would it be stored? If it became a permanent feature it would adversly affect the sailing performance.

I concluded the only place for the Honda was on the transom, where it is protected from being swamped - even in quite boisterous conditions. In practice it works well there, with the odd exception when the mainsheet fouls the motor - only when it is lifted to its highest position, with the shaft being almost horizontal. Leaving the motor down when sailing does not appreciably affect the speed of the boat, and in that position the mainsheet runs clear. My mounting bracket has 3 positions: high, medium and low; in the high position with the engine vertical, only the tip of the skeg touches the water, which means there is no appreciable drag. In that position it is free of fouling by the sheet.

Regarding petrol storage, I have not found a problem with keeping 2 x 5 litre cans at the forward end of the cabin. I always take precautions not to use the cooking stove when the engine is being re-fuelled.

I hope you will find this useful.

Bill.
