Subject: Re: Chine Runners

I would be very surprised if chine runners would be all that effective on a PDR, or even for that matter a Robbsboat. Matt has written an article about them for "Small Boat Advisor" and it was posted on Sven's website but seems to have been deleted now.

From what I recall, they require a relatively heavy displacement hull with a fair amount of rocker amidships in a hull design that creates some lift by itself. Meaning it has a flat bottom will little flare on the topsides. So the hull itself aids in preventing leeway and the chine runners act as end-plates to provide even more resistance to leeway.

If one is considering a light, easy to transport design, those characteristics are counter intuitive in my view. A leeboard or centerboard are the most effective options, which I am quite certain both Matt and Michalak are well aware of.

It was Phil Bolger who first demonstrated the effectiveness of end-plates on shallow rudders. They prevent the water flow off the rudder from passing downward and make the rudder more effective, by resisting that flow. He felt it would also work on the bottom of a shallow keel, but would be subjected to damage when grounding or loading onto a trailer. A "wing keel" also works but was banned in the America's cup.

A centerboard with an adjustable wing on the bottom that stays parallel to water flow as it is raised would be ideal, but the mechanisms to make that happen without jamming up if grounding with it down have been a challenge for designers.
