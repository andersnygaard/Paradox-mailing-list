Al,

See, that is what happens when I assume...you are, Scot, sorry.

I understand completly and agree that your supposition is correct.
I know you are correct from an empirical basis. That is to say that I
find a way to do everything wrong at least once.
Yours is an ethical theory.

I am not suggesting you actually do it, it was just a thought 
experiment to demonstrate that without the support from the strut the reefed rig would be unusable. In Matt's original design, and my 
(independent) simplification the joint collapses sideways in 
compression and does not give that support.

Hoping for calm nights

Al,
Yeovil, England.
