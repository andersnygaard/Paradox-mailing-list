Ernie,

Actually I bought Whisper and fixed her up. I am building one Though, This is my fist boat and I have very little building experience. I have sleep aboard Whisper many times and think the modification were talking about would be a simple one, as for raising the cabin top, I don't know. Maybe another member could shed some light on this matter?
