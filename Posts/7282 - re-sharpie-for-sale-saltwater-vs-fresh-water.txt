Subject: Re: Sharpie for sale... saltwater vs. fresh water

What Chris Morejohn who built Hogfish told me is that I should not leave Hogfish in fresh water for long periods of time and should not let fresh water sit in the bilge, because that would, over the long term, "kill it." Other than that, there is no limit to how long the hull will last. During the last haulout I made some alterations that required cutting into the plywood structure below the waterline, and I verified that the plywood is in good shape, not too wet, not rotting, and, yes, salty.

This boat is 25 years old, most of which it spent either bathing in salt water or drying out on the hard. It's a salty hull that won't rot. Putting it in fresh water would eventually cause that salt to wash out. As in, over another 25 years of continuous service.

So, this is of no concern to Paradox builders/owners. Just build your boat anywhich way and go sailing. Be sure to use exterior AC plywood and fill the voids. Roll on some house paint and go sailing. It will be strong enough to hold together until you get tired of it. Overthinking takes the fun out of it.
