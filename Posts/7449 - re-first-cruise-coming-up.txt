I did two two-weeks cruises along the East Coast, so here are my comments to your questions from my experience:

How can I get in trouble? Worst case scenarios?
Well, books are written about the danger of solo sailing. The "human factor" is typically the source of the worst errors. Get good rest.
The collision with larger vessel is probably up there on the worst case scenarios list. Parardox is very small compared to the other boats out there, I have good running lights (mounted on the mast) and whenever possible I avoid sailing in the dark. Fog is another great danger (have a horn). I am not sure how well Paradox is seen on the radars.

Suggestions on how to anchor for sleeping?
In ~60% of the time, I can find a small creek or a protected cove where I can either beach the boat or secure it to the shore. Otherwise, I use 13lbs Danforth with 6 ft of chain (I also carry a spare anchor and rod). It worked great on mud. I realize it's an overkill, but I like a piece of mind and a good night sleep.

Essential safety gear to carry, other than my SPOT and VHS radio?
SPOT is a great thing to have, so your loved ones know about your locations, but I do not think SPOT works good as a safety gear. I carry personal Beacon (never used it), two hand-held VHS (one backup), cell phone w/charger. Make sure you have enough buoyancy, so the boat will stay afloat in case it is flooded (have a pump as well). I fitted two large dry bags in the front compartment to store sleeping gear and cloth. Good drysuit (if you can afford one). Life west, safety harness and a leash long enough, say 20 ft or so.

What to expect during my first moments aboard?
Greatest memories that always be with you.
