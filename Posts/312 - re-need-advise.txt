I'm sure you are right about the boat sitting up for awhile, unfortunately most do and most do so out side in the elements. If you didn't find any then your in great shape. you might want to check out Dave Carnell's site at http://home.att.net/~DaveCarnell/rot.html. Using his formula for treating rot fungus should keep it from reappearing. if there ever was any. Before pulling out the foam, you should be able to probe thru it.

I have a thought, perhaps we could get together for a week end cruise, say in Apalachicola Bay. It is a wonderful place to camp and sail. There are camp grounds on St George Island. There I could go over your boat and offer suggestions and you could inspect mine for ideas and we could get some sailing in as well. I might also add that if we could do a "get together" such as this other members of the group could come down as well and get a chance to sail in our boats. I'm open to locations, just happen to know of Apalachicola Bay. Maybe you know of somber where more half way.
