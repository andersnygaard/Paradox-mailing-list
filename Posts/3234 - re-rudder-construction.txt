Hi Alan,

If you look at the pictures of the "JillBaby" in the photo section, you will see her in some strong winds for the photo session Paul Raymond and I did. Basicly I took off north of the meeting point and flew!! to Paul a few miles down the river/bay I landed on the windward side on the sandy beach and decided not to even attempt to return. So I got my truck and attempted to pull her out, I got stuck and took the rudder blade off and used it as a "bridge" for the driving rear tire that was stuck in the sand, all it took were a few small sand scratches. I have since mounted a motor and motor sail alot, often really pushing the boat, more so than just sailing, and have not noticed any damaging wear, Silicon bronze washers bolt and nut.I was very lucky a guy in a Jeep woggoneer was watching the whole thing and pulled my toyota out. He's a local tug captain and asked what the hell is wrong with me. I think somebody may have kevlar'd his leading edge, thats where the damage happens if you drag it over rocks.
