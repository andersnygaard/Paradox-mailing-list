Subject: At Cobnor aboard 'Faith', my Paradox

When cruising aboard my recent boats I have uploaded daily logs to http://bills-log.blogspot.com/

Recently, when at Cobnor for a week with the Dinghy Cruising Association, I did not do the write ups, because of the expense of using my laptop computer Vodafone card.

Since my return home I've posted 5 of the daily logs through my usual Internet provider at no extra expense, and hopefully, I'll upload the remaining ones soon.

I hope you will enjoy reading them, as I've had fun writing them.

Bill.
