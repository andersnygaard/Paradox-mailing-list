Subject: Re: [paradoxsailboat] Build or buy

Hello paradoxians,

I too entertained the idea of adding an outboard to the dox.
In my opinion, such a decision is to be weighted thoroughly.
The intent of the paradox design is to be effective with simplicity. There are advantages of a motor and for me there are more disadvantages.

Advantage;
More power for going against current
Can get moving without wind
Can increase likely hood of staying on a schedule
Could be more pros..????

Disadvantages;
More things to break
Can get snagged in line
Distribution of weight considerations
Extra expense
Possible registration of boat required depending on the regs
Fuel ??

I just wanted to throw it out there for folks to consider. I'm not advocating a position on the matter. A boat and what an owner does to their boat is a personal matter.
Others may feel free to add pros and cons for consideration.

Sail on paradoxians

   Just an idea,Since we are talking low tech, low power. How=E2=80=99s about rigging a small dismountable electric motor or the rudder? This would give the added advantage of better control in tight spots.I have seen small 12v submersible Motor=E2=80=99s for canoes etc.Hmmm! Food for thought?

There is an example in Photo Albums-Whisper, I'm thinking to do the same possibly Electric with some reinforcement in the transom.

I drove from the East Coast of Canada to the West Coast of the United States to get mine- and I am still convinced it was easily worth the 5 grand I paid plus the 12000 km trip!
