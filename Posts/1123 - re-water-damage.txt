Thanks Larry, I have treated it with a Boric acid and anti freeze mixture a few months ago. It seems to be good and dry. Do you think epoxy coating will hurt any thing ?

David,

You might want to coat the suspect areas (or the whole boat) with automotive antifreeze to kill any rot spores. Let that dry and then Epoxy coat. Epoxy is also a good funcicide, I have been led to believe.
