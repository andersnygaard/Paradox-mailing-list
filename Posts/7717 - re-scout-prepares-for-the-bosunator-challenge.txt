The piece of rubber hose I glued into the hole so that it sticks out half an inch really gives that extra security that the yuloh definitely won't fall out of its socket. Since the rubber is flexible, it bends back and forth a little as the yuloh is used. I will report later on its durability, but I think it will last a long time before having to be replaced.
