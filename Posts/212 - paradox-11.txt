I have decided to build a paradox with a 10% upsizing.

I was curious about opinions of how to lay out the bottom.

As it turns out you can still fit the bottom on a 4x8 sheet of plywood ... without the chines.  That leaves you with two ways to go.

1. Scarf extra materials on to each side of the 4x8 for the chines.
- or -
2. Scarf two sections of plywood approx. 2'6" x 8' together length wise that would be put in place for the portion of the bottom that exceeded 4'.

Any thoughts as to which way would be better?  Why do you think so?

Has anyone played with the idea of putting a steel shoe on the bottom?

If you were to get some 1/4" plate rolled to the radius of the deepest part of the boat you would end up with the weight exactly where you needed it.  If it extended all the way out to the edge of the chines runners, it would also add support for them.

Any thoughts on this nueral hiccup?
