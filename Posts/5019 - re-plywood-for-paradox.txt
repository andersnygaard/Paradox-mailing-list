Hello Al,

I take on board what you say regarding the purchase of the full epoxy
requirement for Paradox, unfortunately if I were to go down that route I
would have to save up a good while before I was able to begin building
and I'm itching to get started.

As it is I've got some major rearranging to convert my back yard into a
boatyard! [:)]

Unless my personal situation were to change for the better in the
future, I'm going to have to buy components and materials as I go along
and just accept the larger total cost.

The way I see it is that with my way, OK it will be a long project but
at least I can start the build and get stuck in.

Greg
