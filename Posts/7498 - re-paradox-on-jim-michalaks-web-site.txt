Folks will spend hundreds on an outboard but use a tarp and expect the

little boat and will build one someday. I don't know how he deviated
from Matts plans, but I'm building a Wharram catamaran right now and
am shocked at the builder modes to his design. I know it's hard to
stick to the plans but that's probably the best course. Edward


The most obvious mod is the tiller. This shouldn't affect 
performance, of course, but it indicates that he was not averse to 
making changes.

If the line where the paint changes colour is the water-line then he 
is seriously under ballasted, which would have a considerable effect 
on the leeway resistance.
