I decided I'd rather avoid more blocks and sheaves... they've multiplied like topsy on the sprit rig as it is.  At last count I've got 10 compared to the Mk 1 which has 4.  I also want to keep my sheet lines low and to the rear of the boat as much as possible for maximum purchase, so I've cut a notch in the rear of the rudder cheek and we'll see how it works out.
