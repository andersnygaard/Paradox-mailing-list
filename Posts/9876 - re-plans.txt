Hi Ian, 

I am sure the Elliot sketches will be valuable when used in conjunction with the plans. I didn't mean it to sound like I was being negative. Wanda was very helpful and the book is full of gems. It's great that someone has documented the little tips and tricks that are not always present in plans.

Mark thanks for the heads up. I will try him again later and hopefully he'll be back.

Jason
