Oh. Sorry about that.

While I have you here, could you let me have your thoughts on plywood? I see that the Paradox designer suggests using ordinary exterior ply. Would that be as durable as proper marine ply?

I see on another website that deals with Little Cruiser that the owners are having to do a lot of rectification work because of rotting ply. I take it that Little Cruiser was built with the cheaper stuff. I wonder what the outcome would have been had marine ply been used.

But all wood can rot. So generally how durable are plywood boats I wonder. Would you be able to leave one to your grandchildren? Is there any resale value? Anyone bring me up to speed on this?
