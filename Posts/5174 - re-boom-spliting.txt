Subject: Re: Boom spliting

Andrew's solution with a slot for a locking nut has worked, and Al's 
method of tapping into epoxy has also been successful.  I have had no 
further problem since setting the bolt directly into epoxy filler.

Wherever there is a moving part in a design there's an inbuilt 
weakness; therefore the secret is to avoid articulation wherever 
possible.  Unfortunately with a sailing boat this is not possible and 
Paradox isn't an exception - she has a lifting rudder with gudgeons 
and pintles, a special tack arrangement, a roller reefing system, 
blocks for her running rigging and a boom tang fitting.  They all 
need to be strongly made and scrutinized when in use.

A question for you guys with finished boats. Concerning the Boom. 
Is 
there any trouble with the bolt for the mainsheet tang, splitting 
the 
wood or cracking. Bill, you mentioned that the bolt fell out? I'm 
at a 
point when I could add a band of fiberglass around the end of the 
boom, 
as long as I'm fiberglassing the reefing spool too. Any thoughts 
apprieciated. Steve Yahn
