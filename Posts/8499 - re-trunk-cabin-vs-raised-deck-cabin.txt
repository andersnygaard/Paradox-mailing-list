Subject: Re: Trunk Cabin vs Raised Deck Cabin


On the topic of seeing out the windows, how tall (or short) can one be and still sit comfortably inside a Paradox? Do I understand correctly that Matt is somewhat slight? Is there a problem such that if you are too tall you have to scrunch down to see out. Or if too short you can't see over the deck? Of course if too short a thicker seat cushion might solve the problem. I'm 6'1" (185.4cm).
