Rod, as Sarah Palin would say "You betcha".

P.S. Stephen Yahn... hope to hear about your first adventure in "Ironsides" when I return.

Hi Rod,
A dado is a groove sawn or routered into a piece of wood. It is usually done to a certain width so as to accept a piece of wood that is the same width. The two most common ways of cutting a dado are with a dado blade mounted in a table saw or a router with a straight bit mounted in it. Watch your fingers...
Good Luck.
John

Ok... thanks for this... never woulda thought of blowing this section up for a template. Now last question for awhile as I now have enough answers to work some more........ What the heck is a DADO? On DWG #8 and in other places on the plans Matt mentions dados in places like for the tank dividers. What does he mean here?

Many thanks again,
Rod

I think it is probably LC's rudder, it is certainly not off a Paradox.
