I know that Dave and Mindy have used an Outbacker antenna aboard
Little Cruiser. I don't have any experience with this antenna, but I'm
sure that provided it is kept clean, and lowered while underway, it is
a fine solution.

It seems like the lightning protection system of the Paradox design,
would lend itself well to a multiband HF rig with an auto tuner. The
groundplane is already there.  Just fasten the leadwire to the metal
installed in the mast. Right? This assumes of course, that the
lightning protection would be disabled for radio operations, and
enabled for lightning prone situations. I imagine that the auto tuner
could be a significant source of reserve floatation if it were
properly sealed and fastened as high as possible on the forward face
of Blkd #2.

Thoughts?
