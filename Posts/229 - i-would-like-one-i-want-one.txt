Subject: I would like one! I WANT ONE,

Hello group members, 

I do not have a Paradox but I would like one. This poses two questions.

1. Where can I get some working plans. I have down loaded the study plans but who can I contact for a set of working plans? 

2. How do you trailer sail your Paradox? What types of vehicle could pull one of these boats. They are not that heavy so I figure that I small car could do the job. I drive a 2000 Volkwagen Golf TDI (Turbo Diesel). VW says that the car can pull 900kgs and the Paradox is a little over 650kg. How much does it weigh fully loaded and ready to sail?  

I am green with envy with the fact that there is a boat out there that is shorter that my kayak (17') and I can sleep in it. Don't try sleep in a kayak, very wet dreams. Just joking! 

Thanks
