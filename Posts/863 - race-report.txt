Team Weed Warrior, second to CP3, followed solo Matt by 9 hours 20 minutes. Team Nootka was in hot pursuit for second place, landing 3rd, 3 hours and 50 minutes behind Weed Warrior. Is there a pattern developing here? The order of the class of the first three finishers at CP3 is: Class 4, single male; Class 4, double male; Class 4, double male. 

If the wind dies or is head on, Matt's alternate propulsion, chinese yuloh, is not likely to keep up with paddling Weed Warrior's outrigger canoe or Nootka's racing canoe. But Matt has built an impressive lead. Can he hold on? Stay tuned, anything could happen.
