I meant to tell you that I made a lovely laminated tiller from ash at the weekend. Glued it using SP epoxy that got so hot that it melted the yoghurt pot I'd mixed it in. After 24 hours of being clamped to a former the epoxy thing straightened out in ten minutes!
I have a lot to learn about epoxy resin but console myself with the thought that any where is epoxy on Enuf there is also a handful of bronze nails.
Made a new tiller from 1" galvanised electrical conduit (free from the scrap yard) in about an hour including collecting it and bending it!
I expect most folks know how to make a cheap bender but in case it helps someone you can bend tube in a block of wood. Drill a hole bigger than your tube (I used a 32mm hole for 25mm tube) in a piece of 4 by 2. Put the tube through the hole and apply gentle leverage as you slide the tube through the hole. With practise you can get a fair curve without buckling the tube. Last one I did like this, before the weekend, was in 1982 when I was an electrician.
Hope this is useful to someone.
