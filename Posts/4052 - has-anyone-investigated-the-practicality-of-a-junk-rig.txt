Subject: Has anyone investigated the practicality of a junk rig

Hello,

I'm another new group member and hopeful Paradox builder. I had been looking for boat to build for quite a while before settling on the Paradox design. During my search I became enamored with the Chinese Lug Rig. For a small cruiser it it appears to have several advantages. It reefs easily, is controlled during gybes, and doesn't put too much stress on the sailcloth. Windward performance seems to be pretty good if the sails are made with some camber in the panels.

So, my question. Has anyone out there already done some analysis and perhaps some experimentation with rigging a Paradox with a Chinese lug sail?
