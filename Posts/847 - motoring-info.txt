Hi All,

Just got back from a weekend of sailing (Motoring, no wind).If anybody is interested with a 4 hp 4 stroke (too much for a Paradox) she will do a little over 2 knots at just above idle and about 5 knots just under a 1/4 throttle. 5 knots seems to be a good cruising speed, very comfortable. you can get 6 knots but she would be pushing a lot of water. speed taken with GPS.

Ready for warm weather

David
