Subject: Status of plans for Enigma 460

Hi Matt,

I am interested in building an Engima 460, similar to the one George van Sickle has built. I was wondering what the current status of those plans are. I understand George has completed sea trials. Will you be offering the plans for sale in the near future?

If not, are  draft version of the plans that you made for George available for sale? I already purchased a set of plans for Paradox several years ago, so I am all set with the elements that are similar between the 2 boats (boom furling system, yuloh, etc.)

I started a Yahoo group for Enigma enthusiasts, a year or so ago, in order to capture all Enigma information in one place. 

http://groups.yahoo.com/group/enigma_sailboat/

Every few months, one of the members asks about the status of the Enigma plans.

Thank you for your help and have a good holiday season.

Sincerely,
Dave Raftery
