Subject: Sheer and Chine strakes question

I shaped my first sheer strake today as per the plans.
Although not a difficault task, I wonder if it would not be easier to plane the top surface ot the sheer and the bottom surface of the chine after they are actually fitted in the boat. It would seem that they will most likely need some work to fair in the deck and bottom anyway, so why bother trying to shape it now when its a long unweildy piece of lumber. Once glued into the hull I think it will be a lot easier to work without having the problems of clamping it securely.
What have others done? Any tips or advice welcome.

For info I've glued my side panels together so next weekend I intend to start dry fitting and sorting out the bevels on the bulkhead cleats. You never know, but I may even have a hull glued togeher by the end of July.
Time will tell!

Pete
