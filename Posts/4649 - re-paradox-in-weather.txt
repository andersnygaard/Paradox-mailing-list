Not storm conditions, as such (I don't go out then) but I once made a navigational error and ended up in a tide race, wind against tide, where solid water was regularly coming right over the boat. If I had been in an open boat I would have undoubtedly been swamped. As it was I was not very comfortable, being seasick most of the time, but the Paradox just carried on sailing through it and not one drop of water came inside.

Hoping for calm nights
