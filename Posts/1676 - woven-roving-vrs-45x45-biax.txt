Subject: Woven roving vrs 45X45 biax

Plans call for 3x24 oz woven roving, or 3x2 oz mat + 1x24oz roving to build to 4mm of total glass. Since I have a roll of 45x45 12 oz biax with no mat backing. would I be able to use 2 layers 12 oz biax, with a 90 degree layer between of 4 oz or so? Is our objective here abrasion resistance, or strength? biax is far stronger and uses far less epoxy. Thanks
