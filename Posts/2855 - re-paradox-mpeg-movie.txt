Thanks Paul,

Had a great 2 days out in steady 20-35 mph wind coming from the south, most of the time we hung in around the lee shore. got out in the strong stuff a bit and had a great time of it even tho we had way to much sail up! for anybody thats wondering, she has a 6 hp outboard on a folding mount, at just over idle in the movies. also she is loaded with 2 adults and tons of tools ballast, food.. ect water tanks were not filled, I expect she would do even better with them filled. Frieghters coming up the river would throw out some good wakes to hit and she took them from all angles with no fuss. to anybody thats interested, I used a bungee cord clipped behind the top of the outboard and pulled over to the cleat and NO more sheet problems, a blessing actually.

I have made a file folder called Jacks files, inside is the Bitcomet torrent files, anybody that wants to grab the movies should grab the bitcomet client and get the torrent files and download it, its very easy.

I hope to film more of her on the water in the future. I have a few others but shes so small shes hard to see. This weekend we hope to film from a powerboat.
