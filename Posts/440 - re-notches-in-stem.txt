I'm not sure about fun, I'm only building it because I can't buy it, but so far it has been quite satisfying.

A couple of weeks ago I got a CATIA (3D computer aided design) terminal at work, so I am enjoying building a Paradox model as part of my training. I am hoping to model all the components so that any or all parts can be assembled and viewed from any angle. If anyone has any special requests for a picture let me know.

an angle, as on the plans Al, doesn't have to be perfect because you will be gluing it up with thickened epoxy which will be stronger then the wood. An old saying in the boat building community goes "putty (epoxy) and paint will maker her what she ain' t" Are we having fun yet?
