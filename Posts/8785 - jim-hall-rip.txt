I am sad to report the death of James (Jim) Hall on 23rd August. He was often to be seen cruising England's West Country, for a few weeks at a time, in his Paradox, Faith. He maintained a cruising blog at <jimtimes.wordpress.com> and his down-to-earth approach to sailing and his sensible advice on various forums will be familiar to many of you. He had been cruising around Poole Harbour when he felt unwell, so returned home where he died soon after.

There will be a funeral at Salisbury Crematorium on Wednesday 7th September at 1300 (family flowers only), then afterwards at the Half Moon in Shaftsbury. His widow, Maggie, says that all are welcome to both venues, but casual dress only as he was a "scruffy character".

Maggie's phone number is 01747 852479.
