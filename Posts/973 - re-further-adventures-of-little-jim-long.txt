Subject: Re: Further adventures of Little Jim (long)

Thanks Al!!! It's so good to read of your continuing adventures aboard Little Jim. How do you feel about Little Jim's stability now? What is a "chain ferry"? I can only assume that you had enough coffee. I hope I am correct in recalling that Glen uses a chamois aboard Zoe for defogging. I like David's solution of optical cleaner. 

I'm eager to read your next installment.
