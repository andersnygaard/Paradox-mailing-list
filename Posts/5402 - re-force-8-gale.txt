Interesting about the bosuns chest and tool box. What do you recommend as the bare minimum for Paradox?

I suppose if I were doing an ocean passage I would take a spare spacer for the tack arrangement and maybe fit a second halyard on a separate external block. 

I'm sorry... could you clarify what a spare "spacer" for the tack arrangement is for a newbie? And is the second halyard in case the first one breaks or does it help out the original somehow? These questions will probably seem dumb to me later but it is morning now and I am struggling thru my first cup of coffee.

Thanks,
Rod
