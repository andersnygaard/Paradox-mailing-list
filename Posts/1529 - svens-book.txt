Subject: Sven's book

Hi all,

At this latitude the astronomical daylight is almost exactly six hours right now. I.e., three hours of gloomy dawn followed by three hours of gloomy dusk. What could be more suitable than bending over your computer and its dictionaries. 

Last summer Bj=F8rn wrote very appreciating about Sven Yrvind's new book. I do agree to this. Since some of you obviously are interested in Sven's thoughts, I translated a passage concerning Paradox and Matt Layden. I think Sven gives the story of Matt as well as of Paradox in a nice, conclusive and interesting way. The translation is uploaded in the files section as "chapter9.doc".

As you may notice, I am a highly unauthorized translator, but I think you will get the point. If there are any obvious mistakes making facts shiver, please let me know. Or if I've done any computerish eccentricities.

Originally, I thought it would mainly concern Paradox-builders. Since there has been some Sven-talk in the microcruising group recently, I thought it might be appropriate to cross-post to the microcruisers as well, =EDf it's OK.

Although unauthorized, I've got the author's permission, as well as support and greetings to you all.

Anyway, enjoy and a paradoxically Happy New Year to you all.

Kjell Karlsson
