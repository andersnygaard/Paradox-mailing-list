Make sure you get the sides parallel or it will all seize up.

They are 1m out! I'm hoping that will not be a problem.

Are you fitting a window in the hatch? I have found mine very useful when sailing from inside as otherwise you can't see the sail easily. I assembled the hatch without the window and then cut out the window aperture afterwards. I was worried that the ply would bend crooked if the aperture was cut first.

I started the hatch today by attaching the sides. Tomorrow I have to do the bending + 25% and glassing both sides. I just hope I worked out the measurement for the curve right.

My runners are not exactly like those drawn by Matt, but not far out. I made them from the teak scraps I bought at the Beale Boat Show from Robbins of Bristol. I expect you remember me showing them to you when I had a go in your 'Little Jim'. You'll certainly not forget your anxiety when I was trying to sail your boat and made a hash of it. Anyway, I enjoyed your demonstration of how it should be done.
