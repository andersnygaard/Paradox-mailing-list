Hi Pete,

Just noticed that I had never answered this e-mail.The new sheeting arrangement works fine but does require a turning block below deck. It only fouls the vane gear on rare occasions. The big problem here of course is that the boom overhangs the transom. With the mark II sail it overhangs less but is still annoying. I'm sure the sail could be designed with a higher aspect ratio to get the sail inboard but that would also mean a taller mast which would no longer fit inside the boat. Everything is a compromise!
