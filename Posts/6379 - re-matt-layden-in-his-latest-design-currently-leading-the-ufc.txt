Pete,
I was surprised how large they were and intended to study them more.  It seems they are tied in with the main sheet drain system between them in a channel that crosses just under the top.  Sorry. I just can't remember because I did not get back to Grok it.  The little boat is just full of these kinds of intricate little details. Awesome, that Matt.  I worship the man as a designer and tried to kiss his foot but he is so unassuming, he would not let me.  That was predicted.  The finish of the entire boat was superb, I assume it had a layer of fiberglass on  the exterior of 6mm marine ply?  It was obvious he was running late in completion and testing.  I think he was unsure about how much ballast (lead shot) to put in it in addition to the gear.  Fine line between too much and too little in such a little skinny boat.  I tried to leave him alone and only hovered about 10 min. Thursday evening.

Nels,
Here's a picture of Elusion with her "lid" on.

I expect he will have a spray skirt for when he has to paddle.
I'm intrigued by the vent system. He mentions in one of his updates that it's working very well. I expect that is what those 2 pipes are sticking out form the rear of the cabin. John, did you get a chance to see how these work?

Of course you don't need any spray protection when the weather is like
this, just the sun hat!

I was getting a bit worried about Matt when I looked this morning and saw no updates since last night, the last one being nowhere near shore. Once his tracker restarted it looks like he spent the night either on, or anchored behind a little spoil island. It's a real race between the 3 leaders, I hope they don't push themselves to exhaustion.

Pete
