Subject: Zero three day cruise

Hi guys,

I've just done a three day singlehanded cruise in Zero, crossing the open section of Moreton Bay to Moreton Island. Zero had no trouble with 15 knot winds and 1 meter waves and traveled about 80 kilometers in all (I use a chart book which has a kilometer grid scale). Once again, I used Zero's shallow draft to shortcut across some large sandbanks saving hours of sailing time. I had to shelve plans for a longer New Year's cruise because the weather has been mostly poor since Christmas (three greedy dive boat operators overturned boats on local coastal bars within 1 week - not the type of dunking the divers expected).

I'm still very happy with Zero and quite confident in her ability to handle the conditions she was designed for. The weather was very humid and would have made two up cruising uncomfortable.

By for now,
Andrew
