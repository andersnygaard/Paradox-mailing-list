Hello,

I have a question for Australian and other tropical Paradox builders. What is the temperature and humidity like inside the Paradox? Here in Port Macquarie, we have several days a year over 120f, so I'm just curious about how the Paradox is to sail in the stifling heat of summer.

Thank you!
