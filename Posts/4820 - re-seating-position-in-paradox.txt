Subject: Re: Seating Position in Paradox

Hi Nels,

If I sit very straight in Little Jim I can just get my hair to brush 
against the hatch cover, about 35.5" (I am 5'6" tall).

If you want to increase the clearance it would probably be better to 
lower the sole. Raising the roof has knock-on effects on the sail 
stowage.

It is worth noting that, although Derek considered a number of 
possibilities he ended up building (approximately) to plan.

I have been very pleased with my mod, using the seat as a backrest 
when sitting inside (see photo section under Little Jim) which I find 
makes the seating even more comfortable. Thinks: could I add a couple 
of armrests to the bottom of the seat?

Another idea, which I haven't been able to try yet, is a small 
inflatable pool chair. Now that would be real armchair sailing!

Hoping for calm nights

Al,
