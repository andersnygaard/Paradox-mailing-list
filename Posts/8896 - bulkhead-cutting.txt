Question1; I've started drawing the SB side forward, transom and bulkhead no.2
there is not enough space for the transom, about 35mm overhang at the bottom.
also no2 at 50mm or 100mm but joint, there is a small overhang that won't fit on the panel. Is that correct?

Question 2;
Do deck beams run to the side of the bulkheads or to the cleats?
