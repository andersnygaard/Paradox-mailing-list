Chris of course I remember meeting you at Eufaula,  How could I forget the Enigma 460, the biggest 15' boat I've ever seen.  I wish I had measured it, because my mind still is skeptical.  With only about a one foot difference in waterline, the 460 appeared to have twice the interior volume. 

I bet we all would be curious what you think of your Paradox, and which you prefer - The Paradox at 420cm or the big Enigma at 460cm?  They probably both have great qualities.  My guess is for a solo cruise, you would lean toward the Paradox, and if you had company - the Paradox would be left at home.

Respectfully,
Bobby
