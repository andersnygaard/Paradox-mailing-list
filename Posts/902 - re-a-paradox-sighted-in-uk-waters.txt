As far as I can tell, from various readings from the bathroom scales and a bit of calculation we were only about 20kg lighter than the design weight. I shall have that as movable ballast on board for the next trip, when I hope to be sailing.

I think the main problem was just too much wind. I am not sure I could have rowed my dinghy very easily in those conditions. Of course in open water, and when I have a better idea of what I am doing, I would be sailing not sculling.

Sounds like the common problem of not enough ballast to sink the Paradox to its lines. Some have declared the Paradox unsailable due to trying to sail it empty, bobbing on top with no chine leverage for directional stability and no immersion to cause stability. 

Hoping for calm nights
