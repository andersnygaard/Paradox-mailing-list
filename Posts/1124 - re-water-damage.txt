As long as the wood is dry now, Epoxy coating would be what I would recommend. Here are a couple of links that discuss the role of epoxy in helping to stem rot

The first boat I owned, at age 14, was a 14' Long Islander class ( sort of a pocket lightning). That boat was a well past its prime and epoxy saturation helped to prolong its use several years. This was in the early sixties. I bought the stuff from a guy in Northport NY who was promoting the method. He may have been Platt Montfort, of aerolite boat fame. It was a long time ago, so I'm not positive it was he.

Anyhow, I used the boat trought college and then sold it for about what I paid for it- $200. The method worked for me then, I expect it will work for you now. Good Luck,Larry
