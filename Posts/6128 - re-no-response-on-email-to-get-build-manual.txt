I'd be glad to make copies of my manual for anybody who wants one. No charge for anything, just buy me a beer sometime. Email me at jjamieson2@yahoo.com.

If anyone can help Dave out, PLEASE make that two copies of the build manual. I tried making contact all Spring and gave up in the early Summer. I thought I'd go ahead and start the project because I have built a few boats and thought I could workout whatever comes up. But at the same time I like being prepared and the build manual seems like an excellent starting point.

If anyone is willing to part with their copy (or copy theirs) I would be more than glad to pay you for what you paid plus shipping and or any other expense you incur.

Thanks, Rick
