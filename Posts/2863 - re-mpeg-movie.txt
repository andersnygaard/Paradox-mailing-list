Nels,

I live in central Alberta. Moved here Sept. 2004 from southern Manitoba. Thought I had escaped all the flooding problems of Manitoba. It was not to be. Over the last couple of weeks, we have had 6 communities around us flooded to some extent. Go figure. 

The way I made it work was first I downloaded Bitcomet software. Then I was able to download the mpeg movie. But I couldn't get it to open up. I thought Bitcomet would play it for me. I didn't realize it's a peer to peer program. So, following Jacks advice, I found it in My Documents. All I had to do was click on it and play it in Windows Media Player. Hope this helps.

Now I'm going to get my atlas out and see if I can find Dog River. Or Corner Gas. Either one.

From one Canuck to another,

Adolf

Okay now maybe you can explain it to me:-)

Are you the fellow from Manitoba? Do you have your ark built yet? I live in Saskatchewan.
