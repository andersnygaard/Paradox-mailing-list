Less resin in the joint is not good if it's a structural joint!

Microballoons are for bulking the resin up to make it soft and sandable. Use this for fairing only! The cured product is soft and weak.

Fibrous fillers like wood flour, "Cab-o-sil" and others are *structural* powders. They give you a composite material which is much stronger than straight resin. Use these powders for *joints*. Don't try to sand this stuff; it's nearly impossible. Clean up the squeeze-out before it cures or you'll be sanding forever.
