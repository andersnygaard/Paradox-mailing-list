Subject: Plans Source?

Hi All,

I just joined the group.

Emailed Dave Bolduc at mbolduc@triad.rr.com last week, asking if plans are still available and how much they are.

Unfortunately, I haven't received a reply so far. 

Maybe he's on vacation or just doesn't answer emails very often. 

In the files section it says: 

Mail your request for plans to
Mr. Dave Bolduc
1736 Phillips Avenue
Greensboro, NC, 27405, USA
The price for the plans is $40.00

If anyone knows Dave personally, and can confirm that's correct, I'll send him a check and hope the plans show up.

Cheers,
Nathan
