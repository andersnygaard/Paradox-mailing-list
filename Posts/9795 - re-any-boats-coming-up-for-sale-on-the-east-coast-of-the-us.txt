Hello Paul,

Andre Francois has two paradox boats and he may be willing to depart with one; however, he is in Canada. He often monitors this site as a member so maybe he will jump in to contact you.

I live in NY and drove to Wisconsin to get a 'dox. They do come up for sale occasionally, it is sparse and the effort may be in taking a long drive. It is worth it if the boat is in good condition, the drive takes less time than building one. If you enjoy building then build and make it a great experience. I hope you eventually get a 'dox - - as as a neighboring state, we may someday sail together.

Stay in touch and let is know of your progress from time to time.

Best,
Deric
