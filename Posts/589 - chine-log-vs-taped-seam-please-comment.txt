Subject: Chine log vs Taped seam (please comment)

Ok I've been looking at a whole lot of info on Taped Seam construction and then looking at my Paradox Plans.

And It seams, for a newbie like me, that using a Taped seam technique rather than paradox's Chine Log technique might be easier.

One reason seems to be that when using the Taped Seam one actually wants a gap between the two boards while the Chine Log technique seems to demand a tight joint.

Now I do not presume to know anything really about boat building and so I know that I must be missing a point here.

Maybe the Chine Log technique provides a more solid joint?

And maybe it is not as hard to do as I as suspect.

Any comment on this will be welcome...
