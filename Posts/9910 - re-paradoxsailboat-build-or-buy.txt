I know some purists prefer to avoid motors and I can understand their philosophy. A Yuloh is sufficient.

However a motor - electric or gasoline- allows the sailor to go where, and when, he chooses. It is also a safety feature.

There are several Paradox videos on Youtube where the paradox is under tow by another motorised vessel.

I believe that on balance the advantages of a motor outweigh the disadvantages.

Hello paradoxians,

I too entertained the idea of adding an outboard to the dox.

In my opinion, such a decision is to be weighted thoroughly.

The intent of the paradox design is to be effective with simplicity. There are advantages of a motor and for me there are more disadvantages.

More things to break
Can get snagged in line
Distribution of weight considerations
Extra expense
Possible registration of boat required depending on the regs
Fuel ??

Advantage;
More power for going against current
Can get moving without wind
Can increase likely hood of staying on a schedule
Could be more pros..????

I just wanted to throw it out there for folks to consider. I'm not advocating a position on the matter. A boat and what an owner does to their boat is a personal matter.

Others may feel free to add pros and cons for consideration.

Sail on paradoxians

Mind you I had no plans and there was a lot of thinking time.  Took me a month to finish the inside of a Paradox.  Even if I have built several boats, I think it would still take me at least 6 months to build a Paradox. The cost for my Enigma was over $3000 without the trailer.  Paradox will cost more than that just for materials and sail.  Buying is by far the best option, at any price, if you can get your hands on one. I drove from the East Coast of Canada to the West Coast of the United States to get mine- and I am still convinced it was easily worth the 5 grand I paid plus the 12000 km trip!
