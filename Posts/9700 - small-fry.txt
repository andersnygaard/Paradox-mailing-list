Dear [Recipient],

I am excited to announce that I am now the proud new owner of "Small Fry", the famous paradox from Perth, Western Australia. I extend my thanks to Geoff Davis, the previous owner/builder, for making this possible. It was a pleasure to meet him in the process.

Thank you and best regards,

[Your Name]
