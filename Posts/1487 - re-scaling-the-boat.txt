Hi Fredrik,

Welcome to the group. If you go to the files section you will see a folder called "Larger Paradox" which gives some figures to increase the size by 20%. The original designer feels this would work fine.

There are also some other folders  giving you some ideas as to the materials required. I have not built one myself since I too am waiting for a larger plan:-)

There are also some links to other sites in the links section - that have a lot of information. These links also have links to even more places!

As you know, building time depends on your skill and how much time. tools and space you have available. For most builders, they find that the finishing takes as long as the building. Most people seem to take about a year of part time work.

Cost of materials also depends a lot on where you live. Your best bet would be to get in touch with other builders in your part of the world. There are several in Norway, Denmark and Sweden who have built with plywood and epoxy and could probably help you. What part of Norway are your from? Are you near Oslo? I might be able to get in touch with a fellow in Oslo who has built a 25 foot schooner and used to post here occasionaly. But first check out all the other websites and information listed here.

Good luck, Nels
