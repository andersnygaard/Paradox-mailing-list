Glen,

I am sorry to hear you did not go on that trip. You put your heart and soul into building one of the finest Paradox's ever built. After the trucker told me I was stunned, but I was not the creator...just the hoped for care taker of legacy. I almost bought another Paradox, but never felt the same about any other boat. Keep in touch...

Mark

Hello David,

I'm afraid life has gotten in the way of my trip and I have had to postpone it. I am hoping to getaway now in Oct. of this year if I can. I fell into a real depression at the loss of Zoe and have pretty much just been a lurker since. Thanks for your concern as to my whereabouts. I plan to be at the Cedar Key mess-about this year. Would be great to see you and the others if you are going to be there.

Best Regards

Glen
