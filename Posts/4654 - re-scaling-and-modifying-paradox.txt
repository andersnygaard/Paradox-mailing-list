Hi, 

Thanks for all the replies. I was thinking of 100kgs of ballast, but perhaps a bit more would be helpful depending on the conditions. I was thinking that containers would make the build quicker and less epoxy dependant. I would not be keen on making paradox any longer than 16ft, as the stability would be reduced by the larger rig needed to drive the longer hull. 

I dont think that the extra length of a longer paradox would make launching any more difficult - it would only be the same size as a wayfarer / drascombe / west wright potter sort of boat. 

I have a number - 8 I think 3/4 ply panels on my garage roof which is coming down!!!!! which got me thinking if the wife was away at her mums for a few days the basic paradox hull would not be out of reach! 

What thickness are the sides? I was thinking that if you got away with 1/4 it would be lighter up top, 

=£40 bottom 
=£30 sides and top
=£30 for lumber etc. cls divided into two for chines, 

I think £100 pounds / $200 would cover the basic materials excepting epoxy and the glazing, what thickness is it by the way?

A mainsail of ebay for a 16ft dinghy would be great cut down for the lug sail and a storm jib.  

I ought to get the plans but that would give the game away! I am a perpetual dreamer. 

I have several thoughts in mind.

By the way has anyone seem the little explorer boat that is sailing around the UK at moment what do people think of that? Would make an interesting race? 

As you can see I need to get out more!

Yours
James
