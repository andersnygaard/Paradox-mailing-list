Subject: Re: Steel?

The whole boat could easily be built in steel. I've seen many steel boats smaller than 14ft cruising the canals of Amsterdam. A simple box like the Paradox lends itself to steel construction. However, I might build the topsides and cabin from aluminum to help with stability, though I don't think it would much matter. I'd also make sure to put in sufficient floatation. Welding steel on a small boat that can be turned over like the Paradox is not hard and would require only a small 110volt welder. The hulls could literally be fabbed up in a few days. Modern paints stick to steel very well even on boats.
