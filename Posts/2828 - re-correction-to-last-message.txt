Hi Derek,

Drool, drool, drool, What is the asking price? I would love to have that little beauty. What's it weigh <30 lb?

Tell you what - you buy it and if you don't like it by next year I will come and get it. Just don't scratch it eh?

I expect it could easily handle over 200 lb. Just that your feeboard decreases and you have to better at managing it in bigger waves. Also you could add a spray cover and convert it to a small kayak.

Better not give you any more info or you might not want to sell it.

BTW Matt loves the Rob Roy design. That is where he got his inspiration from for the canoes he has used in the last two Everglades races.
