Excuse me?

Larry, you're advocating that a boat have a lee helm? Noooooo! that's a recipe for disaster. A boat's helm should be neutral towards weather, so that if you let go of the tiller/wheel, she will (preferably slowly) head up into the wind. Otherwise, you risk a knock down. (N.B. What I mean by "neutral towards weather" is that it should not take much rudder deflection to hold her head off the wind, otherwise, you suffer from excess drag and accelerated wear on rudder fittings.)

As for you and the babes, it was probably all the wood in the temporary mizzenmast and it's rig back in the cockpit that caused your hanging in stays (better then hanging in zipper ;-). I'll take it as an article of faith that you where appropriately rigged for the ocassion ;-)
