Dear Members of Paradox Sailboat Group,

It is with a heavy heart that I am writing this email. I have tried to write this for quite some time, but now I cannot stall any longer.

I am offering a (mostly) completed Paradox (Gripen) for free to anyone who is interested. However, it has been damaged during the move, and its chine runners and part of the bottom needs to be stripped and rebuilt, unless you have some really magical boat-building skills. I built it myself over a period of 3.5 years, but due to my personal situation, I have not been able to repair it for the past 3 years. And now, I soon have to move again, and there will be no place for a boat.

If you are interested, please contact me in a few weeks; otherwise, I will put up a regular boat ad and, if there are no takers, it will be scrapped.

Thank you for reading!

Best regards,

C. Skjutare
