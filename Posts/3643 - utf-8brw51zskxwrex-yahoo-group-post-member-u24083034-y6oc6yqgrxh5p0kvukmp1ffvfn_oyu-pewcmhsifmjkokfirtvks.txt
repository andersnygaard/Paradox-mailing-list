Yesterday I finished the rubbing down.
Well, more truthfully, it is rubbed down as much as I am prepared to do. I really hate rubbing 
down!
I had hoped to roll on the pigmented epoxy today but it's raining again. No water shortages 
in the West Midlands of England. The forecast isn't good for a couple of days but we move 
slowly forward :0)
