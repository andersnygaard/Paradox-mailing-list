Jack,

I'm happy to say that A Speck on the Sea is selling very well and that means that in a few months I may be able to make another announcement of interest to Paradoxers.  : )

Also, I'd like to ask Paradoxers who have read the book to send me any information they think I should cover in the next book.  Did I miss anything? Let me know because I want the book, and its subsequent editions, to be THE bible of small craft voyaging.

For me one of the most interesting stories was that of the City of Ragusa. I did a huge amount of research on that boat including flying to Liverpool last January to do some on-location detective work.  My research led to many more questions, but the book has sparked enough interest in Croatia and New Zealand that the mysteries may soon be solved.  A UK television company has even expressed an interest in pursuing it.

I find small boat voyaging to be a neglected area of maritime study even though the vast majority of boaters today are small boat sailors.  It's obvious the glossy boat magazines (with a few exceptions) don't give a damn about us.  We've got to look out for ourselves.  To me, the Paradox is a "civilian" version of some of the great micro-voyaging "capsule" boats of the 1960s- a lineage that really goes back to Bill Verity's Nonoalca.  He was a great man in many respects and in my estimation Matt's designs are predicated in Verity's work, and those that followed during that golden age of small boat sailing (1965-85) especially Gerry Speiss and Serge Testa. All these guys are my heros, and I'm a confirmed micro-boater because of them.
