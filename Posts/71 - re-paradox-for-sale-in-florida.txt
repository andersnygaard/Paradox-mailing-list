Glen, Is that a misprint, $500 for a PARADOX on a trailer, and you didn't buy it! surely you mean $5000. Was it good condition, as per drawings, what was the workmanship like, how complete, was the trailer any good. For $500 you should have bought it, sold the trailer and bought the right one. $500 is the Price of just the sail over here in Blighty. That's about =A3340. STREWTH.
