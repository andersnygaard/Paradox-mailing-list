Hello,

I am seeking clarification regarding cleats for the P&Stbd Lockers on the after face of Bulkhead #1. I noticed that DWG #7 does not show them, but they are depicted on DWG #3 and 4. I am wondering if there is a measured layout for these cleats in the plans that I may have missed?

Thank you for your assistance in this matter.

Best regards,
