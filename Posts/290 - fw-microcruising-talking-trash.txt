I had tried crossposting this to smallboats, but yahoo said this afternoon that paradoxbuilders@yahoogroups.com doesn't exist. Here's another attempt.

There's one product along those lines i've seen (West Marine catalog?). It's an X-shaped folding stand (like a camp stool) with a toilet set on top. A bag is placed under/attached to it. I presume after use one does tie it off with a twistwrap or the like. Probably not quite the thing to use in a seaway imo.
Untreated animal and human waste in land fills is said to be a serious problem.

BTW, I don't buy stuff from West Marine - they're high priced, but their catalog is a nice wish book. A local outfit called Fisherman's Supply has a _thick_ non-free ($5) catalog and they really do supply the fishing fleet (but will sell to individuals). I know they have (or had) a link on the web somewhere, but I couldn't find it with a quick search. I did find that it seems to be a common name for such stores and for all I know it's a chain, but I didn't get that impression when I went in there. OTOH, it's hard to imagine a local store putting out a 600+ (est.) page b/w glossy catalog with color inserts.

We also have nice place called "Doc Freeman's" that's been around practically since the Indians (err.. ok, 1947) that has a really great deal for boat builders. If you give them a drawing deposit of $2500, you can get unbelievably stellar deals on their stuff. I think I was quoted 40% off on a marine diesel (new Yanmar 1GM10 - retail ~$5000 or ~$3000 with this discount!), and epoxies, paints etc. are 50% off. Once you spend the $2500, you have to spend $1000/yr to keep it open, so it's probably only worthwhile during construction, but what a deal!

As long as this has turned out to be info on "stuff" http://www.boatdesigns.com/ has great mail-order prices on System-3 epoxy resins and additives, fiberglass cloths and tapes, bronze fastenings (don't use "stainless" steel or hardware store fastenings!), hatches and portlights and other goodies. They may actually be cheaper then local walk-in places, even with shipping. For example, I think their price on epoxy is about 1/2 of retail and maybe as little as 1/3 of West Marine's price.

P.S. A minor funny: absent any infection, male urine is sterile; female urine, by virtue of passing through "the bush", isn't. (Don't hit me, both a woman friend and a doctor have told me this!)
