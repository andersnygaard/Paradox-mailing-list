What you describe are, I think, more differences in materials philosophy than a matter of design philosophy.

FWIW, a double ender does not have more buoyancy in the stern than a transom sterned boat (think about it: buoyancy is a matter of volume and a box (transom) has more volume than a triangle (double-ender)). Double-enders also have less carrying capacity than a transom sterned boat of the same general LOD, beam and draft (according to John Welsford).
