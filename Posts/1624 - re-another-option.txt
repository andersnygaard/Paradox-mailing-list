Subject: Re: Another Option

If you read the subject line you will see it fits with that topic. If space becomes an issue, I can always delete it - or you can if you find it offensive.

I think this is an option that hasn't been explored. Using outside floatation and I think it is worth considering if for no other reason than innovative information.

So if nobody shows interest I will delete it at the end of the day.

Do you want me to delete the Bris stuff I added as well? Does everything have to be directly related to Paradox or what?

Cheers, Nels
