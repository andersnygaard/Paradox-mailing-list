Hi Ray,

Whatever you do, don't attempt to use a motorcycle battery-
unless its a SLA or Gelcell type, which I don't think they are 
usually. The ordinary ones are not meant for constant discharge to 
low levels and will be ruined by this treatment in short order!
Even less than a half-dozen cycles down to flat will be enough to 
kill it, whereas the SLA types are often spec'd for several hundred.
Cheers,
Alan.
