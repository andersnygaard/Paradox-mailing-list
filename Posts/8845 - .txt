Subject: Paradox sailboats

Yes Bobby, I have two Paradox sailboats. "Iota" is in mint condition, last summer I tuned it all up, with new windows and new paint inside and out. "Pequeno" is in the shop now, needs the entire interior to be redone, new tiller and mast adjustments; I have not sailed it yet. This second boat is for friends to borrow, or maybe I will ship it to Europe to do a trip there. Might also eventually sell it if I get a bad case of the BBB and get involved in designing and building a two person cruiser.

BTW, currently planning a loop cruise with Iota around Albemarle Sound in North Carolina in March. Chris Curtis has shown interest in joining me with Scout. In case someone else is interested in coming along.

Have a great day!

André
