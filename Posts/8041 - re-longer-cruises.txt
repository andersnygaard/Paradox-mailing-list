Thanks for your detailed reply, Geoff. All I can say to what you have done is WOW - 6 days sailing with no stops - when was it you said that you were going to begin your circumnavigation?!

Interesting that you have been able to get your Paradox to self steer without the need for an Autohelm.

And that you listened to the radio, quite a bit. That is something I've started to do latterly and I've found hearing a human voice - even if what you hear on the radio is rubbish (I try to avoid listening to D.J.'s whenever possible on land), does lift your spirits.

Another thing I'd like to know - anti-fouling. If you were in the water for a month, you would have had quite a buildup of marine life on your hull wouldn't you? What did you do? Scrub down the sides and hope that the flat bottom abrades off the fouling on the sand? I don't want to pollute the sea with copper epoxy and such like, so my plan was to scrub the boat regularly.

Cheers,

Rob.

PS: Going to have to buy some plywood very soon as I've completed all the spars, the yuloh and the stem. The stem's a bit of a trick to make. I found a chain saw worked pretty well!
