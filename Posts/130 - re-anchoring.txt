A technique I have found useful is to assume you will be anchoring in no more then X amount of water, multiply by seven and secure your anchor line to the bow cleat leavinging the result ready to be deployed by bring it back to the cockpit. Now attach another line (this is the inhaul line) to the anchor line via a smooth ring or perhaps a carabiner, the line will have to be long enough to reach from the bow to the cockpit.

For this example lets say we will be anchoring in no more then 5 ft. we make fast our anchor line leaving 35 ft. to be deployed. we lead it back and make it fast to the stern cleat and stow every thing away. Once we reach our intended anchorage we can do one of two things, (a) round up and deploy the anchor from the cockpit, back down by back winding the sail and set the anchor. (b) deploy the anchor while it is still cleated to the stern cleat with way on, when the anchor sets release the anchor line from the stern cleat and the boat will lie head to wind, generally this will ensure a very well set anchor and a good nights sleep. In either case the line with the ring around the anchor line will be taken forward by the anchor line. 

When you are ready to leave retrive the anchor line by pulling on the inhaul line until you can get your hands on the anchor line then weigh anchor, stow all away and your off.
