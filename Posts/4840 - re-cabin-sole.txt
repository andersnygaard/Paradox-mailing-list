Is 65 sq ft the size of the Enigma sail? Paradox has 100 sq ft.

If you took 1 ft off the boom you would need to move the mast back (6"?) to keep the centre of effort in the same place.

Not sure about sorting out the spinnaker, when it all goes wrong, in a Paradox style boat. Let us know how you get on. 

I am in Yeovil, Somerset, so Poole is handy for me, but Jeff lives on the Isle of Wight so the Solent may be a better venue. Bill and I are planning to be cruising in the West Country for most of May, calling at Plymouth for the start of the Transat on 11th and the Jester Challenge on 31st. hopefully reaching the Scillies between those dates.

Hoping for calm nights
