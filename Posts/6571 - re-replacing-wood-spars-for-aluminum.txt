Subject: Re: replacing wood spars for aluminum

Hi Reefing roller experts.

I humbly state that I do not understand how the Reefing roller and the boom can move into the sailing position once the sail is tensioned. I seem to miss one axis.

Copterpack' could you add one more picture of what the system looks like? You could use a length of line instead of sail and stretch it up (as if you pull on the halyard).

Thanks
