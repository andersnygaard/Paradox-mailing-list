Subject: Mainsheet and outboard

I've probably asked this before but don't recall an answer.
I will be using an outboard on my boat. Does it make sense to fasten the mainsheet on top of the rear deck and take the free end through the top of the deck rather than the transom? 
I am thinking that it will be less likely to foul the outboard.
Any thoughts appreciated.
