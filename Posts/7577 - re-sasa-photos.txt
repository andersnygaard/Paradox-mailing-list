'Free surface effect' I hate when that happens!!!
Of the different aqua carrying systems, I think clear bladders are best, they form themselves into any crevice and are sturdy, have a tap and as you suggest your eggs aren't all in one basket.
Concerning building a Paradox, there are a thousand tasks and I only had to do each task four times to get them right.
Peruse the photo of my attempts to draw the bulkheads.
This consumed days 1,2,3... and four (bonus!).
But don't be dismayed, build a Paradox and people take a genuine interest in you. Particularly when you get to the bit where the thing looks more like a billy cart than a boat. And you explain yes you steer with it with ropes "like a billy cart" And you say yes. Of course the big news is when it gets out you're building a sailing boat without a keel or a centreboard or leeboards. Then everyone (yes everyone, if its an island you live on) think you are JPN (just plain nuts). But there are benefits, like the local grocer sells you avocados considerably cheaper because avo's are supposed to be brain food. It's just the populace having their little joke.
I'll show 'em.
But if Matt, Dave and Mindy are pulling some sort of international hoax... well I suppose it will make a very good billy cart.

I, too, worry about the water ballast.
I understand that the water ballast is drinking water; so, as you cruise and consume water, you reduce your ballast. It will start to slosh (or sploosh) and your boat will suffer from free surface effect. Potable water tanks are risky: one small contamination and your whole supply is contaminated; and those tanks will not be easy to clean.
I'd prefer a little more lead ballast, and to keep my drinking water in 2 pint milk bottles (jugs). These will be easy to redistribute.

Although nobody seems to have reported any of these problems: am I missing something?
Perhaps these things were explained in previous messages?

Yes, a double tillered Paradox.
I don't think that has been suggested in my reading of earlier posts.
The above deck tiller should allow the bungy cord or surgical rubber to tiller/sheet to boom self steering system (Captain Voss raw chic).
I will upload some photos showing how I tortured my beloved SaSa's behind into shape.
While I'm rabbiting on I want to suggest to the Paradox builder/owners how about water bladders in the water holds. The holds don't have baffles, 70lbs of water/ballast lolling back and forward, this way and that and making splooshing sounds when you're trying to get to sleep? The water might be better contained in a number of bladders (include their own taps) down there in the holds..

Re-reading your message gave me the answer: you'll have two tillers.

I'm looking at your build (and others) before deciding whether to build a Paradox myself.

You're putting the tiller above the after deck instead of through the transom. So you won't need the hole in the transom. I see your transom has no holes, neither for the tiller nor for the spars.
So why have you installed the bendy-scoopy-water-drainy thing inside the transom?

I'm impressed that you have built a curved transom: could you give us more details on how you did that?

Oops, problem uploading pics, going to Johanna file. Sorry about that.
There is a photo of the 'upper tiller', above deck to enable self-steering. There will also the beneath deck tiller as well for interior steering.
