Subject: Re: Pounding?

I've never experience much pounding in Little Cruiser, Swamp Thing or Paradox under sailing conditions.  At anchor they might slap a little if it get real rough, but even this is rare due to these boats' heavy displacement and wet forefoot.  However, under power and going straight into a short head sea we have had some pounding in Little Cruiser.  Nonetheless, this is easily corrected by simply having both my wife and I sit on one side of the boat, which then heels the boat over sufficiently for there to be a nice "V" again.
