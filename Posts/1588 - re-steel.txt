Paradox offers no challenges to anyone who can assemble a decent set of bookshelves. Matt has faced the challenges and has defeated them. The boat is complete.

There is no doubt that steel will offer challenges that will have to be overcome, but no more so than in wood. Steel or wood is a matter of personal choice. If people were afraid to experiment with design changes we'd all still be using coracles.
