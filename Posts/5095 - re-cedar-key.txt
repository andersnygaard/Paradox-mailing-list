I wish I was Howard, my wife's illness now requires that some one be with her all the time so I'm going to have to for-go this years event. A friend maybe bringing my peep hen down, he's supposed to let me know this evening. I would sure love to see your Alacrity, I have always admired them. I hope everyone has a good time.
