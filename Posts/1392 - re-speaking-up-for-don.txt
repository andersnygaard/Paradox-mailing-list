Thank you Bill, for the time you took to ask if I was to hasty. As mentioned previously I labored long and hard over the decision. I reviewed the photos section, files section and message section for positive inputs from Don and found the negative far outweighed the positive. I myself tried to just ignore his attacks on my person. According to his stated beliefs, by so doing I made his accusations true. To me that implies he is spoiling for an augment. He openly attacked Al for plagiarism because he wouldn't take the time to carefully read the thread. If he really wanted to contribute anything to this group, why should he feel it necessary to form another? I figured, and maybe I'm wrong, that he would just be popping up here occasionally to take a pot shot at someone and then duck back over to the cover of his group. I have taken the time to send a personal e-mail to Don and should he want to discuss the ban off post he has my e-mail address but the bickering on open post had to stop. I think the last two days are an indication that calm is prevailing across the group again and we are back on subject.

Tailwinds

Glen
