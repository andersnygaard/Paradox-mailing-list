Subject: Re: Pounding?

Hi Alan.

Paradox is much heavier than Matt's new 12' design.  This should tend to keep Paradox's forefoot submerged in most cases to reduce pounding.  The amount of rocker looks a little less in the Paradox and this would also tend to keep the forefoot submerged.  

Bolger's 15' Micro has a great deal of rocker and problems with pounding.  He has just added the V bottom bow on this and similar designs in the last couple of years, to try to reduce pounding.
