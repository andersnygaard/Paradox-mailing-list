Hi Bill

Already tried that.
I'm very fond of the bright yellow one "Petite Lady" but I'm not sure with a red sail. Then there is Zoe, of course - a very beautiful boat, as is Swash but I'm not over fond of white.
I like Zero's grey a lot and I've viewed Little Jim in the green as it were.
At the moment a paler green is slightly in front of grey with a red trim.
I'm never in a month of Sundays going to be able to match the finish on Zoe so workmanlike is the best I expect to do. A flattish grey would be good for hiding errors.
More help still needed......Derek
