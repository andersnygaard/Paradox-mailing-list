Subject: Re: Bronze Lower Gudgeon 

Are there any clear photos of making the lower gudgeon for Paradox? Don Elliott's photos aren't very clear and I wondered if anyone else had better ones. Also, has anyone cast a bronze gudgeon in place of the glass-filled one? Any reason I couldn't or shouldn't cast one in bronze?

I have this photo http://www.smallsailboats.co.uk/paradox/build/gudgeon.jpg showing the moulded gudgeon. To make it I used the sides of a plastic ice cream carton for the bendy part and pieces of wood covered with plastic bin liner for the base and the straight side. From memory, I think I used Cellotape for sealing the joints between the base and the sides, also for sealing the side joints. It became very hot during the curing process. Subsequently I lined the curved side with 5 layers of GRP in tape layup. I drilled the holes for the attachment bolts in situ on the transom to make sure they lined up. The fitting looks pretty robust, but the test will be in use. The bronze pintle rotates within it very smoothly. I am wondering if it may tighten when immersed in water, but the opposite may occur, as the water could act as a lubricant.
