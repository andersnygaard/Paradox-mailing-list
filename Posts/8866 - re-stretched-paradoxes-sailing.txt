"Leeboards are equivalent to (actually,  better than) a deep fin if you want to tack."

I'd love to see your evidence on this.

This seems to echo the nonsense I've heard floating around that a lug sail, Gaff, Junk, etc, can point higher then a Marconi rigged high aspect ratio sloop. But hey, always open to see results, some good A-B-A or boat on boat tests would be nice.

But I understand usually when someone choses to use Leeboards they usually are not chasing high performance.
