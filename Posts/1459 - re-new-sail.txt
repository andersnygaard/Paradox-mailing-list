You have put more thought into it then I did Kjell, as I just had the sail built as Matt drew it. I think it was Al who mentioned using a piece of foam at the end of the boom laying along the foot to take up the extra sail and it is something I want to give a try. For now I am content to just take the extra sail, after furled, and stuff it below the stowed sail. It would make a neater package if it rolled up like the original and it may be worth while building the boom to do the job. It seems like you have figured out how to do it. I would think that it would be easy to make a model boom and sail to scale and see if it would work. As far as I know the new halyard position is as Matt drew it or at least meant for it to be.
