You make a good point, particularly on the fore and aft trim - thanks.

Before I launched my Paradox I had weighed it and calculated the extra ballast needed. It was not until after the fourth outing that I was finally satisfied that I had it in the right place to get the fore/aft trim right. Then I sorted out the bolting down. It didn't need to be far out to make the tacking much less certain.

With a sheet of lead you would have to be very confident you had done the balance sums right!
