That's right Bill, I bought a very heavy one from west marine. My first 
one bent and I found my self furling the main sheet as well as the sail. 
Also, I found that when the rudder is raise (it comes up in a hurry) the 
trailing edge would bang on the transom. I put a small stainless fitting 
on the top of the rudder head and then slipped a piece of rubber hose 
over it to stop the blade before it passed the rudder head.

Really nice work Bill, can't wait to see the finished product.

Nice work Bill !!!

I was looking at your pictures of the boom and have a suggestion, The main
sheet and stock topping lift tang are not strong enough they will bend
easily. I finally had to use 3 tangs bolted together to stop the bending.
I believe Glen had the same problem, not sure how he corrected his.

It's looking good Bill, keep going and you will soon be there.
