Hello Al and all,

I was thinking more along the lines of metal tanks built into the corners of the stern similar to Pete's idea.

In another favourite of mine 'Of Yachts and Men' tanks to fit the odd shapes of bilges were custom made from 20 gauge copper sheet and I just thought it suited my purposes as they could be filled from filler caps set in the rear deck and vented through the stern. The tanks would be cross linked at their base with a central draw off point coupled through independant shut off valves.

My main aim is to keep nauseous fuel odour away from the cabin.

The solution to Bill's problem of losing the cap is to drill a hole through the cap and put in a fitting with a pipe attached so fuel can be pumped in without removing the cap.

Hoping for calm nights
Al, Yeovil, England.

The supply tank would need to have a secure location and at some point in time it in turn would need to be replenished. I couldn't work out were it would go without interfering with the accommodation.
Bill.
