Subject: Re: SaSa photos

Yes, a double tillered Paradox.
I don't think that has been suggested in my reading of earlier posts.
The above deck tiller should allow the bungy cord or surgical rubber to tiller/sheet to boom self steering system (Captain Voss raw chic).
I will upload some photos showing how I tortured my beloved SaSa's behind into shape.
While I'm rabbiting on I want to suggest to the Paradox builder/owners how about water bladders in the water holds. The holds don't have baffles, 70lbs of water/ballast lolling back and forward, this way and that and making splooshing sounds when you're trying to get to sleep? The water might be better contained in a number of bladders (include their own taps) down there in the holds..
