Hi William,

My cabin is not strictly according to plans. I framed the edges around the cockpit. I found some pictures - will load up. Then I built the cabin structure using stitch and glue methods. The central laminated beam is about 75 mm wide, wider than plan. The front roof of the cabin is 2 layers of 4 mm ply laminated together with lots of epoxy. On the outside of the central beam I laminated another similar beam. All the edges and corners are reinforced with extra timber. I have a sliding hatch at the back. 

The structure around the sliding hatch is built extra strong with 9 mm play and 19 mm pine epoxied on the inside. I did not add in the central knees as per plan. I have not noticed the extra weight in any way. The front part of the cabin roof will flex slightly if I put a point load on it, but it feels solid.

Hope that helps.
