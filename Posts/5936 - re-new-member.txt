Thanks Steve and Al. 

I wouldn't absolutely have to hand launch the boat. I have a road trailer and take the other boat all over, but if I can hand launch, it really enhances the use of the boat. I guess stripping out Paradox at every launch/retrieval would be a major pain. 

I see using the boat only for longer trips as I have other fast and light boats for daysailing, but I think I'll see what shakes down with the E460. Its already 400# lighter at dwl, and stripped out the weight est. was about 260#, say 300. I could manage 400# without too much trouble.

In a perfect world, I'd build a 120% Paradox (or larger) and put it in a marina. Its probably good that my shop has size limitations to keep the projects from getting out of hand. My shop is on the third floor, with an elevator that is 16 feet deep. 16.5 feet diag. is about the useful max.

Thanks again, and I have enjoyed seeing all of your boats and cruising stories.
