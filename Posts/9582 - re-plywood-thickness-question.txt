Hello, 

I wouldn't put outside bottom stringers on it. You'd only do that with a light thin bottomed boat. Paradox is anything but light. It's as heavy as hell! Apart from the additional drag (the chine runners already create plenty of that), the outside bottom stringers would make it much harder to winch the boat onto your trailer.

The way I think about my Paradox is she's a miniature keeler, not a dinghy. Contemplate your build with that in mind.

I've beached mine many times, but as time goes on, I prefer to anchor out. While the heavily fiber glassed bottom can take it, it's humans I'm worried about. Leave it beached and you're inviting vandalism.

The water ballast tanks as per plan work fine. I've never yet had the need to drink out of them as I always take potable water in separate plastic bottles, but if push came to shove, I'd drink out of them now, as the epoxy has been cured for at least a couple of years.
