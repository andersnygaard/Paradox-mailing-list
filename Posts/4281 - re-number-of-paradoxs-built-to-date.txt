Glenn,

Thanks! My days off fall on Friday's and Saturday's. It will probably be May before I can take any more time. I'm a preacher and it's hard for me to get away on a Sunday, but I may be able to work something out. Man you really did a great job on Zoe. I've been reading about her and drooling since you first posted her photos.
