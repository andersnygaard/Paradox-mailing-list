Here's another video https://youtu.be/olMLbn-i54k from my favourite sailing spot, Lake Ellesmere in New Zealand.

Something interesting, I noticed on that trip. The sheet passing across the rear of the rudder cheek acts as a kind of tiller lock. However, if you raise the clew of the boom for any reason (this applies to both the sprit rig and the Mk I standing lug) then the sheet is more likely to end up dragging over the upper gudgeon where it is prone to jam. I'm considering making the rear of the rudder cheek more concave at the height of the sheet entry hole, with a distinct notch below the upper pintle that will capture the sheet rather than letting it pass over the upper gudgeon. Due to my use of a sprit rig I'll be able to change to having a block on the transom sheet attachment point and thereby gain double rather than single purchase on the sheet.
