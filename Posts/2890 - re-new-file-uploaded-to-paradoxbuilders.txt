You could put it on one of my sites.  One of my web development clients runs his own server and doesn't get charged for bandwidth so he doesn't charge mer.  You can put it there until he tells me to take it off ... :)

All your arguments for not posting the file on  web site are fine, but I still say what's wrong with uploading it to a web site and posting the URL here like everyone else does?  Then everyone can download it and use it -- without going thru all the hassles you're suggesting.
