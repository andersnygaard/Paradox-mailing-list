I just uploaded my CAD drawing for the sides of Gorfnik.  I am still waiting for any further details on this interesting combination of a Puddle Duck Racer and a Paradox.

As far as I can tell, this boat will take 2 sheets of 1/4 inch plywood for the sides and airboxes.  Another full sheet of 3/8 inch (possibly 1/4") plywood for the bottom and another sheet of 1/4" plywood for the decking.

I haven't figured up how much plywood will remain from main hull to build the front and rear ends as well as the rear storage space and actual cabin covering.

Unlike the Oz versions of the PDRacer, this one IS still class legal so you could register it on the PDR website as soon as it is 3D.  With a little pre-planning (to add the extra support pieces inside the airboxes), I can imagine this boat being built as a simple PDRacer and then add the cabin after playing with it (I mean testing it).

I don't know when (or even IF) I will start building this interesting design but I am still very interested in it and will likely continue to work out all the details as I get time.
