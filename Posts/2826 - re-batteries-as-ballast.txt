I just read today in an article about Lance Armstrong that the average cyclist in good shape can put out 200 watts for 20 minutes.(Lance can do 500 for twice that)

with a conversion multiplier of .00134 , that comes to about .27 hp

Of course, that's on an efficient machine, and it's only for 20 minutes, and it's with leg and torso  power, and there is probably no beer gut involved----

I dunno- half that?

That sounds reasonable.....so an in shape cyclist might be at the 1/6 hp  
level give or take for continous operation with leg power

So, it would stand to reason that just arm power is gonna be even less than that...

Now, what would be slick would be a mechanical rig with an nice relatively  big slow turning efficient prop that you could peddle in your little micro cruiser when needed.....and if you made it really slick, you could carry two  (probably smaller diameter) bicyle tires and snap together a bicyle when you pulled into the marina!

No reason it couldnt be done and still kept relatively light weight....but  it would take a good bit of mechanical "genius" to be practical...

Dont dismiss that beer gut too much now....its emergency flotation,  cushioning, and insulation ALL rolled into one :)

take care
