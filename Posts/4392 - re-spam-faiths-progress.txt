Subject: Re: [SPAM] 'Faith's' Progress

Thanks for the encouragement. I attached the front window and I'm in the middle of painting the decks. The weather has turned for the worst with rain forecast for the next few days. I need to take the boat to my front lawn where she can be turned over on her side for applying the antifouling which is the copper type for trailer sailers and boats that dry on moorings. I also need to fair the sides and paint them. After that, it's a matter of attaching fittings and rigging the boat. Oh, I forgot; I need to fit a more substantial bolt through the rudder and the stock. There are the other small jobs to be done before she can be launched.

Cheers,
Bill.
