Subject: Glen in the Azores

My spy sent me the following:

"Glen on Tao Zao has arrived by 2130. We were all having dinner at Zodiaco restaurant on the bar building in front of the marina. I saw a small mast coming in and alerted them and they literally jumped from their chairs into the street and started to shout to each other in ecstasy. We rushed to pay the bill and rushed back to marina to welcome him.
Pedro"

Well done Glen. The firrst junk rigged boat in and after a hard beat for the last few days......

In general, this year's event was very tough with plenty of rough weather and more than enough headwinds.

Best,
Jim
