In the opinion of current owners, is there room in the design of Paradox for there to be batteries, in addition to (or rather than) water or lead pigs as ballast?

I ask because batteries are ridiculously heavy. Every time I think about adding lead to a boat, I can't help but figure that it makes sense to chuck the godawful heavy things in instead.

Another factor, is that there are some excellent marine electric engine options out there nowadays. I can't help but feel that there is room in the design for a modest electric propulsion engine (inboard, outboard) vs. the idea of fuel and an outboard which seems to be the current way to go. Electric is also quiet!

As for fumes and ventilation, good AGM batteries could make up for this. There are numerous sizes and designs. A small ventilation system could be incorporated into the current system as well.

As far as ballast, it would still be quite necessary to have plenty on hand to adjust as needed, but Paradox carries quite a bit so I imagine that wouldn't be a problem if the right measurements and thought went into it.

Stupid idea?

I hope not, as it is what I have done. I have fitted an 80AH AGM battery (12kg) just forward of bulkhead 3 where it sits nicely in the gap between the water tank and the side. It sticks up into the living space, but doesn't get in the way. I use it to drive a small trolling motor which will push me about 8 miles at 2 knots. The motor is normally stored inboard (beware of proximity to compass). I have used it only rarely as I prefer to use the yuloh for short distances, but when I have used it I have been very glad to have it.

Of course it powers/charges all my other electronics as well.

Hoping for calm nights
