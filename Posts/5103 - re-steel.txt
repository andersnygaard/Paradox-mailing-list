Thanks Steve. 
You have built a Paradox? 
Alberto

Hello Alberto,

I have some books all about building steel sailing boats. The minimum size thickness steel should be 3.5 mm thick, low carbon steel. When finished it should be sandblasted and epoxy coated to stop the rust. You can expect many people to be negative towards steel for boats. 
Good luck.
