Subject: Re: Tiller Rope Lock

Thank You for all your replies. I may leave this alone for now to see if a lock is really needed. The tension on the tiller rope and friction of all the parts may be something to judge during actual sailing, and motoring. It should be easy to arrange then as the proven disc brakes seem to be good.

Thanks,
