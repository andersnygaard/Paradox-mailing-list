Hello Andre. I think the information you have provided on your Paradox like boat is an excellent addition to the group. I am not the moderator here so I cannot speak for him. I do however moderate the Michalak group and I personally invite you to join that group and let the others know about your interesting new design. 

On a side note, I remember being banned from a previous Paradox group by Don Elliott. I was banned because I brought up making small changes to the Paradox design. I got the "thou shall not deviate from the designers wishes" speech. Don's group was certainly "controlled" but his group also never had the soul and diversity of the more open and inclusive group (here!). Don meant well, but his approach was limited at best and obviously failed. I hope this Paradox group can maintain an open atmosphere of discussion and inclusion so a maximum of persons can learn a diversified range of information and opinion.
