Hi Nels,

Because the bottom is 18mm ply I am thinking of taking the lap to a little more than 9 mm and using a piece of 9mm ply for the filling piece. If I was to nail it using 25mm bronze ring nails, so that they couldn't go through, the epoxy wouldn't squeeze out of the joint. What do you think of that?

Apropos taping the joint: that seems to be a useful idea for some extra strengthening.

Best wishes,
Derek
