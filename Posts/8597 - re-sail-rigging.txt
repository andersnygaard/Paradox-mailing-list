I too find that the topping lift works just fine attached to the front only.  And as I have previously mentioned, I have had some bad experiences with my former topping lift, in which the sail can get hung up when it’s flying low, which is of course during the strongest winds.  No wonder Matt Layden replied to the question of the topping lift with “I don’t think that’s a good idea...”.

As for the double pulley, I personally don’t think it’s worth the trouble of the long extra rope.  Even in tough winds, I find that I can reef easily enough by slacking the halyard 6 inches or so, and then pulling with both hands on the furling rope to pick up the slack.

Looking forward to your first comments when you get your boat wet William!
