Just uploaded a few, one pic in particular has a what looks like an outboard laying on a table, its a hand operated outboard, very cool im going to mount it tomorrow and try it out, its very light. I have some construction pics but they are locked in my laptop that needs to be reconfigured, just havent had time.
