I was thinking along the lines of a bulkhead mounted oil lamp with a brass funnel and flue above. I've seen this set up vented into a dorade box on deck. Im not sure if there actualy enough  room on a Paradox main bulkhead, or  how best to mount and fabricate a 1" charlie nobel.   When and if I build one of these boats I will be trying to sort this out with an Aladin mantle lamp.
