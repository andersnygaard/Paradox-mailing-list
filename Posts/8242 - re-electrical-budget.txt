Hi Jim,

Excellent! Good find. :-)

Read the first three chapters together. The explanation of course stability is very valuable. He made a lot of things make sense that didn't before, for me.

My memory of sheet-to-tiller arrangements as Letcher describes are that the number of sails isn't relevant. Select an appropriately loaded sheet from which to take tiller inputs. If you only have one sheet, then you arrange your connection so a suitable reduction or amplification of that input is applied to the tiller.

It's a really good read. I'm sure you'll enjoy it.

Matt
