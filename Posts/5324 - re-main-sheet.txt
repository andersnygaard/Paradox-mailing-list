Subject: Re: Main sheet

The Mainsheet detail is on Dwg. 1, in the lower righthand zone. There is (on Dwg. 11) another rope, along the tiller, for lifting the rudder blade. The third line in the vent box is because Zoe has a topping lift. This line holds the boom up off the deck during the furling of the sail. Some have added it to their boats. Steve Yahn
