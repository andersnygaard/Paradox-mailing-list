you might try a wind-sail. I have used them and they are far more efficient than your elbow, and easier to stow and less likely to be forgotten..
basically it is two pieces of fabric sewn into a + where the bottom fits to your opening and the top is held up with perhaps the haliyard or something. the X or + allows the wind to blow into your space from any wind direction and the catchment is how big you make it. perhaps for your 4 inch opening you might have a catchment 2 feet high and as wide as you want.
if you are unsure what I mean let me know, I could try to draw it up but do not have time now.

Subject: [paradoxbuilders] A Temporary Summertime Vent Scoop

In anticipation of anchoring out this summer I thought I would do something to get a scooping action for the forward vent. A 4 inch pipe size elbow has an outside diameter of 5 inch. Just the same size as my vent hole. I got it at the hardware store for about 5 dollars. I ground a sleight taper onto one end to get a tight fit. I just smack it with my fist to seat it in. I can not leave in in permanently because it gets in the way of the tack strop. So I will only install it while at anchor. In the summertime any increase is venting and cooling is well worthwhile.
