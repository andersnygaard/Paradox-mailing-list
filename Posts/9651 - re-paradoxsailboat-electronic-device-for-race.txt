Thank you, I will look at that better when I get home. I believe the problem with having a short boat race with a prize against people in different areas is you cannot protect against cheating. That is what I realized with the first race I tried to do and I now understand it to be the hurdle to overcome. I am not sure how involved it would be to build us an app specific for remote races with our paradoxes. I work in a place with computer engineers and I have been waiting for one of them to wake up all night so I can ask them about this. Maybe we could hide anti cheating detection within the phone app based on the unique movement of a paradox possibly comparing it to wind conditions at the time etc. vibration detection for motors, sudden movement to detect towing. At the same time this app would feed info back so spectators could see who is winning.
