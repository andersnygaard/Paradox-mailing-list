The only reason I am looking for bigger is because I am planning an Atlantic crossing. I will need 1 other person and much more stores and fresh water, more than paradox can carry for 30 days for 2 people.

Good point, Sighting the Vasa. She went turtle and became a submarine.

I have thought about a bigger paradox but, I thought why mess with a good thing. And if I may add, it would be easer to lead a nomadic life with the original size boat, Having to tow it around.  Anyway good luck with your project. 

Good sailing.

My interpretation is that 4.2 meter boat on a drawing should build to 4.2 meter in reality.

Its not rocket-science to design a boat, but there is quite a number of details to fit together. And they affect each other in not so obvious ways.

The designer has already done considerably thinking on how things like length, weight, sail-area and so on, will fit together.

This boils down to the chicken and egg problem. If you do know how to modify a design you already have what it takes to make your own design. So why bother "scaling"?

So for the rest of us, including myself, stick to plan!
