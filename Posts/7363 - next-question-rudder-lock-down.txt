Subject: Next Question - rudder lock-down??
Date: Wed, 27 Feb 2013 15:33:19 -0000

OK I am installing the rudder. It is weighted as it is supposed to be....and there is a v groove on top for the line to lift it. How about keeping it down??  Are you guys finding just the weight is enough to keep it from trailing back?  Seems like if I have the nut loose enough to allow it to fall....it swings so easy that I can't see how it would not swng back as the boats speed increases. Are you guys doing anything to keep it in the "Down" position?
