My Fellow Paradox Builders...

I have just posted the pics of the past couple of days work...and ENDEAVOUR is finally starting to resemble the PARADOX that she truly is! Today I prepared all the bulkheads to receive the sheer clamp and pretty much finished up most of the "peanut buttering" of the bulkheads. Now we are ready to go back and fiberglass tape those PB joints and once the sheer clamp is in, we can roll her over and start on the bottom. These are fun times here at the ENDEAVOUR Yard.

Once again I must acknowledge the extreme gratitude that I have for my uncle, Mr. William Johnston. His enthusiasm for this project is a tremendous driving factor to its success thus far. I hope that each and every Paradox builder out there has at least one person supporting them the way he has supported me in this build....till next time....

Safe Passages To All,
Greg
