How long do you think you'll be afloat for and where are you going Bill?

I'm hoping to have a few more days afloat in 'Faith' somewhere along the South Coast during the second half of next week. Will be launching in either Poole or Chichester areas - not quite decided yet, so could we run into each other?

Best
