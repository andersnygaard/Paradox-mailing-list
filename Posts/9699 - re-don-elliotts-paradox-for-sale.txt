Hello Paradoxians,

Yes, Don Elliott's Edge paradox boat is back on the water. I thought I would update this thread so those wondering about the boat can be in the know. I believe Don's boat was one of the early built boats... @1996.

I painted the outside last year and the inside this year. Last year I sailed on the Chesapeake with guys who are The Shallow Water Sailing Club. It was my first time out in that bay with the boat as I usually sail in the fresh water lakes of New York.

I am very grateful to have acquired Don's boat.
