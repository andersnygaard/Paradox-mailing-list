Thanks Glen,

I'm off for a week in "Whisper". I'm trying to figure my Fuel consumption. Unfortunately were I sail I must have a motor. I figured she would do over 5 Knots from previous trips using my 4 hp motor. I must admit, she motors like she was built as a power boat.

Hi All,

the normal numbers would be 1.3 times the square root of the waterline length or 1.3 X 3.663 =3D 4.76 kts (5.4 mph). It is not unusual for sharpies to sail much faster. On my trip to Clearwater while broad reaching about 6 miles offshore in winds of 12- 15 kts and seas 2-3 ft under full sail I saw GPS readings of 5.9 - 6.1 kts for about two hours until the wind died down, the GPS recorded a max speed for that leg of 6.3 kts. At one point I hardened up on the wind to see what she would do while smashing into the seas and the best I could do was 4.7 kts. All and all not to shabby for a 13'5" water line length.

Hi All,

Has anybody done the numbers on hull speed? what is the formula?
