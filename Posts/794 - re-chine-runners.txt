My paradox is plans built, CE, with no modifications except the addition of a topping lift to make sail furling easier. The stove is not gimbaled in the pitch plane as there is very little pitching and I fear that if it ever got so bad that I couldn't cook on it I would not have much of an appetite any way. :o)
