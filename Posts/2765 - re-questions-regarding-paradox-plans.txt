I wonder if the dimensions change at all with the new sail Matt specs of Paradox?

The spar sizes are the same for both sail plans. If you go with the up dated plan you will be able to cut off about 8" of the boom if memory serves but don't do it until the sail has been installed and the boom measured against it. I have had both sail plans on Zoe and if it wasn't for the fact that the first was too flat, I may still be using it. It is for sale to anyone wanting to have some more draft put into it.

Thanks Glen, I'll keep that in mind.

Have you taken a look at the drawing of the new sail in the files section? Is it accurate? (I think it is, because the drawing shows you could cut the boom 8.5 inches with the new sail plan--agreeing closely with your 8 inch estimate.) It looks like the mast could be 4-4.5 inches shorter, if the drawing is correct.

Not a big deal, and you would certainly want to build it according to the plans first, but I wouldn't mind losing another 4 inches of mast height (considering windage and weight) if it works with the new sail plan.
