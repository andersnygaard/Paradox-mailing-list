I agree also, 3/8 th is a lot of steel, way way way too much. 1/8th inch is equivalent to 1 1/2 mahogany wow.

I think the most important part is arriving at the same balance as with wood, and LOADED to arrive at the same weight same CG, I think this can be achieved as Bill had said the box shape lends itself to the material. I agree we need the data for steel. I think we will find we get more storage space and capacity. I have access to a fab shop, I repair his welders and he owes me :) Hope he has a plasma cutter. At least he's got a decent shear, but the curved stuff might need to use an air chisel or something.

I made a mistake in my previous post. The Bolger design in 1/8" steel plate. And he claims it is equal in weight to 11/2 inch mahogany.

Would be great to get some weight estimates with 1/10" and 1 inch tubing for the chines and deck beams and clamps? Would it not tend to oil can on the bottom - or would it be heavier plate?

Sounds interesting.
