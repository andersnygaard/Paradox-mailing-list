Well done Glen, just what we need. I am in the UK and am about to order the wood and epoxy (next week I hope). The photos are splendid, and the boat looks great. How long has it taken so far? I don't half envy you your workshop, I shall be building in a garage that is only 2 ft longer than the finished boat. I am putting a lot of thought into the logistics so that I get as much as possible done before the hull goes together.

Come on the rest of you, how many are building (or thinking of) out there?
Hoping for calm nights
