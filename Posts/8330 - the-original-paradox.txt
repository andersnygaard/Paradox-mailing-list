Hello,

I was wondering how the original Paradox, which is now over 22 years old, is looking. I seem to recall that the builder did not use marine grade ply and I am not sure if he glassed the sides. It saw a lot of use. Does Dave Balduc have it? What about other older Paradoxes? How are they holding up? Have any been retired?

Thank you.
