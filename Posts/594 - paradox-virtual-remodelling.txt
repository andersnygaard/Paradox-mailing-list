My virtual remodeling of Paradox using photoshop... :)

It is based on a picture of whisper (hope you dont mind).
and is in the Photos folder.

My idea was to make Paradox less of a "Wall" to big 
waves crashing on the "english-word-for-back-of-the-boat" 
(might be the stern but I'm not sure...)

Any comment on this modification is welcome :)
