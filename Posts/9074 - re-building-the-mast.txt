Subject: Re: Building the mast

Hi Aman,

Spending time on your computer is going to get you NO CLOSER to building your boat. You WILL understand the plans as soon as you begin cutting and gluing timber. Trust me, you need to start NOW, otherwise the boat will never happen. There are lots of people on this list who can answer any questions you have as you go along and the list archive is a treasure trove of information. I think just about every question relating to constructing a Paradox has already been asked sometime in the past.

I think it's an excellent idea to start with the components now and do the hull later on. When you're nearing the end of your build and getting frustrated at how long it's taking, knowing that those bits are already done, makes it much less of a mission. Some of the components are tiny. The lower gudgeon for the rudder cheek is pretty small. The roller furling hoop likewise. The rudder cheek and the rudder can also be made now. The yuloh, mast, boom, and yard too and you can store those in the roof of your garage until needed.

Cheers,

Rob.
