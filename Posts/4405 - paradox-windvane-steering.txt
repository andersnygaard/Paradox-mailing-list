Glen,

I note Zoe was sporting her new windvane steering gear at Cedar Key. I'm intrigued how it works. Is there any chance you could make drawings of the gear for other Paradox owners?

How do you manage the mounting when the boom extends so far aft of the transom? Some close-up photos would be great.

Cheers,
Bill.

PS. Today I finished 'Faith's' hatch which has a very large Polycarbonate window that will give me a clear view of the sail; it will also allow sunlight to shine on the solar panel which is mounted on cabin roof.
