I've built 25 ft boat and I can assure you there was less work building her than the Paradox I am currently building. Costs for Paradox are only marginally less than the bigger boat.

I started building my Paradox around August of last year and I don't think I shall finish until the summer of 2007.

It could be different if one were building the boat professionally on a full-time basis, but even then I doubt it could be done in under 6 months, with all the power tools a professional may have.
