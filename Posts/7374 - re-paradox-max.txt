I understand. But'm shipbuilder and often receive inquiries from people who do not like or know built sailing, but want to start modifying a project that took several years to reach the spot. Boats things always seem easy to be modified, when the reality is quite different. Increasing the size of Paradox could be worth another look most appropriate design needs. Unless time and money is not an obstacle, or even the risk of creating something unsafe.
That's only because I deal with a board boats for over 40 years. Every thing that you modify on a boat, is reflected in all the others. It has good larger projects. If you increase 30 cm in Paradox, but gives little benefit means a considerable increase in volume that will require a considerable increase in sail area, ballast for little benefit. think about it
