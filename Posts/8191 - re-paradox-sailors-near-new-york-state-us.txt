Hi Rob, 

Thank you for sharing your approach to building the part prior to the boat:

"Mast head light, mast, yard, yuloh, boom, lower gudgeon, stainless steel tack downhaul, stem, rudder cheek, rudder, bulkheads 3, 1, 4, transom, 2, deck beams, bulkhead 2 mast step, scarf and join sides."

I think that I shall start with the yard and the connectors for it. The yard appears to have a taper to it so I suspect it is best to create the center line to drill into its end for the copper pipe insert before making and shaping to the wood.

This approach will get me some practice on working with wood, measuring, reading the plans correctly and Don's book comprehensively. I have to make some phone calls to places that sell quality wood in this area.

Best,
Deric
