Subject: Re: The day things went wrong

I'm looking at the Southern Ocean from the West Coast of South Australia
The waves are big , the harbours are in some cases tricky and the gap between them is more than a day sail , I'll need a lot more messing about in my boat before venturing offshore here
Hired a 14 foot open boat yesterday to check out the entrance to Venus Bay , it was scary looking from an open punt . Would have rather been in my Paradox for sure .
Hope someone is out there sailing right now
