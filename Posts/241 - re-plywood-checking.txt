Hi Mike,

I'm not overly concerned about "Zo=EB's" interior checking because I keep her inside and well vented, however I personally would not use AC exterior fir ply again both because of the checking problem and the time required to get a nice finish on a boat that I want to last awhile and intend to put some time into. I doubt that I would even use Marine fir ply again because of checking problem. There are very good marine plywoods out there such as gaboon and mahogany that do not check coated or not. A good source for them is Harbor at 800-345-1712. For interior bulkheads and shelving I would recommend MDO or HDO coated both sides and fir is fine here. When the project is completed you will find that the cost of even very good plywood is a very small percentage of the overall cost and you can save by buying good ply and skipping all the epoxy and glassing on the inside. If given reasonable care you can even skip the glassing on the out side if you use the good stuff but it won't take knocking around as well.

That said, If you want to throw together a "proof of concept" boat, even a well proven design that you just want to see if it is right for you, I would use exterior AC, pretreated using Dave Carnell's method and just paint with house paint also following his recommendations and have at it. I would not be surprised to hear that such a boat lasted 10 yrs or more even though it was built as a disposable boat. I intend to throw together a small dinghy just so and throw it out side to see how long it would last.

Hope all this rambling helps.

Tailwinds,
Glen
