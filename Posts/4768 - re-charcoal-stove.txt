Hi Here is one simalar but my one has a narrower flue, more pot 
belied so to speak! this one could be mde top loading I reckon of 
courseyou would discard the bbQ top section and relce with flue 
adapter, mine has 2 doors rather than the one on his one.

Hi
I have a pot bellied BBQ with a diameter of about 6" and a flue dia 
of 3" which would possibly do? 
The door is about 4 x 3" square, and I am sure a flue could easily 
be made up to fit, the legs bolt off as I remember so the height 
would be less than 12" just a thought. 
Any diy store woud have them for =A320 or as would ebay. 
Yours James
Ps, what are the main constituent elements of the paradox series 
design?
I have done ome thinking;- 
1) Inside sailing position, 
2) internal ballast,
3) simple lug rig, 
4) Chine runners,
5) heavy displacement (except enigma)
