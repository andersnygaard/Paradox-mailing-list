The Cachivache was modified making them shorter and more wide, and following the shape of the hull left with a downward tilt.
I've noticed that hold up much better direction and turns with ease, and is more sensitive rudder to maneuver.

Subject: [paradoxbuilders] Best shape for Chine Runners?

A search of "chine runners" yields 496 messages on this site alone, so maybe someone can help me sort this out.

In later designs it appears the chine runners have become shorter, straighter, and wider than in the Paradox.

Does anyone know if Matt has come to any conclusions as to whether that actually improved performance? 

If it did, there may be further gains possible by continuing on with that trend. Of course it can only be carried so far for practical purposes. I think the maximum would look something like a shark's pectoral fin, but squared off on the end.

The shorter fin would work better as a foil itself, but on the other hand there would be less of the hull side in way of the fin. Also, a wider fin may increase the heeling moment if carried to far.

It would be very interesting to have a one-design fleet of these with removable chine runners that could be exchanged and modified.

Thanks,
Nathan
