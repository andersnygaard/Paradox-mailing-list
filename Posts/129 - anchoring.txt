Subject: Anchoring.

Hi,

I'm finding it very hard to get to the Bow of my PARADOX with an anchor and rode in flat calm water, I feel it would be down right dangerous in any kind of weather. I was thinking about rigging something up so the anchor could be deployed and recovered from the safety of cabin. Any Ideas?

Thanks,

David Beard
