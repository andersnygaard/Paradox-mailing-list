I started drawing Paradox in cad a few days ago and I have a couple questions about dimensions, bulkhead deck curves and bulkhead openings

Leave the deck beams a bit oversize and trim to fit on the deck trial fit.

Due to the fact that the whole boat is massively strong, small changes like you propose for the b'hd openings will not be a problem.

If you follow the building method of doing a trial fit (without glue) before each major component is fitted then everything must fit (though it may not be exactly as drawn. I too made a cad model before I started construction. The trouble with cad is that you need to know all the exact measurements. In real life there is quite a lot of flexibility and a few mm here or there don't matter.
