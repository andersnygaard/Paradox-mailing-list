Wow! Life has thrown me a curve.... looks like I will be leaving the west coast for Florida. It is too long a story and not right for this forum but the short of it is the other person (Donna) in my life says Venice Beach is too Cold. We have been together for 15 yrs...not officially married, we are about to separate as very good friends. (plutonic relations for last 9 yrs.) I am going to help her get to Florida first.... and since I wanted to live there eventually anyway, I am probly gonna stay there too.

So we are looking to move to Tampa or someplace similiar within the next 8 months and it looks like I will be finishing my paradox there. I have completed bulkheads 1 and 2, cut out the other bulkheads and have a partially finished yuloh and mast. Hoping to make the Bahamas for 2010!!!
