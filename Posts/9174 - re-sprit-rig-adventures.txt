This list seems awfully quiet, yet it's the height of summer in the northern hemisphere. Surely, there's quite a few of you getting out on the water. Join me and post some videos of what you're doing!

Here's another one I've just made. This overnight sail was to test out how cold it can be and still be comfortable in a Paradox. When I woke up in the morning there was frost on the ground. I was a little cold (forgot to take my hot water bottle), but I think the main problem was my back rather than the temperature. There was condensation all over the windows in the morning, but the air was dry inside. When I'm sleeping I can feel a very light draught passing over the top of my face, so just the right amount of air comes in the tiller hole and exits through the vent box.

The only downside I've come across in the cabin design is the cooker position. It lies beneath the main sheet. No problem when cooking. The issue is that the main sheet is wet. When it is hauled in while sailing, most of the moisture is removed passing through the main sheet entry hole in the transom, but not all of it. Some still ends up dripping on the edge of cooker. Not a problem with fresh water, but not so great with salt water.

The edge of the transom baffle also receives a lot of abrasion when loading and unloading the mast, spars and yuloh. I put one layer of fiberglass tape there in anticipation of wear, but not nearly enough. It needs serious beefing up, perhaps with a layer of tin.

But these are minor problems. The more I sail Mini, the happier I am with her. I really recommend sailing without a motor too. You become a much better sailor without the fall-back of a motor.

Cheers,
Rob.
