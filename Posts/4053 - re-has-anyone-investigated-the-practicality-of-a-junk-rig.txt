The Paradox rig reefs easily, is controlled during a gybe and has good windward performance. The Chinese lug rig would have to have some pretty compelling features to make it worth changing.

Would a Chinese lug not have more sail forward of the mast? If so wouldn't the mast have to be moved aft to keep the boat in balance?

Does a Chinese lug not have to have sheets coming aft from the battens?. The existing Paradox sail extends behind the transom so you would either need some sort of bumkin or else move the centre of effort even further forward ruining the existing almost perfect balance.

Would a Chinese lug rig stow on the side deck as the designed sail does, or would it be left swinging about above your head (and getting in the way when you stand up) on the topping lift?

So to partly answer your question, it has never occurred to me that a Chinese lug rig would be superior to the designed rig. I am a fan of the Chinese lug, but not on this boat.
