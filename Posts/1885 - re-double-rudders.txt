How would you go about heaving-to in a paradox?

I am still of the opinion that there could be great benefit to those
who use Paradox as a coastal cruiser by using a suitable windvane
system.  It's a matter of sorting out how it can be done.
Sven seems to have worked out a system with his 'special' rudder
setup.  Perhaps that's the answer for Paradox?

Cheers,
