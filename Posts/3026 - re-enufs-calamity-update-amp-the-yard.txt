Subject: Re: Enuf's Calamity Update &amp; the Yard

Just about 4" at the top (&amp; where the boom rubs). When sailing reefed the yard is rarely rubbing in the same place twice (and only on the port tack) so I have had no problem there. My mast is epoxy and paint (but slowly becoming bare epoxy).

I don't sail much reefed. When the wind gets strong enough to need a reef (top end of F4) I am generally looking for a quiet corner.

How is the PJ and Linseed applied? Let us know how you get on.

Did you sleeve the entire length of the mast? I had thought of that but I really like the wooden stick look. I had no problem with bare epoxy... I have heard that alot use the petroelum jelly and linseed oil to avoid this. Most of this damage happened when reefed in and in strong wind, so the yard was about 1/3 of the way up. hopefully I will get out this week or weekend to try it out.
