Further to my response on my blog.
I've tried anchoring from the stern  and it's ok if the conditions are really quiet. If there are any waves and wind you get some splashing coming in through  the aft vent / tiller hole, or, I least I did before I blocked it off with sheet rubber. And some noise  from the waves.

Better to anchor from the bow, which you can do while standing in the cabin if you have a 6 ft boathook.

I concur with Al that in normal conditions yawing at anchor is only slight . Also agree about taking the mast down when in gales. I've known the boat heel significantly when lying with the gale abeam due to the windage of the mast

Best
