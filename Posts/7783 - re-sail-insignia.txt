Subject: Re: Sail Insignia....

I saw two earlier that i can't find. One, unfortunatly trademarked, combined the ying yang with the black swan. The other was a beautiful one of a swan in flight. It would have been simple enough to convert it to a black silhouette.

I expect one of two things to happen. Either nothing, or Matt. will look at these, something will click, and he will jump in a totally different direction.

Regardless, it's an interesting diversion until the weather warms up a little. It's been running near or actually below zero here at night for the last few days -- to cold to even start squaring the garage away for such a project.

Sean, I have a question for you. In the last picture you posted of Scout, it looks more like you are WEARING that boat than sitting in it. I don't know if it is due to the camera focal length or not, but just how big are you?  I'm curious because it would give me a better feel for how I would fit. I'm a bit of a freak, with a six-footer's torso on legs with a 27" inseam, all scaled to EEEEE wide feet -- think of a less rough-hewn Gimli. :)
