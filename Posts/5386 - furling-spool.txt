Subject: Furling spool

I'm thinking about something I read somewhere about the spool on the front of the boom. To make the furling action work better there is the suggestion to build-up the diameter above that of the boom itself. This will result in less line tension needed to roll up the sail. But just how to build it up is what I'd like to learn from you guys with finished boats. A wooden doughnut, split in half and then glued or screwed on, is what I'm looking at. It has lots of fiberglass right now for strength. There must be some way to do what Matt does, and that's the way I want to go too.
