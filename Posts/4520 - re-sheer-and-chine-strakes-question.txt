I knew at the start that the beveling should always be done after the installation onto the plywood sides. This is just as you suspected. The angles are slightly different all along the length. Every single idea on the plans is not always going to agree with my experiance or even sometimes common sense. I think most builders would agree. The big fundamentals ideas are what I admire about the design. Cheers, Steve Yahn
