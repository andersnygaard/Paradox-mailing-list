Subject: Re: The Paradox Boat Building Manual

I ordered the booklet and got the PDF files by E-mail in less than a day.  I also ordered the plans from Dave Bolduc (http://www.microcruising.com/)  I just E-mailed him and got the ordering information then used PayPal to send him the $40 for the plans.  I still don't know when or if I will build a Paradox boat but as someone else said, It looks like a lot of the information in Don's building manual will be helpful even if I don't build this particular boat.
