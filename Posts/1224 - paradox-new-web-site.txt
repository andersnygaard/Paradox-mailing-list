My Paradox plans have arrived from Dave.  Many thanks.

I've subsequently added a section to the Small Sailboats web site 
about Paradox.  This has a slant towards those engaged in building 
and sailing Paradoxes in the UK.

Although the new Paradox web site is a separate entity, 
it comes under the umbrella of the Small Sailboats site.

Regards to all,
Bill.
