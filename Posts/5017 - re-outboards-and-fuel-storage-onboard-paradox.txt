Subject: Re: Outboards and fuel storage onboard Paradox

This is exactly the reason that I think electric
auxiliary power is a better option on something this
small. The stove is always going to be to close to the
outboard fuel supply for my tastes.

My idea was to replace a large amount of the useless
lead ballast with some very useful deep cycle
batteries. A small wind generator would be adequate
for charging the battery bank and the batteries could
be used for a lot more than just running the electric
outboard.

Some of the new radar system a very small and light
weight. An amateur radio for calls home. And of course
a way to keep the ever essential computer/gps
navigation system alive. 

And a small inverter and you can also have a limited
amount of AC on board for other essentials.

On something as small as the Paradox I think that
everything needs to provide some added value,
including the ballast.

When the Paradox is docked in the side yard next to
the house the wind generator and battery bank can
provide some useful backup power when needed, which is
all to often in my area.

Just my two cents worth ... Denny
