For once we have had some good gluing weather here in the UK and I have taken full advantage of it. All the spars are completed and epoxy coated (except the top of the mast where the sheave goes). 

The sides are scarfed and epoxy coated, and today I performed the trial assembly. I thought it might be a problem as I was on my own, but it was not too difficult, though I could have done with a few dozen more clamps. 

I have cut all the notches and drilled all the holes and am ready to strip it down and do it for real, however It was difficult moving round it in my garage so I think a reorganisation of the rest of the ply and wood is in order. I think I shall also complete some of the other bits first, like the rudder, while I still have room to swing a saw.

But all in all I am well pleased, a very satisfying day!

Hoping for calm nights
