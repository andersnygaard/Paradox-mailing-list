Hi David.

You might have to refit the hatch. This type of hatch should be a
little sloppy to begin with, but not so sloppy that it will wrack.

I've found adhesive backed sandpaper to be very helpful in fitting any
two pieces together. Just stick the sandpaper to the surface that is
already where you want it (like the plywood), and then slide the hatch
back and forth until it loosens up a little. With the hatch, it may be
necessary to use this trick on a few planes to assure smooth movement.
Remember that paint will add thickness, so take off enough material to
allow for the paint. 

Like Glen, I like using wax for drawer runners, hatch slides, sliding
locker doors, whatever. I like to use hard paraffin wax that you can
buy in stores for canning.

Have fun.
