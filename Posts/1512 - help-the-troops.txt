Subject: Help The Troops

I want to encourage all my friends here on Paradox Builders to support the Hero Miles program if you can. This is the program recently set up so that people with airline sky miles rewards programs can donate all or part of those sky miles to help soldiers return home to their families when on leave for free. This program has nothing to do with politics, it's just to support the troops. It's very easy to do. Go to http://www.heromiles.org/ and a few clicks later you've done it.

Happy holidays,
Bill Longyard
