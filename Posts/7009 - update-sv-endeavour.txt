My fellow Paradoxians,

It has been TOO long since my last post...but ENDEAVOUR continues to take shape.  I have at long last procured a much needed digital camera so I can finally share her with you all.  My project for today is taking,uploading and posting pictures of what is going to be IMHO a rather nice vessel.  As October blows in here I hope to have her assembled into a 3-D hull by months end.  This will be rather easy as I have built all the intricate pieces that are needed to really get some serious boat building accomplished once her hull is fabricated.

I would also like to take this opportunity to welcome new group member Mr. William Johnston.  Mr Johnston is an accomplished aircraft and boat builder with several completed builds to his credit and his work is very good...but I may be biased as he is also my uncle.  He became interseted in the PARADOX once I began construction on ENDEAVOUR and now he is my number one fan as far as cheering me on when my work slows down...he and I both want the same thing, to see ENDEAVOUR #1) completed, #2) launched, and #3) sailing off into the sunset....if any of you have the chance, drop him a line and welcome him...he  will be bringing a lot of experience, ideas, and encouragement to our group.

My next post will contain photos!

Until next time...

Safe Passages To All...Greg
