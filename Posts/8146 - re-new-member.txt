Thanks for that link Terry, I've not seen that before. The newspaper doesn't really give enough information for us to know what happened. It says that the boat capsized - does that mean that it stayed inverted, or that it was briefly knocked down and afterwards recovered....

Presumably the boat was still afloat and later salvaged after the skipper was lifted off by helicopter. 

Perhaps Geoff will pop up on here to give us all the low-down.

Best,
Jim
