Subject: Re: TARDIS for sale

I am asking $3000 for TARDIS. She just needs to be rigged. The trailer was modified to fit her perfectly. Anyone interested in her should call or text me: Lezlie 832-859-8416

Her build can be viewed on my blog: lezliesworld.blogspot.com and click on the "paradox" category to the right.
