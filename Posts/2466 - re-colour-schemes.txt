Hi Chris

Thanks for these thoughts.

Looking at the colour wheel Green is the opposite (complimentary?) colour to red and I already have a red sail. I chose red because I read that it is far better than white for showing up against the sea and in bad weather, Heaven forbid that I should be out in bad weather!

The supplier of the epoxy insists that their colour powder is all that is required to protect the epoxy from UV degradation. I thought that it was an astounding claim and phoned to check it.

So, is it to be red sail and green hull? Any other designers/good eye for colourists out there?

Thanks ...Derek
