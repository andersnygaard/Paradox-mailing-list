More ballast is more better! Paradox is a cruising sharpie; therefore, she benefits from being loaded up to her cruising waterline. The addition of a crew member would most likely improve the performance in most cases since the chines will dig in deeper. I've sailed Matt Layden's Paradox with three of us onboard, and I never really noticed any difference; though, it was getting a bit crowded below. I've also sailed Little Cruiser with three and observed the same nice sailing characteristics. I think you got to remember that these boats aren't some planing racing design where the addition of an extra crew member adversely effects performance. These sharpies sail at displacement speeds and carry their cruising loads well.

Hi all,

I am new on this thread and liked boat since childhood. I live in the Philippine Islands. I want to know more about sailing in particular the Paradox. My question, how does it perform if there are two persons onboard?

Thanks for the input.

Phil
