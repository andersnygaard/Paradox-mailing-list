Jeff,

I would add that in the ideal situation there could be an advantage 
in dividing the washboard into two parts, an upper and lower section 
which allows the option of having half of the companionway closed by 
sealing it off with the lower washboard.  There should be an 
overlapping flange along the outside of the lower edge of the upper 
board to act as a seal against water and wind when both boards are in 
place.  Two half size washboards can more easily be stored below 
decks than a single large washboard.  Another advantage of dividing 
the washboard into two parts is that not so much distance is required 
between the upper edge of the top board and the underside of the boom 
as would be required for a larger single washboard.

I've used the double washboard setup to good advantage on some of my 
boats.  With the Hunter 19 I made a small window in the upper section 
to let me see astern when sealed inside against the elements.

Bill.
