Subject: Re: big guy in a small boat

I would be reluctant to tow a drogue from the rear, as there is a hole in the transom where the tiller comes through. I have noticed that, when landing on a beach, even small waves slapping against the transom cause water to come in. This is not a problem on the beach as the volume is measured in cupfuls at most, but if it went on for 12 hours or so it would probably add up to quite a lot of water.

I have discussed this matter with Matt Layden and we agree that it would be possible to install a watertigh boot in place of the bug netting on the tiller arm (sambrella or equivalent); In this case, we should never the less have a scupper to drain the transom baffle (but this scupper could be fitted with a seacock, permitting draining only). A very severe storm could last up to 30 hours... The boat works itself up to wave speed, so there is no serious hydropistonning, until a breakingwave strikes, causing a negative 4 G impact on the boat: That's when the hydropistonning will occur for a short time. - A waps or series sea drogue is a proven method for surviving a major sea storm with a little "coastal" sharpie boat. One aspect to consider is assuring a propper anchoring of the sea drogue at each corner of the transom to resist structural fatigue on the boat and also to resist shafting of the nylon line: The  U.S. CoastGard recommends using a Genoa track on each side of the deck, to which you weld an eye at its rear extremity; It spreads the tension over a long stretch of the boat and its eye avoides any shafting of the line that does not go through a choker...
