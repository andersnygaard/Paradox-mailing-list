Hi People

Another possibility since the chine runners aren't structural and will be sheathed in glass cloth anyway, would be to use closed cell foam - the blue stuff or PVC - which could be very easily bent to fit even after fairing into shape. Anyone worried about strength could cut the bottom slightly wide to provide a bottom surface for the chines and run a fair curve the length of the hull.

Hi,

heres how I did my chine runners,

bottom was put on, left a curved shelf to start the chine runners, i 
cut out cardboard patterns of the shape at different spots, so all I had
to do was place the pattern on the boat to see if Ive got enough to 
shape the parts.... then I made small blocks 3 inches each by one inch 
or more if needed, and kinda like building a wall i glued them in place 
to make up the profile needed, then shaped them with a hand plane and 
sanded the rest , heres the reasoning behind my plan, if they get 
scuffed moisture will only enter one block, it is incapsulated in epoxy 
and wont run down the length of the chine runners and ruin the whole 
thing, they are not really structual, to having wood grain the whole 
length isnt really that important, shape is the important thing, after 
they were shaped they were sheathed in 2 oz glass, ive had the boat in 
use for a few years and no problems at all, and It was very easy to 
accomplish.

just another way to do it
