Hello Denny,

Thanks for the info, electric drive is certainly and option and I agree
that the batteries would make  great ballast.

I have been digging around on the net and found a useful yahoo group
dedicated to the subject at
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/electricboats/

I haven't had a good look yet but they have some interesting info.

My only concern would be whether solar panels would be able to keep up
with the charging demand of the batteries though I'm no expert in either
field!

Greg
