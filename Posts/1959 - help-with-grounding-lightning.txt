Subject: Help with grounding (lightning)

Hey folks, 

I'm in the process of building another boat. A bolger oldshoe with a small pilothouse and a host of non bolger sanctioned modifications. I'm setting the boat up for extended singlehanded coastal cruising and would like to ground the boat out. Wasn't going to originally, but then I decided to use extruded schedule 40 aluminum tubing for the masts, the main mast is 20+ feet tall and the mizzen isn't much shorter. Just got me thinking about summer thunderstorms and I figured why not. 

I've seen pictures of one paradox somewhere on the web with a copper sheet being laid under the glass, I'm assuming since Matt's boats are prepared for about anything, the grounding plate is part of the design. Can anyone explain how it works and what kind of wiring is involved. I've looked at some books on the subject, but I'm not building a 40' steel cutter so the info is not very useful to me except in theory.

Thanks for any info,
Jason Stancil
