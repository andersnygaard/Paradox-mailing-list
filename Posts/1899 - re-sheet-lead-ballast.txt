Al and those of you who actually have sailed Paradox,

My thoughts concerning a bottom metal sheet were to locate some of the
ballast there, about 50-70kg, the remaining for inside trimming. Matt
specifies 70-180kg total. How much would you say is needed for
one-person weekend sailing and how much for a long tour max load?

The longest trip I have done is one week, and even then I was 
eating ashore most of the time, so I suppose I have only been 
loaded for weekend sailing. I haven't changed the ballast since I got 
it set up in the spring. I have 96kg just forward of bulkhead 3 (48kg 
each side) and 24kg behind bulkhead 4.

I arrived at a figure for this much lead by weighing the boat, my 
normal equipment, myself and then made it up to 640kg. As they 
are in 12kg pigs, I should probably remove one from each side at 
bulkhead 3 if my stores got up towards 20kg.

My intention is to recheck the overall weight each spring as 
equipment tends to accumulate over the year.
