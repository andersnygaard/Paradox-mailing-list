Subject: Re: Charcoal Heater

My experience with an Aladdin mantle lamp is that they get VERY HOT.  Like hot enough to ignite things a foot or two above the glass chimney.

Besides probably being too hot for such a small space, I remember the one I had used a lot of fuel and the mantle was kind of expensive and fragile.  It did make a nice WHITE light though unlike a normal wick kerosene lamp which is a more yellow flame.

The lamps are also pretty expensive compared to regular kerosene lamps or even the pressurized lamps.

Probably safer, but less fun, would be simple hand warmers.  While they wouldn't heat the cabin, they will help keep you warm.  I have used a liquid fueled (Zippo lighter fluid) hand warmer while camping or just working outside in cold weather.  One thing the instructions won't tell you is these hand warmers CAN be run on alcohol fuel (like dry gas or denatured alcohol) although they give off a bit of a strange smell.  Not a problem outside but might not be so good sealed up inside a small boat cabin.

I'm not going to recommend this next idea but...

Of course you could just be a "fair weather sailor" and not need any potentially dangerous heaters.

I was thinking along the lines of a bulkhead mounted oil lamp with a brass funnel and flue above. I've seen this set up vented into a dorade box on deck. Im not sure if there actualy enough  room on a Paradox main bulkhead, or  how best to mount and fabricate a 1" charlie nobel.   When and if I build one of these boats I will be trying to sort this out with an Aladin mantle lamp.
