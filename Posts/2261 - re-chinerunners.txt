Coat in epoxy, it will FILL the holes, prime correctly,paint. its a known practice with steel hulled backyard builders. My observations are directed at the same. also proper maintenence will prevent these holes you speak of, also wood will do the same if not protected properly. It is not rocket science to weld correctly. perhaps others may be interested in LEARNING something.  Whats so bad about having to put a lil sweat and pride in your boat, these guys in BACKYARDS are building 40 foot plus steel boats and cruising the worlds oceans as we speak. and distortion is MOOT, this is a small boat and small welds tack move tack move, common textbook practices. to sum it up its not for everybody, but I truly think some may be interested. If nothing else Jeff its an interesting thread. 

getting back to the bronze bottom subject, bronze is not my forte, however one must beware of work hardeneing of the material when working it, ie beating it. it will cause it to become brittle.
