Subject: Regarding some of the mechanics of living and working on board a Paradox

I'd like to ask questions on how people actually live on board a Paradox, also where people store and then retrieve items.

First, what anchors do people have and use? Where are they stored? To retrieve them, how difficult is access to various storage compartments? How do people place the anchor overboard? What on deck attachment do people use for anchor lines, fore and aft?

I have seen both photographs and drawings of the stove placement in the lazarette. To use the stove, do people kneel facing aft?

What about heads? Obviously this presumably is a bucket, but how difficult is it to reach overside for emptying and washing?

I have read of some people having trouble with the hardness of the seat and how people use wheelbarrow tyres, bean bags etc. How comfortable do people find the seating position for long periods?

Thanks for your help on practical questions of actually operating a Paradox!

Regards for Christmas and New Year
