Hi Alastair,

My trailer in no good. I believe it to be a standard job for a small light weight fishing boat. Paradox needs a well built trailer. I almost lost her to the HWY on my way home from the last sail. I noticed a strap hanging loose, so I stopped to tighten it. My winch was bent up and almost pulled out, the support it was bolted was also bent and 4 or 5 teeth in the gears was broken, I was lucky. I am going to talk to Glen and see if could get the name of the place that built his trailer and maybe have one built. Nobody in my area does Boat trailers. My advice would be overbuild.

David
