Has anyone considered using deep cycle gel batteries instead of just lead for ballast and then using the added benefit of the power for an electric outboard, autohelm, and radio? 

I was thinking of a stretch (15-20%) with the extra width used to keep the main area open but wider bins on the sides with a number of batteries forward/aft of bulkhead #3 in the bottom of the bin area as ballast and a power source.
