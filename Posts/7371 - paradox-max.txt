Subject: Paradox Max

Hello,
I'm new here. Excuse my English; I am using Google Translate. I have been reading the discussion topics in this forum since December. It was a lot of work since I can only understand very little English, but I managed to translate everything using Google. My name is Gunther Battista (Bate), and I come from Austria. I am 44 years old and have no sailing experience, but I am planning to obtain a sailing license. I have the plan and instructions to build a slightly modified Paradox boat. I have read that some of you have described the boat, but it has not been built yet. I am interested in building it at 120% wholesale. My dream is to sail worldwide. It may sound crazy, but I would like to take it one step at a time. First, I need to build the boat and obtain a sailing license. Then, I plan to sail in the Mediterranean and Atlantic. I have a name for my Paradox boat, "Manatee," because I think it describes the boat as quiet and cozy. I will continue writing.
Bye,
Gunther
