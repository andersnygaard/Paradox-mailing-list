Subject: Started layout of ply ....... Ooops 

My ply was delivered on Thursday, so this weekend I started laying out the panels and bulkheads. First sheet - all ok. Second sheet - whoops, bulkhead #2 overlaps stbd side (for'd). What did it say in Dons articles? Oh yes, move the joint in the bulkhead over 50mm to 'give a better cutting clearance'. I had wondered what that meant.

So, rub it all out and start again. That's ok the bulkhead now just clears the side panel. But what's this? The transom overlaps the side panel as well. Aaagh.

That is the position at the moment. I have decided to have a rest and calm down while I think it through. The only solution that I can see at the moment is to rotate the side panel base line so that it is no longer parallel to the edge of the ply. Is this what you did (Don? Glen?) or did you not get this problem?

How close are you to launching Zoe, Glen? We want all the details.

Hoping for calm nights
