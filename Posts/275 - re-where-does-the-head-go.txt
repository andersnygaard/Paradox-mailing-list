Subject: Re: Where does the head go?

Hmmm. That's a rather sensitive topic. According to a fish I once spoke to, he swears that he saw Matt use a bucket. I think he also remarked that he heard another cruiser say "bucket and chuck it." This fish says that he onced used this same method himself without too much difficulty. The other fish didn't seem to mind either. 

Mindy and I of course wait until we reach shore, where we go to the McDonald's rest rooms. Wherever we sail to we always go to the McDonalds. No matter where, no matter how, no matter what.  

For the more civilized, a chemical head would be nice. I'm not sure how small they make them. Also, I think the official regulation roughly reads that where there is a marine head installed, it needs to be of the official type with the proper holding tank. I think a holding tank would be impractical on a boat the size of Paradox or Little Cruiser. I'm not sure if there are any regulations regarding the use of buckets. Still, if you have to use the old fashion method, you might consider putting the paper in a zip lock, and disposing of the waste when you find a trash can on shore.  

In conclusion, if you are in a crowded area or near civilization, consider using shore based facilities unless there is an emergency. I seem to have emergencies every 10 minutes when it's cold. Forget that last sentence. When you're cruising in a remote location, you may have to do like the rest of the creatures on the earth unless you can fit a chemical head aboard. Best of luck. It's a tricky one.
