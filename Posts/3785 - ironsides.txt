Subject: Ironsides

I have started my Paradox, named Ironsides. I have put up some pictures of the mods to bulkhead 3. I made the vertical web 1 1/2 inch wide to gain wider sleeping space. It is reinforced with steel weldments. Each weldment weighs 4.8 pounds. I intend to not use bins of plywood but maybe cloth bins. The steel is sealed in epoxy. The bolts are hot dipped galvanised and also assembled and sealed with epoxy. I'm now  doing the trial assembly of sides and bulkhead. The stem is character building to say the least. Wow.
