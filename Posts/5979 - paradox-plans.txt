Subject: Paradox Plans

Hi Dave,

I saw your response to Michael Urbanski on the Paradox Builder's forum. I too would like to build a Paradox and I would appreciate any information you can give me regarding plans and any building manuals, if they exist.

I'm an experienced boat builder and would like to build a Paradox next winter.

Thank you,
Rick
