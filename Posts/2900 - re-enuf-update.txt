Hi Brent,

I appreciate your concern and if I was some young woolly head without much life experience I'd reconsider. I've had a couple of experiences that might inform good 
practice; a near drowning and a couple of unexpected fires. I'm not putting my stove behind bulkhead 4. I once had to leave a burning tent a bit sharpish and you don't want a source of flame between you and the only exit. It seems to me that the design position for the stove is the perfect place for the extinguisher.
Life is compromises and I'm not happy about being battery dependent. Light and heat (and cooking) needn't be electically powered and given the reasonable precautions of common sense, good equipment and back up safety gear - fire blanket and extinguisher - I ought to be ok. If I should burn the boat I'll only need to swim to shore and then I'll get a train home. 

Cheers,
