Subject: Car topping?

Hey guys and gals,

I did see Matt's boat on the top of his ford. I also have a small car and would not think about adding all that windage to a long highway trip. I would rather pick up a used or brand new trailer from Harbor Freight Tools (under $200) or from another such discount place, rent an open Uhall trailer for a few days down to my destination and rent another trailer for the few days on the way home. 

One benefit would be the ability to use your boat as a place to sleep in if you have a long trip and drive a small car like Matt, I would like to see a Paradox or Enigma in a Walmart parking lot for an over night stay if needed.
