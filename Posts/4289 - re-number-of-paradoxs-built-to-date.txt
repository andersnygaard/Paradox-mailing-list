Subject: Re: Number of Paradox's built to date

You've got a point about the ease of handling with a junk sail.  I've 
owned 3 junk rigged vessels and I believe there is no better cruising 
rig, except perhaps the standing lugsail of Paradox.  I agree with 
you that co-ordinating the halyard with the furling line will take a 
bit of practice, but I've seen Al, here in the UK with his 'Little 
Jim' and he makes it look as easy as Matt Layden the designer 
himself.  I've had a couple of sails on Al's boat and I made a bit of 
a hash of it at the Beale Park Boat Show, when I just could not make 
the sail furl correctly, but I'm convinced I'll get the hang of it.  
I intend to do my first sail with 'Faith' on some open water which 
will give me time for rectifying mistakes.

As I build 'Faith' I'm more and convinced Paradox is a fine little 
cruiser primarily for one person, although a child and an adult could 
quite happily sail with some comfort.  That's the point - Paradox, 
although small looks like a 'comfortable' boat.  Take a few different 
cushions for various seating options because she's a boat that will 
look after herself, with very little attention on open water.  No 
acrobatics are required; launching and recovery from the water needs 
techniques for specific trailers.  Have you see the photos of Al's 
trailer?  The wheel hubs never get wet, except when it's raining.
