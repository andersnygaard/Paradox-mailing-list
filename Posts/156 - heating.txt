Believe it or not, Matt's tried just about everything in his boats. One winter he actually froze into a salt water pond in Cape Cod just to see how it would be like. I guess he had read too many polar exploration books. Anyway, he said that just his body heat and the sun coming in through the windows kept the boat comfortable (for him). I've found, however, that when I work in the boat in the winter time (which is stored outside), I just turn on the stove and leave it on the very very lowest setting. It's amazing how hot it gets in there. May sure you leave a crack open in the hatch, though, because you need ventilation and you can be driven out by the HEAT.
