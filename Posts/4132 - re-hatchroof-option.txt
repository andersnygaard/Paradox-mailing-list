Subject: Re: Hatch/Roof Option

I see no reason why this shouldn't work in principle. I myself seriously considered fitting a canvas top instead of the hatch and ply roof. The problem is that this would considerably reduce the survivability in a knock down, though it would still be much better than most other boats of similar size.

The bottom line is where are you going to use it. If you are mostly sailing in sheltered waters then it may be reasonable modification

Maybe a combination of a hard top for serious cruising, to be replaced with a soft top for more social outings would be the best compromise.
