Subject: Re: How do I rig my sail for windward ability

Geoff,

Sail her as if she's been rigged with a junk sail, i.e., keep the boom over the leeward quarter. Always have the luff tight. Sail her free; never pinch and keep her moving. Pointing too high stalls the sail, and sheeting in too tightly prevents the wind from flowing nicely from the leech. The luff should almost be ashake.

Paradox will not go to windward well in anything above force 5.

Do you have battens in your sail? The photo would suggest you do. I am not sure battens will help - just don't know, because I have not tried a sail with battens on Paradox.

Chine runners can make a difference to windward performance. If they are not built to plan the performance will suffer. Fifteen degrees of heel makes for better progress on the wind.

Al is a master of sailing his 'Little Jim'to windward. I have sailed alongside him in 'Faith'. Sometimes his sail looked as if it were set for reaching, rather than beating, and yet the boat was going well.

I gave up on windward progress in winds over force 5 and equipped 'Faith' with a Honda 2.3. That solved the problem - I reduced sail and used the engine! Sometimes, I even took the sail down, and just used the engine. Paradox is a brilliant motorboat.

Bill.
