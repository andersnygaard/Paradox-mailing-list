Ive looked into the hardening problem,  not knowing what exatcly is the makeup of the bronze, ie tin content copper and phosphorus, we cannot say exactly.  if you can find out from where you got the bronze, we can then find out its properties. 

I would suggest to ask the expert on this, check this link out  http://www.anvilfire.com  he will answer questions!!! very cool site!

You may want to build 2 scale models and hit a small stream and test it out, one with the radius and one without, that could shed some light on this.

It may be that the radius is so when beached we dont void the edge and expose bare wood, we know what happens then, and all you will get in the end will be a curved edge anyway, and since you have bronze, epoxy and divinycell, there is no wood to rot out. paint is cheap and well, its a paradox, not a ocean liner, easy to outhaul and inspect, repair. 

personally I feel that bronze is an excellent choice for the bottom in your application.

have you already attached it to the boat?
