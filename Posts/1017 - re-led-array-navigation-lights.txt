Thanks for the 4 copies of this email from cross-posting. If you're going to post the same thing in multiple forums, please don't cross post it back to the other forum(s) where you also posted it.

Try typing in "LED navigation lights" in Yahoo.

FWIW, the last time I looked, about a year ago, they where hellishly expensive from commercial sources. I'm going to stick to keroscene lamps - they're legal and cheap to operate. Not only that, but having nav lights on does not reduce to any significant degree your need to keep a lookout - the big guys are not much more likely to notice you whatever brightness your lights are as low to the water as you are - if they are even keeping a watch at all.

If you really have to have LED lights, it would be cheaper to buy incandescent fixtures and adapt LED lamps to them yourself since the LED lit fixtures are that much more expensive than the same incandescents.

http://ledmuseum.home.att.net/index.htm will give you links to places that sell all sorts of LEDs and LED based illumination.

BTW, don't forget that you'll need an anchor light too. I rate that as more important than nav lights.
