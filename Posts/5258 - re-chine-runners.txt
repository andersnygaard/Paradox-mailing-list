I took Little Jim out last weekend. I launched at Appledore, on the north coast of Devon, on the Friday evening and sailed to Clovelly on Saturday, and back on Sunday.

While at anchor off Appledore, on Friday night, I remembered I had put a spring balance on board and, as there was about 1 knot of current flowing I took some measurements on the anchor line.

The tide was about 1 knot and the wind (blowing in the same direction) was about F3.

With the boat head to tide the load on the anchor line was 1.5kg.
Broadside on with the hull level the load was 5kg.

While still broadside on I then heeled the hull to about 10 degrees by leaning out.

Heeled into the tide the load was 8.5kg.
Heeled away from the tide the load was 5kg.

This, of course, does not duplicate the conditions while sailing and I was unable to heel far enough to lift the chine runners out of the water, but it may give some ammunition for the various arguments. I will leave the balance on board so if I get suitable conditions I may be able to make some other measurements.

The trip to Clovelly is about 10 miles, in 2 legs - Out of the estuary (about 2.25 miles) and then across the bay. Getting out of the estuary beating against both wind and tide we covered a total distance of 6.75 miles and then were close hauled to Clovelly. Journey time 6 hours.
The return journey was broad reaching on both legs. Journey time 2.75 hours.

Hoping for calm nights
