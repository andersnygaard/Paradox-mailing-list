Great Mills (now Focus) Buckingham green. I was building a dinghy a few years ago and they were selling it off cheep because it still had the GM logo on it. There was half a tin left when I built Little Jim, so I couldn't let it go to waste.

The picture is on Chichester Harbour in a F5 (I think).

Hoping for calm nights
