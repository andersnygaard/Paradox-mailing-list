I would leave it till you can hoist the sail. I tie the halyard round 
the spar through a hoop screwed on the underside. It would be easy to 
move the hoop if required.

I don't think my sail has a gap in it! I'd best check that out but if it hasn't it ought to be 
easy to cut my own? Don't want to cut in the wrong place though.

Looking at sail in the JPG version of page 1, it looks to be
664.35mm from the front, 1935.65mm from the back.  Double check
that though!
