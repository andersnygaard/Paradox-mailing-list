When I had had a bit of experience with Little Jim I lined the 
forward half of the sole with a cut-up foam sleeping mat. This, with 
a gardening kneeling mat for the rear, made moving about much more 
comfortable. The problem was that the sleeping pad wasn't tough 
enough and got damaged fairly quickly. Last year I lined the whole of 
the sole with matting intended for putting in front of a work bench 
(from Halfords). This is tough enough that it doesn't show damage 
after being scuffed about with shoes on. And not having to move the 
kneeling pad about makes things easier too.
