Subject: Re: Questions regarding Paradox plans - recap

- How many yards of 38" wide woven roving (using three layers on bottom) and 50" 6.0 oz fiberglass cloth (using one layer everywhere else) to order?  I estimated 28 yards and 20 yards respectively, with plenty of extra scrap.  Enough?  *Way* too much?

I'm thinking about 18 yards of 38" roving and about 18 yes of Cloth. As I recall I used 60" wide 7.9 oz cloth because it was cheaper for some reason.

- How are the shelves mounted to the bin sides?  Just epoxy?  A cleat (not shown in drawing)?  Just using screws or nails would be attaching to the end grain of the plywood shelf where it would not hold well.

They are put on with an epoxy fillet top and bottom to the aft side of the bin face. Haven't had any problems in 4 years.

- I don't at all understand how the "metal angle" shown on page 5 is to be used, or attached.  Can someone please go into further detail of this?  What length angle to get, and is that 1"x1" angle iron?

I bought a piece of aluminum angle from the local hardware store 1" X 1". It is attached to the underside of the water tank top to capture the bottom of the bin face which doesn't extend to the floor like the aft ones because your ballast is mounted to the floor in that area and you want it outboard as much as possible.
