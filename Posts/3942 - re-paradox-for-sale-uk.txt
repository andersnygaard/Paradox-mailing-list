Hi Neils

I believe that you Americans use a different blood sugar measuring system to us so the 'perfect' range here is 4 to 7 with a rise to 11 straight after eating.
I normally hypo at 4.3 but get some warning in the way of shaking hands, headache and confused feeling, and I've never hypoed of a night before. On the two nights in question I fell into mid 3's without warning, unless waking up was the warning, and just had enough of my wits about me to get sugar and carbohydrate into myself. Besides the consequent feeling lousy it occured to me that if I had woken so confused that I hadn't taken the sugar then I'd have gone into coma, and there I was anchored just off an empty bit of lovely Dorset coast in a small boat by myself. Dying per se doesn't bother me (I have a great hope of an afterlife with good comedians and free flowing lager) but the thought of the wife smiling for the first time in nearly 40 years appals me :0)
The hospital suggests lowering my insulin before activity but as you know that is pretty hit and miss. If the activity then turns out not to be sufficient you've got another problem in being too high and the subsequent damage to eyes, heart, liver and kidneys.
All in all, the sedentary life style is more appropriate for me.

The wife, bless her, has bought me a tired old motor cruiser to restore. It is 4.98 metres long and 0.6 mtres draft so still falls into my definition of microcruiser. Mr. Honda can do the work and I'll do the exploring. I'll get a lot of pleasure from the rebuild as well!

Thanks for your comments; I appreciate them.

Derek
