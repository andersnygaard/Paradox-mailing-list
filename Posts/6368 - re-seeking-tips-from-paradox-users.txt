Al, 

"It might work, but you would be making an entirely different beast to the Paradox yuloh. If the Paradox used a slalom stroke it might be considered an evolutionary change. As designed it uses a falling leaf stroke so the blade has to behave more like a wing. Flexible wings are not, generally, a good thing"

EXCEPT ALL FISH  What do they know that we don't?

I only know of one type of fish that uses wings, and they are quite stiff.

The motion of a fish is entirely different to the motion of a yuloh. It is possible to imagine that the motion of a slalom-type sculling oar could be developed into that of a fish. Such devices, with flexible fish tails have been built, though I don't know of any that are in common usage.

The Paradox yuloh uses a falling leaf stroke which is entirely different. It produces thrust in the same way as an aircraft wing. I cannot see how it could work if it were flexible.

I would be happy to be proved wrong, though.

Hoping for calm nights
