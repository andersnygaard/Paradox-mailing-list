All congratulations greatfully accepted guys. A new launching does enliven the site and provide encouragement for those thinking about building or in the process. It was only after seeing Al's photos of Little Jim's launching early this year that pure envy drove me to commit to the project. I should say that I will be keeping to relatively protected and shallow waters in my holiday until the rig has been thoroughly tested. I live in Brisbane Queensland and my sailing area is Moreton Bay which extends from the Gold Coast in the South to Caloundra on the Sunshine coast in the North (probably 200km) and is protected from the Pacific Ocean by 4 large sand islands. The centre section is relatively open water while the North and South ends have narrow channels and many mangrove Islands. Bottoms are almost exclusively sand and mud with plenty of drying banks to spend the night on. Senorita has volunteered to catch, clean and cook the fish - she has many practical skills having grown up on a farm in Fiji.

By for now
