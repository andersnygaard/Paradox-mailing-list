At the last weighing the boat was 526kg on the trailer, loaded with stores. I got a trailer specially built that doesn't require the wheels to go in the water, however that means it is a sturdy trailer weighing in at just over 400kg. So well over 900kg all up weight.

If you manage to keep the all up weight below 750kg you may be legal without brakes, but will have problems if you need to manhandle it on anything of a slope. I would have fitted brakes even if it was below the weight limit as my drive is on a slope.

Hoping for calm nights
