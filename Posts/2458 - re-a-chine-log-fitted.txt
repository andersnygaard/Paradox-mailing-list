Subject: Re: A chine log fitted

The second chine log is fitted. 
No picture; suggest looking at other one and using the imagination :0

Getting close to fitting the bottom now and am trying to avoid scarf jointing the sheets of 
18mm ply. I came across a drawing by Nels on another site of a lap butt joint. It looks easy 
to construct (I'd use a router), has loads of gluing area and I could drive ring nails into or 
through it. Bearing in mind that I am using a doubled cross weave cloth on the bottom and 
not crossing the gulf stream are there any comments on the joints suitability, please.
BTW, I am not fitting water tanks but will use stores and lead to compensate.

thanks a lot.......Derek
