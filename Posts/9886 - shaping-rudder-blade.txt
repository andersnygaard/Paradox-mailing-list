Subject: Shaping Rudder Blade 

Hi All,

I'm currently building a Paradox in Thailand and I am loving Don's guide! However, I am totally baffled by the section on shaping the rudder blade. If someone could please help me with the following questions it would be greatly appreciated:

- What size should the radius diameter for the leading edge be?
- I think I understand that the line curves to the maximum thickness which is approximately one third of the way back from the leading edge, but I still need to know the leading edge radius size to start with.
- What is the width of the small flat at the trailing edge when the curve of the blade curves downward?
- On Don's sketch, it says "Mark this distance on the rudder blade for the first peak," what is that distance? Also, I see two other peaks marked in the illustration, how do you come up with those peaks and what are the measurements?

It makes sense to me to make a series of flats to make the blade, but I am having trouble marking those flats and peaks on the template or blade. How do I pick up the peaks and draw lines with a sharpie pen onto the blade surface?

Lastly, is the shape of the rudder essentially done by eye?

Thank you in advance for any help you can give!

Tony
