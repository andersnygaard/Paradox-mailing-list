Subject: Re: Sail Insignia....

Nebwest, I agree with you. However as someone who spent his entire life in the technical field, I know how hard it is to change hats (and mindset) and deal with the human/art side. Indeed, the thought may never have crossed his mind. As I see it, all we can legitimately do is provide some girst for the mill. In all likelihood, Matt's obviously fertile mind will come up with something completely different -- assuming that he considers the subject worth consideration.

Edward, the more I read about the black swan, the better I like the concept. It's just arcane enough to suit my sense of humor.

Along the same lines, how about the bumble bee? It's a critter that common sense says shouldn't fly, but does so very well. I uploaded a royalty-free clip art that I found as an example.
