Alastair,
Are you using a folding bike? How do you stow it?

It is a Brompton. By taking the opening through bulkhead 2 down to the cabin sole the bike just fits through into the "forward stateroom".

It has made me more adventurous with the weather when coasting as, if I find I can't sail back for some reason, I know I can cycle/bus/train back to collect the car and trailer.

Sail when you can, row when you must, motor when you have to be at work in the morning.
