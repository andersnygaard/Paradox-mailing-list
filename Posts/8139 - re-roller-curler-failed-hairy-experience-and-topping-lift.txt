Just to say, if you build the furling gear to plan, keep an eye on the tack rope where it goes through the deck. I spotted mine when it was chafed half through. Lots of working and flexing as the boom moves.

I now have a short length of plastic pipe sleeved over the rope where it goes through the deck.
