Hello Fellow Paradoxians;

I am interested in ideas from others on protecting the leading edge of the rudder. Too often it becomes the default depth finder.

Please share any ideas you have or taken to mitigate against damage to the leading edge of the rudder usually caused by hitting rocks or other hidden objects.

Thank you,
Deric

Thank you to everyone for sharing your ideas to protect the leading edge of the rudder. A few suggestions were:

1) Teflon rub rail
2) Pipe - copper or galvanized
3) Epoxy with tape or rope

I have the winter to make the improvement to the rudder.

Best,
Deric
