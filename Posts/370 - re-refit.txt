I would soak the bare wood with anti-freeze before I closed it back up.

Hi All,
 
I just got through sanding the paint off the bottom, it looks good 
except a place around blk # 3, the ply looked dark so I ground the 
glass off, the ply feels damp, no rot just damp. My plan is to grind 
the glass off all around it and let it dry, then lay the roving.
 
What do you Guys think ?
