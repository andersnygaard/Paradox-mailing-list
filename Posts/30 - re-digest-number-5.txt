I can't answer all your questions, but for those I can see below.

1)I don't seem to find a place where one can get the plans from. Could anybody help? and what is the price?

Dave Bolduc

Greensboro
NC 27405
tel 336-272-1801 (after 9:00pm EST)

$35 US

2)What is the trailered weight of it? that is without any food stores and such? would it be a good boat for day sailing? Here in the south of New Zealand the weather is not always great and the enclosed sailing does appeal to me. Then too the simple rig as two of my trips to our beautiful lakes has been marred by fansy equipement breaking in the strong winds and rought conditions we sometimes experience.

3)What is it like in a 2-4ft fresh water chop? My guess is that it will just plough through it as it is so heavy.

4.) I have Don's first building article, which I downloaded of the Web from somewhere. Where can I find the 2nd article?

From Don himself, he is on this list or at delliott@tomah.com

5.) Sorry last question for now. ;-) How many sheets of plywood and what thicknesses of plywood is involved?

1 @ 6mm
3 @ 9mm
4 @ 12mm
2 @ 18mm

and quite a lot of real wood too.

Hoping for calm nights
