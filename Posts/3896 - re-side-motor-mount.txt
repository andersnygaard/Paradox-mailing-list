I am interested in how this works for you.  My best idea is to build an outboard bracket box on the transom with an open top.  The box should be big enough to hold a 2 gallon jug of gas, and the outboard would be clamped to the aft edge of the box.  Somehow the controls need to be lead forward, a shutoff switch lead to the cockpit and the pull start cord extended forward.
