Tom if a JR (JunkRig) works on a Paradox I'm onboard. I'm a proponent of the JR (JunkRig) approach because it's stress free, which incl's being a heap cheaper. Just a jib for a 14' dinghy here is $600 Aud. JR's 2000yrs active service as a device says something surely. The lugsail issues may be Paradox's squeeky wheel.
