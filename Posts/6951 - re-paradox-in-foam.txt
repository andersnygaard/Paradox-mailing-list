Subject: Re: paradox in foam

Welcome Greg.

Yes there has been a Paradox built in foam.
Look for Paraplastic in the photo sections here and also in the overflow group http://groups.yahoo.com/group/paradoxbuilders2/photos/album/804005672/pic/list.

If you search through the messages with paraplastic as the filter you should find some more info.
I can't help on construction - mine's plywood as per the plans!
