Ole, 

I believe that the empty weight of my Paradox with ballast is on the order of 650 lbs and may be as high as 750. With stores for a month and water tanks full, I would guess about 900 lbs. One day I am going to get around to scaling her because this is a question which often comes up, perhaps within the next few days or so, and I can give you a better answer. Her designed displacement is 1400 lbs.

Tailwinds, 
Glen
