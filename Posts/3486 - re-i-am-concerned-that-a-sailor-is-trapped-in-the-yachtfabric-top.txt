I have adopted a similar principle to this. I have an umbrella which I clamp on to the back of the sliding hatch. This is most useful for keeping off the sun or rain while at anchor, while still allowing the outdoors experience. 

to cater for all conditions. It is also useful when going ashore to the pub in the rain.

I like the hard hatch from a security point of view. With it locked shut I have no qualms about leaving the boat unattended.

A Panama if the sun is shining, a bobble-less bobble hat if it is cold. A Deer Stalker would be good, with those ear flaps.

I noticed on Saturday how secure you boat is with padlock through the hatch slider. Would be reassuring if leaving the boat unattended by the towpath.

If you had a soft top Derek, don't you think you are more vunerable to vandals?
