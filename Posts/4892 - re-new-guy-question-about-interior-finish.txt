The failure was entirely my own fault. I used an expensive primer specifically designed to stick to epoxy (that has worked well elsewhere) but applied it in the middle of winter. Only later did I read on the tin that it should not be applied below 6 deg C  :-(

I wouldn't bother painting the inside if I were to build again YMMV.

What are the UV filtering properties of Lexan?
