Subject: Re: Storing gas

Thank you both, Al and Bill. This is an very important insight. The heeling will clearly make this idea unworkable. The transome mounting makes good sense. But tell me Bill can you reach the throttle from inside the cabin? And for refilling the tank? I mean do you need to go out onto the deck to manage the engine?

Best regards,
