Subject: Re: Mini Paradox idea

I dont know if a smaller Paradox a good idea or not. I have not sailed my own yet. However you remind me of an earlier idea I had along this line. That is to build a Bolger Brick but put the Paradox deck and cabin and chine runners and Paradox sail rig on it, scaled down. Just a thought.

Hello to all on the list. I have bought the paradox plans and have spent much time with pencil, paper and calculator going over things. I am currently prepping my work area and thinking about the project. However, here is the rub. I really want to go sailing now, and I can't find anywhere in my area that will rent me a sailboat for the lake I live near.
