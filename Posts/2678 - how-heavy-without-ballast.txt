Subject: How heavy without ballast?

Hello,

I've been considering the Paradox for months, the main limitation for me is building space, I have the room but access is a little awkward.

Can anyone tell me roughly how heavy Paradox is during building?

If I go ahead I would like to get as much done at home as possible, before moving the boat to another location to fit her out.

In order to move her she would have to be manhandled over one or two obstructions and I would really like to know how heavy the basic hull is.
