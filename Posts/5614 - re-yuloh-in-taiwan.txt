I wonder if the line is just there to make sure if the yuloh comes off the ball and you drop it you don't lose it.

Can't wait to hear from Jimmy. Also remember to take pics or a vid of your first launch!
I hope you have a wonderful adventure up there. It is the ideal playground for this boat.

Mr. Jimmy Lu

Your boat looks very well made and finished too. And I wish you long enjoyment with it. 

I have a question about the Yuloh. I'm going to assume that the yuloh is in wide use there in Taiwan. If this is true could you please tell us somthing of it's use? Also, concerning the details of the yuloh in the drawings, is Matts design in agreement with common yulohs there? Somtimes I have found pictures and diagrams where the handle has a small rope running down to the deck. Is that always used? And what is it's name?

There is extremely little to no use of the yuloh here where I live, near Seattle.

Good Luck
Steve Yahn
