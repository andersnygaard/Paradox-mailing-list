I hope you understand that I am not trying to discourage what you are
doing but simply providing information about factors you may not be
fully aware of. And I encourage any efforts to keep weight down. The
heavy bottom on Paradox is not where I would want to cut corners if I
were building one.

There are probably about 20 or more designs that I know of with the
same basic philosophy in mind, shallow draft, flat bottoms, higher
topsides to provide added flotation and shelter to the occupants. All
have heavier than "normal" bottoms since that is where a good deal of
their self-righting ability comes from. 

Many have been "field tested" to see how self-righting they actually
are and every tester has been surprised how well they do their job.

There is one example here:
