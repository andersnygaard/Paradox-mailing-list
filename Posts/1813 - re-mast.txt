Something else to consider is that if the aluminium mast proved to 
be unsatisfactory the difficulty of converting the (now finished) boat 
to take a different mast would probably be more than the effort of 
making a wooden one in the first place.

I was agreeably surprised to find how easy the wooden mast was 
to build!

How many spares will you have? As the song goes, "On the blue highway,
we travel alone".

Sell the aluminium mast from the light displacement dinghy, and
purchase the materials to easily build the mast for the heavy
displacement Paradox. Alternatively, you may purchase a text on yacht
design which will provide the necessary formula(s) to determine a
comparable aluminium mast diameter, and wall thickness to approximate
the designed spar. Last thing you want to do is watch a wet noodle go
out of column, and subsequently buckle to the deck. The notion that
aluminum and wood masts of comparable diameter possess similar
strength is patently absurd. This particularly in light of the fact
that this spar is unstayed, and does not include a yard parrel. Look
over some of the Paradox photos which show a heavy reef. 

I'm not suggesting that an aluminium mast couldn't be used, just that
the builder should run the numbers to determine exactly what diameter
and wall thickness would compare to the designed stick. Why trust luck
in the equation?
