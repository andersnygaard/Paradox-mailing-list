Thank you Al. I remembered reading about the nice rudder control 
comments by you and the others. It was still so new to see it for 
myself. I have used some of your recomendations too. My wife likes 
the boat so far. She was surprised at how tiny the boat seems on the 
outside and how roomy it seems inside. Sleeping in the boat will come 
later. Snoring (mine)is more likly to make trouble than lack of 
space. The cabintop eyes would be free of conflict with the 
sail/yuloh. I want to thank you for helping me during the build. This 
group is a wonderful aid to the fun of the boat. Best regards to all.
