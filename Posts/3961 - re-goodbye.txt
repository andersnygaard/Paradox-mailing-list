Derek,

You cant leave.........were all pals here.....But if you must please stay in touch.

God Bless

David Beard


  Thanks to everybody for their help during the build. I'd like to particularly single out Al Law, 
  Dave Bolduc, David Beard and Don Elliot.

  If my op works (booked in for next March) I may build again. but a lighter, quicker and dirtier 
  build perhaps incorporating some of Jeff Uk's changes and definitely making proper Honda 
  provision :0)

  Cheers all ..... Derek
