Lately, I've noticed a couple of our members have done quite long cruises requiring them to be offshore for several days at a time. I think we've probably all read of Dave's adventure through the Hawaiian Islands. His blog detailing that trip is here:

Graduating to a smaller boat https://daveskaife.wordpress.com/

Then I stumbled across this blog entry ( Cruising Ashiki: Shark Bay: Shelter Bay Paradox http://cruisingashiki.blogspot.co.nz/2014/05/shark-bay-shelter-bay-paradox.html) where Geoff had sailed his Paradox from Perth up to Shark Bay, WA a distance of 800 kms according to Wikipedia. The blogger says it took him 5 days which works out at 160km (100 miles) per day. Maybe the distances involved are a bit less than what I've stated here (but then, the blogger said Geoff's Paradox is 14' 6" rather than 13' 10" which can't be right), but even so this is big stuff.

I've looked but I can't find any record of Geoff's trip on the Internet. Are you there Geoff? I would love to hear more about your trip.

Cheers,
Rob.
