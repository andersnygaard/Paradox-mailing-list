Mr. Clark, sorry to hear your sugars have been going low. Being a diabetic myself I know how frustrating it can be. Now my glucose numbers are not the greatest and argue with the Dr.s that they are are trying to keep my numbers too low for the active life style I have (when I'm not sitting behind the desk all week). The safety margin at 100 is just not that great. So I try to keep myself at 150 for the extra safety margin while sailing and doing other activities. Anyway I hate to see you give up something you love so much. Look at the good side, all this activity allows us to eat more!
I would love to buy your boat, but shipping to Jacksonville, FL may be too much.
Also want to thank you for the Duckworks article too.
Regards,
Niels

Hey Niels.
You could always buy it and keep it over here and commute weekends ;-).
Hi Derek. Sorry to hear about your diabetic condition. After all that work, there is nothing to show for it but a great little boat built by your hands that will give pleasure to someone else.
Have you had a word with your doctor, like Niels said, about bumping up your levels for when you want to go sailing?
I was looking forward to meeting both Al, yourself and a brace of PARADOXI out on the water some time.
You still have the plans, why not make a radio-controlled model of ENUF?
