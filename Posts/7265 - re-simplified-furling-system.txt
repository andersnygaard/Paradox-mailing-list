A lot of pages on Nautical Thing are mines (eric17, with the Tom Thumb avatar) : most of the stuff about "Petits bateaux Rigolos" (=3D funny wee boats), for instance, except when Yann helped me.
Worst of it, our webmaster is not "available" for several months, and as "first contributor" of the website, I advise and assist other users, as a self-proclaimed=C2=A0"janitor".
But it's a very "time consuming" activity, so, ahem, a lot of my pages are not finished.....

And it's more fun to play with Yann, sending him critics and suggestions (through personal emails) about his new project Skrowl, and designing my own "sister project" Skrome, with all the suggestions he rejected=C2=A0 

I'll finish all that when I'll be retired ....
I tried to put an English translation in one of my pages (little trimaran "Petit Poucet 17"), but it's too difficult for me. So I just modified my words to get a better Google translation. With a very moderate success (i.e. complete butchery), this robot thing is really stupid...

So no problem with these pages, Paul, I'm just ashamed I didn't finish them all.....
Eric

Oh, sorry are those yours? I can't read French, so I don't know what I'm looking at! Look's like some really useful info there.
