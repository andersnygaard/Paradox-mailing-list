Subject: Re: Sail Insignia....

Hey Phil,

Yes, I would really love it if we got a sail insignia as the "official" insignia. My suggestion would be the "Ying/Yang  emblem that is seen on some of the photos of Dave and Mindy's " boat (I beleive it was "Little Cruiser") Seems to me the Ying/Yang is the perfect symbol for the Paradox and the emblem is very pleasing to the eye. 

Dave!  Are you out there?  Any input?    

Also....when the plans are sold...are they numbered?  If so then a hull number could be incorporated into the sail also with each boat having a unique and identifiable number???
