Subject: Re: I am concerned that a sailor is trapped in the yacht.

I was in a tandem microflight on my 3rd hour of lessons and supposedly had control. I'd previously done some gliding and had managed ok up to then so I think the instructor had more faith in me than I had. I was in a thermal and suddenly I wasn't and the thing dropped like a brick while I panicked and pushed and pulled everything. Of course, as soon as I let go it just recovered. Entirely my own fault, and very frightening. I can still remember the stomach in the roof feeling; a bit like parachuting with the certainty that the chute wasn't going to open.
Do you know Keith Negal? He's led the British team a couple of times.
