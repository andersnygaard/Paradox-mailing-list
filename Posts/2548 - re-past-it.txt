I would imagine that you are the perfect age for a PARADOX since this is a very easily handled microcruiser. The boat has an easy motion at sea, the sail is small, the anchors are light, you sail from within the security of the cabin, the mast is easy to step alone, and this sharpie draws a mere 9 inches. I believe that when you get older you should move down in boat size rather than up. Bigger boats that supposedly give you more comfort actually take a lot more energy to handle and to maintain. In addition, there are tons of complex systems (electrical and mechanical) to go wrong, and everything is bigger, heavier and more expensive to operate. When I'm your age (I'm 42 now), I don't want to be cranking on winches and wrestling heavy ground tackle just so that I can go sailing. Come to think about it, I don't think I want to do it now. I guess that's why my wife and I sail a 15 foot boat (Little Cruiser) and why we just got an even smaller boat (Swamp Thing) for when one of us wants to sail alone.

Incidentally, our friend Dave Gatan, who gave us the recently acquired 13' microcruiser, day sailed this tiny craft for many years in the Florida Keys when he was in his 60's. Now that he has turned 70, he has decided to become a full time liveaboard, and he has continued with the "go small" philosophy by moving aboard a compact 23' double ender called a Rob Roy Canoe Yawl. So far he has been happy with his new boat and home, Panacea; though he did admit to me the other day that he misses the simplicity and ease of sailing his old microcruiser.
