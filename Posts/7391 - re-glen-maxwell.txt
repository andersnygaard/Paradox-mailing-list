Hello David,

I'm afraid life has gotten in the way of my trip and I have had to postpone it. I am hoping to getaway now in Oct. of this year if I can. I fell into a real depression at the loss of Zoe and have pretty much just been a lurker since. Thanks for your concern as to my whereabouts. I plan to be at the Cedar Key mess-about this year. Would be great to see you and the others if you are going to be there.

Best Regards
Glen
