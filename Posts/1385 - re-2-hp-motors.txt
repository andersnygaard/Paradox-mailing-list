I agree that there is too much rocker in the stern section for it to lift over it's own bow wave. In order to plane it would need a flatter run aft. But then it would drag its own tail when sailing heeled. Hard to get both in a sharpie from what I have heard.

Bolger has designed at least a couple of sharpies that will plane and sail well too, but it is always a trade-off.
