Ok, now you've started here's a little hint about the process. Sometimes projects stall and nothing gets done. The remedy to this human habit is to do at least one thing physically to your project each day, no matter what. No matter how quick or seemingly insignificant, do one thing every day. The effect on motivation is fantastic and drives things forward.

Nick, those beams are beautiful. I like the 2 tone and will now build mine like that.

Today, I picked up a beautiful piece of Mahogany, 1" x 10" x 9". The color is consistent, and the grain is about as straight as possible, and I paid for it $$$.

I also picked up 2 boards of the same size in White Oak. One for beam laminates and one for bulkhead cleats. And a 1- 9mm Lloyd's Certified Okoume Ply, more $$$$. If the Oak doesn't work (bend), I'll use the Okoume with Mahogany to laminate beams.

Side note! In Devon's Plywood boat building book, it mentions White Oak as good wood for boat building, but in Paradox plans, Matt says to avoid Oak. Maybe he's referring to Red Oak, which is oily (not good for gluing)?

Out of the blue, an old friend called today who happens to be passionate about woodworking with a well-equipped shop. Sunday, I will make my first official cuts when the beam laminates are ripped with his table saw! It's only taken me nine years to get to this point!!!!
