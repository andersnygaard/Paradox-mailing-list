Subject: Re: Rudder construction...

Hi,

Like other aspects of Paradox, the rudder is a bit different from the 'norm'. Most lifting rudder-blades are sandwiched between TWO cheek pieces (on the stock) which take any side-thrusts. Anyone got any comments about this? I haven't seen any (comments)on the group so I presume it must be plenty strong enough as is...Does the washer/nut not tend to eat away at the wood/fiberglass with use?

Thanks,
Alan.

What are people's thoughts on putting bushes in both the stock and the rudder through which the bolt holding them together can pass?

The plans simply show holes in both the stock and the rudder, but how does one stop the ingress of water here, especially as this part is below the waterline?

Bill.
