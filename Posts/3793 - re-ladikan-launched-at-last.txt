Subject: Re: Ladikan launched at last

Congratulations Bengt.

I'm intrigued by the two part cabin. Any chance of some more pictures showing that?

I'm on target to launch Monday. I've decided not to take the wheelie bin as a tender in cause the council moan. The trailer will be green enough with a bit of weed wrapped around it, Alan :0)
