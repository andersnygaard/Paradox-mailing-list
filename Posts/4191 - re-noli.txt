Hi George.

NOLI has only a 7" draught.
The hull is made from 1/4" and 3/8" Gaboon marine ply with three layers of glass on the bottom just back past the halfway mark, then two to the transom and only one layer on the sides and deck.
The bulkheads are all only 3/8" Gaboon marine ply. The deck is 1/4" Gaboon marine ply.
I have made an allowance for crew and stores of about 350lbs( I weigh 196lbs so I will be looking for a hull weight of 558lbs with ballast to bring her down to her marks. Which is doable.
If you look at my sail plan drawing you will see the rocker is quite fair compared to PARADOX, but I think that PARADOX will be the better sea boat.
For the type of sailing I will hope to be doing, which is coastal in the Solent, half an hour should be enough to get to some form of shelter. When I go out of the Solent and beyond, I hope to have a good forecast.
I won't be turning out any plans for NOLI as I don't want to step on Matt's toe's, but if my design is successful then I might give enough information that along with Matt's PARADOX drawings, which will have to be bought, my articles and a couple of expanded panel drawings and a free CAD program, almost anyone should be able to build a copy that has built a sailing dinghy before.
But we will see.
