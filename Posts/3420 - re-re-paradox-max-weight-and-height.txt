Thanks Derek, It's shown on one of the diagrams published on the internet as a little compartment with items in it - like it was a little shopping basket.

Sounds like that is artistic licence and getting stuff in and out is impractical. Your idea of using it as emergency floatation is ok , except that if it was used in earnest the boat would float bow up and stern down.
The poor survivor would have to sit on the stem awaiting rescue. Still that's better than  sinking ain't it.
