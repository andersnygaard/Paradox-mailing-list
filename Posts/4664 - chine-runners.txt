Subject: Chine runners

I was sitting gazing out the window at work today, when my thoughts turned to the Chine runners (That's how interesting work is!)

Now it seems that the suggested way to fit these is after the bottom is on. I think it would be easier to them before the bottom is fitted. Without the bottom it will be easy to clamp a roughly shaped piece of fir to the side. The bottom shape is not critical beacause it will be simple to plane it down to fair in with the chine logs.I can also mark and cut out the plan shape and then just easily fill in the extra width to the bottom panel once it's fitted. The more I think about it it seems the only logical way of fitting. Am I missing something critical because if not this is the way I'm going to go!
