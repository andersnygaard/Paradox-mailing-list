Subject: Re: begionning trailer Re: Trailers

When I bought my bearing buddies, a few years ago, they came with lots of adaptor rings that looked as if they would fit almost anything.

When I changed my suspension units I could not find the adaptors so I sawed the end off the bearing caps that came with the new hubs and brazed the buddies into them.

I have the same Harbor Freight trailer and attempted to get bearing buddies (or equivalent) for it. After much searching, one RV dealer figured out that the Chinese company that sells it used car hubs instead of trailer hubs: nothing on the market that he could find fits them.
