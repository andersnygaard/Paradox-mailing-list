Subject: Paradox self righting

Hi folks,

Last weekend was the Beale Park Thames Boat Show. Little Jim was there as part of the Dinghy Cruising Association display. While I had plenty of spare bodies I thought it would be worth pulling LJ over and measuring the righting moment.

I set the boat up in cruising trim with the sail hoist and a body (me) in the helm position. The mast was pulled down until the water was a couple of inches below the hatch. I had provided my helpers with a 25 pound spring balance to measure the load at the mast-head. Unfortunately the reading was "well over 25 pounds" so I still don't have an accurate value.

But there is no doubt that a correctly ballasted Paradox will definitely self right from 90 degrees. 

For a video of the exercise see <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9zFRR3M2M0>

It is also worth noting the amount of rolling before it finally settled down after being released.

Hoping for calm nights
