Subject: Epoxy

I've been using epoxy recently for fillits and for using with glass tape and find using it a pain in the ass.
One thing i wondered is is there any difference between WEST'S system epoxy to epoxy that costs half the price?

Plus has anyone used masonry sealant on a boat here and have any thoughts on it?

Bye.
