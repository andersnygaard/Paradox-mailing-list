Subject: Storage space?
Date: 07 Jun 2016 03:22:45 -0700

Hello,

I've nearly completed the internal fit-out and I'm surprised at how little storage I have. By the time I fitted the cooker (a gimballed Origo 1500 which is quite large), a decent deep cycle battery (also quite hefty), two slightly oversized anchors and the 12v pump and associated plumbing it feels like there's not much left to play with. The only space for larger items is in the forepeak, underneath the transom baffle and beneath the state room floor. The side bins and shelves won't take much gear after I install the insulation and the space underneath the cabin floor is also much smaller than I imagined.

Any thoughts of crossing oceans have definitely been crossed off my list... there's just no way I could get enough food and water in along with all the other essentials that you would need for such an adventure.

I'm still happy with my build, but be warned, after the internal fit-out, a Paradox really is a tiny boat! You've got to be an acrobat to reach into the forepeak and getting to items stored beneath the transom baffle isn't easy either.

I'm thinking of buying a plastic box which I could wedge between the mast vent trunk and the port bin side and then secure it with a stretchy to try to gain some more storage.

Cheers,
Rob.
