Subject: Re: Larger Paradox

I see the post by someone about a 28 foot Paradox and in the files section there is a file about making a larger Paradox.

The regular Paradox is held together by bulkheads, but if it is enlarged, wouldn't one have to add stations depending on the degree of enlargement? Also wouldn't a larger boat like the 28 footer also require greater thickness of plywood and other structural members like a keelson etc? What about the interior layout of a big Paradox, wouldn't it radically change as well?

In doing the 28 foot Paradox how were all these other factors taken into account? If one stuck to the plans and just stretched it, there would be 5 or 6 feet between bulkheads in places and I can just envision the plywood flexing in and out as one sailed it especially in rough water.

I am curious because I really like the Paradox design and would like to make a larger one and would like to know the particulars and the best ways to do that.
