Welcome to the club.

My feeling is that a sharp bow wouldn't make much difference to speed. Difficult to tell as I have never of tested it. I do know that it wouldn't be work for me.

When using the yuloh you have no reverse or brake. I find I tend to use the dock as a brake (I even have some rubber mat bonded to the bow to reduce the shock). A sharp bow would be vulnerable to damage.

Of course you may not have my cavalier attitude, in which case it may be better. If you try it let us know.

The blunt bow may be the result of Matt wanting to keep the length below 14ft (Florida licensing rules) or he may have worked out that it made no difference.
