Putting a window on the bottom of a boat is nothing new.  The 32' crusing sharpie, Hog Fish Lips, had one as did our friends power sharpie, Tropicstar.  Both were rather thick pieces of Lexan.  Eventhough, they got scratched, you could easily see through them.  I guess this has something to do with the water.
