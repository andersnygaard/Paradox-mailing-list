I too was impressed with the ingenuity of the 3 positions, but 
looking back I cannot think of a time when I wanted more ventilation 
and couldn't just open the hatch a little. In the Bahamas things may 
be different. Also Little Cruiser seems to have a smaller hole in the 
transom (for the tiller) than Paradox. When it is raining, in the UK, 
more ventilation is not usually top of my wish list.

Hoping for calm nights
