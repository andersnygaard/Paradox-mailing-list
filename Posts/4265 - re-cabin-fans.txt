Subject: Re: Cabin Fans

I have a portable fan that runs on 4 D batteries that I use for tent camping and at home when the power is out. I see what looks like it's first cousin on the Campmor website. It is called Porta Breeze, Item Number: 65501. Mine is quiet and seems to run forever on a set of batteries.
