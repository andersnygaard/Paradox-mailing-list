Hi Dave,

This is really impressive and worth knowing about. Could you provide 
a few more details of the application?

What weight cloth are you using there? How did you prepare the hatch 
ahead of time? Did you sand it down to bare wood and then apply a 
coat of sealing epoxy first? This is what some builders do, and then 
apply the cloth while the sealer coat is still tacky. However this 
can be tricky, as it is difficult to move the cloth around very much. 
Is is easier when using the 3M do you think?

The seal coat prevents the weave filler coats from be absorbed by the 
wood and starving the wood/cloth interface.

That is the procedure used for building cedar strip canoes because 
the cedar is very absorbant. If done correctly there is supposed to 
be a molecular bond between the wood cells and expoxy that links with 
the cloth and it forms one continuous bond that is totally water and 
weatherproof.

The epoxy also adds an abrasive resistance to the cloth, especially 
if carbon is added to the final application of epoxy. On canoes this 
is only done on the very bottom.

Cheers, Nels
