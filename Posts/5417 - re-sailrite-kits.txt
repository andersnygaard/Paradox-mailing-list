Hi Steve,

I was hoping somebody would respond who knows what they are talking about but you got me instead:-)

I really appreciate your putting in the new  sail information as I haven't figured out how to do that myself. What are you supposed to enter in the boxes labeled I,  J,  P,  E,  I2/ P2 , J2/E2?

I do agree that the tack angle looks a bit out of whack but it also is just a computer algorithm with an asterisk beside it - which means questionable.

If you look at the diagram Matt shows in the file folder here - the tack angle does look higher and the head of the sail further forward than the original, so maybe there is some indication it could try to climb the spool when reefing but I could not locate any reference to that in the posting history. I know somebody has suggested making the spool with larger diameter than shown originally - thus you need a larger curvature in the swivel rod to clear the spool?

Maybe adjusting the boom further forward would overcome this - by allowing the sail to overlap a bit forward as it is furled? Not sure how to do that though. Maybe a longer tail end on the swivel rod as well? (Maybe Al or Bill can hep us here.)

The smaller sail area does not bother me though.  I think the higher AR will make it work as well in most situations. Plus the price is cheaper with the lighter weight cloth!

When fully furled the yard will just fall on top of the boom with some loose cloth under and can be snugged down with a couple nylon/velcro straps or a loop of bungie cord. One could also install a second support tube for it forward as well. Those "hoops" make great hand holds as well if one is in the water.

I imagine that last bit of unfurled sail can be used similar to a "storm trysail" if the yard is raise a bit.
