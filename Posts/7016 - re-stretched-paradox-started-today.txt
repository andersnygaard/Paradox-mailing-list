Hello,

When you have time please tell us how you are doing the stretch. Are you increasing the beam and freeboard as well as sail area. What about the chine runners? Are they a percentage of the waterline length so would you increase them 25% as well. Are the chine runners centered on lwl or are they centered further aft.

I guess the rudder area is some percentage of the submerged area so you could the stretched to that percentage.=C2=A0

I like the idea of having a paradox like boat at whatever length suits a person.

Thanks, John Dean
