Hi folks.

Just got back from a three week cruise on the St-John=92s river in Florida USA.  What fantastic cruising grounds for a Paradox!  It was even worth the 6500 km of trailering from northern Qu=E9bec!

Before I left, I was worrying about having a sore bum on the long days I was planning, because it got sore last summer even after a couple of hours of sailing, despite different cushions I had tried. I know that some of you have had the same complaint.  I found a solution which worked like a charm.

I had a long career as a tripping canoeist before I had my Paradox.  Even on 30 day trips with 10 hours of paddling per day, I never had a sore bum. So before I left I decided to make myself a canoe-type seat for my Paradox.

Made it with leftover oak floor boards glued with epoxy.  The webbing can be between 1 1/2 and 2 inches (I used 2 inches but would have preferred 1 1/2 if I could have found some).  Just hammered 3/4 inch tack nails on the inside (not underneath) to fix the webbing.  Drilled holes and inserted glued wooden gudgeons instead of tenons to fix the frames. Cause I=92m not setup to use biscuits.

Dimensions are important for the lengthwise frames.  With 1 1/2 inch webbing, there are 4 straps and 1 1/2 inch boards.   With 2 inch webbing I used 3 straps and 1 3/4 inch boards instead and left 1/4 inch of slack.  In both cases the external width is 10 inches.

Pull the webbing as tight as you can while nailing it. I kept it long so I could have purchase while pulling and cut it after nailing.  Burned the ends with a lighter to prevent fraying.

Works like a charm, BIG improvement over a straight board! On the St-John=92s there were some days with 12 hours of sailing.  No sore bum at all.

Now if only I can figure out how to download a picture for you.  Will file it under Paradox =ABIota=BB.  My seat is longer than yours will be, it is full width because of the iron middle bulkhead on my boat and the absence of side compartments.  

Wishing you all a comfortable ride.
