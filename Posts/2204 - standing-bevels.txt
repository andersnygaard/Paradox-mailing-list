Subject: Standing Bevels?

Hi All,

I just set out a sheet of plywood to mark out the transom and bulkheads and come across the phrase 'Bottom Bevel Left Standing" on plan dwg 7 & 8. I vaguely remember this coming up in past messages but can't find it in the archives.

I assume that the bevel is to allow for the curve of the bottom (and again for the sides?) but how does it affect the measurements? Taking the transom height of 668mm. Is that the total height or is a bit more added for the dotted line that is drawn below the transon on plan sheet 7? 

Also, what is the extra outer line to the right of the centre line around the transom and bulkheads?

Help please I am sorely confused. While I wait for your excellent replies I'll go and make a deck beam jig.

Cheers.....derek
