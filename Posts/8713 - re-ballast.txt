Sampans! square boats. I can see a family resemblance with our can of spam american version of this . okay there's more poetry to the Paradox than that but... they're both square boats sporting big rudders and a bodacious rocker along the length of each. Matt Layden/Lao Tzu same guy really (I almost mean that). Junkrig has to suit his boats.

I can tell you that the Paradox doesn't have to be heeled over a lot to gain leeway resistance.

When sailing nearly level in light winds it does pretty well for leeway. Something to do with the deep rudder and general hull shape acting as a keel.

But does need some way kept on for tacking ability . If yoou get in irons it can be a sod to get going again.............

Oops! Just thought of something worrying about marrying a
junk rig with a Paradox. The lugsail (being a big powerful
lug of a thing) tilts the Paradox over to that audacious
angle enabling the chine-runners to do their thing. Am I
right so far? The junk rig is as aerodynamically efficient
but unaccompanied by the 'lug of a thing' power
lugsails and other 'western' sails possess. Junksail
are famous for how little stress is exerted upon the rig,
resulting in a lot of money saved not having to pay for wear
ans tear and the expensive cloth and construction required
in lug/bermuda sails. So the junksailed Paradox stands
upright and goes really well sideways, the chine-runners
never being properly employed. It would be good if this
assumption is wrong. But if this is the problem Matt twigged
to it a couple of decades ago.

There is quite complete list of paradoxes been
built, in Paradox registry, and there isn't listed any
currently sailing with junk rig. But there is one currently
being built ;) so there may be a good chance to find that
out soon...
