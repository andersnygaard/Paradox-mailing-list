I think I missed some information about the vane gear... what vane was used or was it a custom design? Are there any plans for the vane available? where can I find out more about it?

You probably will not need a lot of chain - 4 metres of chain with a 30 metre anchor warp should cover most contingencies. Take a minimum of 2 anchors along with their warps and chains.
