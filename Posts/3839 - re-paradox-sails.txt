Another possible option might be to make a tapered boom core from rigid foam and then wrap it in carbon tape set in epoxy. This is the same tape that is used for lightweight casts on broken limbs.

Orible would it be too, but saved from view to the world by the sleeve which also protects the boom from UV damage.

The more I think about Matt's sailplan the more I love it. Keep seeing the image of Matt landing in Enigma during the Florida Challenge. Hell - even I can raise a window blind - most of the time anyway;-)
