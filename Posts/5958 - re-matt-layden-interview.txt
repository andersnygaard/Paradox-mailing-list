This is exactly my question as well. I don't even mind subscribing to the magazine, as long as it can be read online. If it's a "paper only" magazine, then I guess I'll have to do without.

Sounds interesting...

Does anyone know if it can be read on line? As many of us do not get the magazine or have access to it at a library.
