I'm very glad to hear someone mention HAMMERITE.  What a great paint (coating?)!  I've used the stuff for about 15 years and it is bulletproof. It's hard to get in the US.  I only know one place that sells it and then they only sell the spray (www.eastwoodco.com).  If anyone knows any other US sources, especially for the brushable, let me know.
