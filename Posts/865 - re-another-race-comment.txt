Hi All,

After studying some of the mail and commentary related to the race, the only thing that could hurt Matt is either a complete loss of wind or if his sailing gear has a major breakdown.

He is enjoying several advantages that must have many of the competitors and bystanders knashing their teeth. While others are fighting surf, waves and fatigue, he is just having another fun few days of microcruising! Of course the roller-launching design was another stroke of genius.

Most of the potential winning designs are racing kayaks and canoes, with small auxiluary sails added. They are narrow, long, open and not very dry or seaworthy. You have to land and set up camp in order to eat and rest, whereas Matt just continues to sail snug as a bug - and perhaps grabbing a few zee's . He has a huge advantage crossing open bays, where the waves might swamp the competition. As you may have heard, he stopped and rescued an overturned kayaker and towed him into shore.

The rulesmakers are probably flabergasted. The entire basis for the race is to challenge expedition hardened paddlers to the limits of their endurance. Now they are all praying for calm winds:-)

Go Matt Go!
