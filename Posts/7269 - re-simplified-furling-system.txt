Translation and sketches coming soon, Nels ! and yes, the sail is cut completely flat.

Paul,

I think Eric was kidding you? I agree there is some very useful information. I would be very interested in getting the sail rig details. Really like the boat design as well but I already have a hull I think the rig could be adapted to. So much more simple than a junk rig!

I was surprised at the sail area 17M2 for a hull that size! But being so easy to furl it makes sense. Looks like it may be cut fairly flat to roll around the boom so nicely?

And thanks for the clarification Eric. I don't quite understand it all yet but it is beginning to look clearer now.
