Hi Sybe,

I recall only using glass matting, not microfibres, so I can't see the photo. My mix was the consistency of thick porridge. I think the amount of epoxy used would have been much less than 250ml, perhaps 100ml.

Unfortunately, I can't remember what I made my mold out of, so I'm not much help to you there. It's possible I bent a bit of tin into shape using screws into a piece of plywood so that the heat could escape as the epoxy went off.

Best regards,
