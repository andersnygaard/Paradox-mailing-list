That is how I read it, yes.

If I were building again, because of this bevelling problem, I would cut the ply to size and put the cleats on overlapping the edge. When the sides are presented to the bulkheads during the trial assembly the correct angle for the bevels will be obvious. Using the dowel pin idea from my last post the bulkheads can be easily removed and replaced without the whole edifice collapsing. I would work outward from bulkhead 3 as this has no bevel.

Al,

Thanks for responding. 

To further clarify, maybe I looked at the plans wrong. Where this is a
curvature indicated say 5mm, the straight line is just a reference
line and not the straight outside edge of the cleat? In other words
the cleat runs right to the edge of the plywood and is curved as well?
Plus it is beveled? Seems difficult to curve the whole edge of ply and
cleat and bevel it.

Thanks for your help,
Paul

The bottoms are beveled but not the sides?
both are bevelled to fit the panel they are joined to.

Is the plywood curved, but the cleat straight? Is the plywood 
curved
If you mean the 5mm curve in the sides, both ply and cleat will have
this curve

No side curve. Why are the sides not beveled then?
The sides are bevelled

The sides an bottom of all the bulkheads are bevelled to match the
angle of the ply attached to it.

Hoping for calm nights
