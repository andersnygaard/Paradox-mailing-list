Subject: Re: newbie...just ordered plans

Dennis,

Thanks for the link... I ordered plans for the Aquasub by RJ Riley awhile back and he uses a very unique elec. system. The batteries are completely enclosed in a watertight seal using a device to eat hydrogen throwoff. (cheap to make). He uses 2 6volt golf cart batteries to power an exhaust fan and 2 trolling motors and claims to get 4 hours of continuous power motor. I would mainly be using sail, using the electric motor only when needed. I was thinking of either a small movable wind turbine or a combo of solar and generator for power-replacement. The batteries could be mounted on a small plank and moveable to pre-positioned brackets to act as ballast.

Here is a link for a very small genny, http://www.wisesales.com/YamahaEF1000iS.html , but I have seen one almost half this size that was 5oo watts..... also someone posted in the files section a peddle charger...looked kewl.. Thats enough outta me til I get the plans. (no sense in lookn like too big a dumba$$, heh)
