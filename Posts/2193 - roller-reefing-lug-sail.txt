Subject: roller reefing lug sail?

Hey folks,

I'm finishing up my Bolger Micro Navigator which I have fitted with a 200 square foot lug sail instead of the Chinese gaff cat yawl shown on the plans (too expensive and complex for short jaunts). The sail has three reef points in it but requires me to open the main hatch and hang out there to reef.

Is Paradox's sail specifically designed to furl smoothly? Can this approach be adapted to other lug sails? I've never seen the Paradox plans so I'm really unsure how it works.

Can someone explain the running rigging for the furler and how the drum is actually shaped? Is the tack line on some type of swivel or is there even one on Paradox?

Thanks,
Jason
