Subject: Unfolding Calamity for Enuf
To: paradoxbuilders@yahoogroups.com

Yesterday my son and I coated and sheathed the bottom of Enuf. This afternoon, 24 hours later, the epoxy hasn't set. I am so upset that I attacked my Land Rover with a cold chisel and finally removed a rusted nut that has been aggravating me for a year, but it hasn't helped the epoxy set! It must be that we got the mix wrong because the temperatures have been fine. My son has taken the blame so that's ok. If it isn't set by tomorrow I will have to strip it off. About =A3120 worth of materials wasted!
