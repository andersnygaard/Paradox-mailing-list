Subject: Re: Boom drilling

Hey, thanks to both of you. We are contemplating drilling a thick scrap of wood on a drill press, to use as a guide for a long quarter inch drill bit, and then enlarging the hole with the thicker but shorter bits that will get it to the right size. It's comforting to know that folks have been doing it freehand -- and that if it comes out a bit off, it is still likely to work okay!

I did see the previous posts about the tang at the clew end getting into trouble. So I did get a heavier one, an eighth of an inch thick. I'm curious if the ones that bent were originally twisted 90=B0, like in the plans? I have indeed twisted the one that I got, and think that perhaps this will add some rigidity... it wasn't hard to do with a big vise and a pretty big pipe wrench. Of course maybe that means it'll be happy to get bent in use, so we'll see what happens...

And I originally made an assumption that the bolt in the clew end of the boom is a lag, even though it shows a slotted head. So since I already now have a 4 inch stainless lag, I think that's what we'll try. Unless for one reason or another that's not likely to work out?

Thanks again,
Shemaya
