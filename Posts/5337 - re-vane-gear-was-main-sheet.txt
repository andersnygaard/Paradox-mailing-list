Well, I was interested in a vane because I have a strange feeling that after my boat is finished and I get tired of weekend trips to Catalina, one day I am gonna wake up and begin preparations for a trip to Hawaii in it. I half hope I am wrong. But.... In the very least I might trailer her up for the drive to the gulf and go to the Bahamas. I think it would be great if we had a big ass "Paradox" get-together someplace in 2010.

Just to add my 2 pence to the discussion.

As the Paradox tracks so well I would be tempted to build a system with a small separate rudder, not connected to the boat's main rudder. Then the course would be set using the main rudder, which would be locked off, and the vane rudder would apply small corrections to keep the course true. This would mean that the vane system would not need to be nearly as powerful as one which could control the main rudder.

I would then investigate mounting the whole assembly on the fore deck where there is no problem of fouling the rig. Is there any reason why a rudder over the bow wouldn't work?

Having said that, I see no need for a Paradox self steering system unless you want to sleep while sailing.
