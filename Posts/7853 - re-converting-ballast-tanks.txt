Hello Phil,

Alastair here. I had no issues launching and recovering with the ballast installed. The trailer did not show any indication of suffering. However, my personal preference was to lose the extra weight and, once the pumps were sorted out, it was a simple process.

Hoping for calm nights.

Best regards,
Alastair Law
