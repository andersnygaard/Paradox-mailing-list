Subject: Ironside revisions and progress

Today I discovered that the tackstrop pins which had cotterpins acted like fishooks and snaged the rope I setup for reefing. So I reworked the design and made fewer pieces and made new pins which use snaprings. This also fixed the overlong issue the old design had. 

I repainted the gray cabin sole to a tan color and installed it. I installed the foam insulation in the cabin and screwed down the varnished liner panels over both sides. The foam just "floats" between the hull sides and the liners. It's a snug non-moving fit. Now bulkhead 3 has no intrusion into the look or feel of the cabin. Just as I visualized it. 

I made an aluminum bracket to hold the mainsheet cam cleat and mounted it. I made a deck-block to hold the for end of the yuloh. I fitted the tiller with it's blade lifter jam cleat and fairlead. I mounted the side deck "arches" to hold the sail and yuloh. I made three rope fairleads out of delrin and fit them in their holes. The end is in sight. I put up a few photos too. I'm itching to launch!
