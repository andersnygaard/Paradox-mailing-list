Subject: Re: Appraisal of a Paradox Sailboat

Bill,
Thanks for posting your appraisal, it's interesting to hear your thoughts on the boat now that you have had some sea time onboard her.
Thanks aso for you log updates. Hope you've got some new glasses now after your swim!

I've always thought it slightly strange that the sail is flown on the port side of the mast. Logic tells me that things would be more symetrical if flown from the starboard side of the offset mast.
I wonder if doing so would help reduce the problems of missing stays when going from stbd to port tack?
The only problem I see in doing that would be the angle of the lead through for the furling line, but that could be rectified with a couple of small blocks; the halyard would be no problem.

I'm sure Matt has addressed these ideas when he designed Paradox, so I expect his plans are the best way to do it!
