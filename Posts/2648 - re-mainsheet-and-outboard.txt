Subject: Re: Mainsheet and outboard

Thanks again Jeff

I appreciate your points on the demerits of a motor and I intend to use a yuloh as well. As my outboard is an old Seagull without clutch or reverse, but fairly light, the yuloh will have some advantages particularly for docking. I am, however, diabetic and just don't have the ability to exercise for extended periods. Besides that, I guess that the motor is likely to make better headway against contrary winds or tides than any amount of yulohing.

Cheers  ......  Derek
