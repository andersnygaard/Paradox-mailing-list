Light hoist in the topping lift... thats a great idea. I believe after my boat is finished it may take quite awhile before I get up the nerve to sail at night. I was worried in the beginning about finding a boat to build that would get me to Catalina Island. I have to laugh at myself now that I know alittle more.... three young adults from ages 11-13 will each pilot an 8 ft open boat (olypmus, i think) from the Marina del Rey to Catalina Island next month. They will each be single piloting their own boat. Now.... there will be chase boats within 50 feet of each contender but still.... I am both impressed and relieved. :)
