The smaller the boat you can get by with is always the best bet!

I truly love the Bolger St Valery...A work of art! Problem is not quite the accommodation I need for full time live aboard and cruising... While I really love a lot of Bolgers stuff I am not a big fan of the slot tops.

Chris Morejohn has a lot of designs in his back pocket including a Hogfish 18 which is really sweet...
