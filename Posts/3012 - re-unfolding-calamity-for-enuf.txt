All these comments assume, of course, that this isn't a new supply of resin and hardener that has never been used before and "could" be contaminated or even incorrectly marked on the can.

That's what the suggestion was about regarding mixing a sample batch on scrap wood. If the resin/hardener chemistry itself is bad, then no amount of voodoo alchemy is going to rescue the process at this point, no matter how hard you try.

If it's the same old, successfully used, resin from earlier in the process, then the issue is about mixing or any possible subsequent contamination from your end of the ownership... or both.

Most chemistry suppliers will warrant their product, and only their product. You'll be out the glass cloth and the time without a lawsuit to badger them into springing for the cloth and that's a silly waste of resources for such a small amount. Better to move along to another supplier if that's the case. This part of the discussion is waaaay ahead of the curve at this point, though.

Let us know what you end up doing, Derek.
