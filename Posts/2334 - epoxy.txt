Subject: Epoxy

Greetings All,

I've been debating over this Epoxy/Fiberglass thing for quite some time now. After searching and reading everything I could find on Fiberglass/Epoxy--I now believe that Fiberglass {Polyester}is NOT the way to go. I don't want all My hard work on The Paradox to go up in "Bubbles".

I ordered a Catalogue from "West System Epoxy" tonight and am waiting anxiously for it to come---already {:> I posted some more Pics of my Paradox on page four, but, I need to upload the "Big" Pics yet. [I'll try to do that tomorrow}

I usually post new photos every other day or so, Depending on how much I get done on the Boat.

Thank You,
Dave Blow
