Subject: Re: Time to build and cost?

Steve, whatever you will be a compromise in many ways and will probably only be ideal in a few.  I too love the Paradox lines.  For myself, I choose the Philsboat, again as a compromise.  I wanted something to "sail from inside" (like the Paradox), but the paradox is only suitable for a single person (or tow intimate skinny ones, but no more).  Again, there will always be some compromise.

In the end, building is loads of fun (for me at least).  And whatever you build will only be good a some things, not all.  It took me 5 months of research, and mental flip-flopping to make my mind up. Once you do, and start building, the fun starts all over again.   Not to minimize the importance of the decision, but try to take it all lightly.  After all, its your enjoyment of it that counts, the end result is just a by product of the trip (and one you can sail in)!

Yes, the Philsboat looks frumpy.  I am looking forward to giving all the clone Bermuda rigged sailors something to talk, and snicker about!   Look at all the enjoyment I'll bring to the other sailors on the lake, by floating something so bazaar!   I think I might just name her "FreakShow"!
