Anyone have a list of the non plywood lumber , and the amount of fiberglass cloth needed to complete paradox. 
I cannot start building for a few months because of a recent surgery but want to get everything together and also put more thought into whether the stock size paradox will be large enough for me.

Not really an answer, but don't worry too much about the sections of things like the cleats on the bulkheads. I made all my bits to the millimetre whereas anywhere within about 5mm would be close enough. if I were building again I would get a lot of large stock and cut it to size as required with a table saw.
