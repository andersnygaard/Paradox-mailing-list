Hello,

I'm curious about the type and thickness of wood typically used to fabricate deck and cabin beams. Would it be possible to use multiple layers of 1/4" or 3/8" plywood instead? It seems like the curve and epoxy would provide sufficient strength, and strips of plywood would be easier to bend than regular wood.

Thank you for your input.

Best regards,
Pete Hodges
