Hello Gary,

I am actually just coming to the end of new boat build which I plan to take cruising after selling everything I own ashore, so not after another boat just at the moment, thanks for the offer.

To be honest I thought long and hard about taking Small Fry for my proposed cruise, but without a shore base to store anything that would have meant more downsizing than I am ready for just yet. If I was only to be away for a year and could store some things ashore Small Fry would have been a good option.

Anyway, a bit more of the story, the picture attached shows Small Fry anchored in Jurien Bay. The area accessible to conventional boats is a bit so so, but a little further out to the south west it is possible for a Paradox to get into the anchorage pictured in about a foot or so of water. A beautiful and sheltered anchorage which I recommend to anyone heading north in their ultra shoal draft cruiser after a good sail from Fremantle. Small Fry has used this anchorage on several occasions always having the whole area entirely to herself.

Small Fry, Fremantle.
