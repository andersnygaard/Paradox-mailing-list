Sorry to hear about your shed and, more importantly, your boat.

The only thing I would do differently in the early stages is to not bother as much about getting the size of the cleats accurate. I got much of the wood planed to the sizes specified, and it really wasn't necessary, they would have been fine with the extra wood left on.

But do get the ply bulkheads the right shape, then everything else will follow.

My Paradox-in-progress (early stages) and my boat shed were destroyed by large trees which were knocked down in a violent windstorm last New Years Eve. Though I did plan on starting over right away, I guess devastation and disappointment killed my enthusiasm - until now. I'm starting to cut out pieces again.

My question is - Now that I have a chance to start over, is there anything I need to know about the beginning stages of building that has changed or been discovered in the last 6 months or so? Anything you would do differently if you had a chance to start over?

Thank you

Hoping for calm nights
