Subject: Building a sharpie article
Date: Fri, 22 Feb 2002 15:10:57 -0800

FWIW, there's an article on building a sharpie on the WEST System Epoxy page. It doesn't have a separate URL, so here's how to find it:

http://www.westsystem.com/
Click on "Epoxyworks Magazine" at the top.
Click on "Epoxyworks Back Issues"
Click on "Epoxyworks Number 15 Spring 2000"
The article is called "Building a Wood/Epoxy Sharpie"

It doesn't look like the construction is exactly like a Paradox, but there might be some useful information there.

If you're looking for a somewhat more ambitious project, there's also an article on the largest wood/epoxy ship built: a 213' 3 masted barque.
