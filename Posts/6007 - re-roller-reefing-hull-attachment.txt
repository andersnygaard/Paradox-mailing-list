Subject: Re: Roller reefing hull attachment?

Jim,

The line is not continuous but if it were it could take up a little clutter.  The roller furler spool line can be much smaller because there is a big mechanical advantage but it also takes a lot of line.  The halyard needs to be low stretch but the roller boom makes it very easy to tension the luff of the sail which is, as you know, essential for a lug sail performance.

The sequence is 1) Raise the sail with the halyard letting the boom roll. 2) Cleat the halyard. 3) Tension the sail with the roller boom.Done.  Just reverse the three to reef.keeping some drag or tension on the halyard to keep it from dropping.  It is a learned skill but not difficult after a few attempts.  

Keep in mind that the complexity of the roller attachment to the deck is to quickly and easily move the boom to the side of the boat off of the cabin (or cockpit).

A small bucket or just leaving the line on the bottom will prevent tangles in the line if it is left alone, just as it comes off the boom or sail. Once you disturb the pile of line, it can tangle.
