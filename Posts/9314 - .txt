Subject: Poling the Paradox

Here=E2=80=99s something you may want to try when taking the Paradox into shallow water=E2=80=A6 poling.

As an outdoor professional and former canoe instructor, canoe poling in rapids is a skill I have under my belt.  I have found that the same techniques can be used to scoot the Paradox along in shallow water by using the yuloh as a pole.  Now the yuloh as a pole is a tad short (we use a 12 foot pole on a canoe), but it is still long enough to be serviceable.  The yuloh also has a bend in it, contrary to a canoe pole.  The trick is to place the convex of the curve facing outside so the yuloh poles under the boat somewhat and the blade is parallel to the boat. 

This poling technique is very powerful and has gotten me out of trouble on numerous occasions.  It permits moving the boat upwind without the sail in shallow water and the technique has freed me from groundings too, since poling backwards is possible.

I suggest you may want to practice this along a beach in controlled conditions until you can pole and turn the boat left and right as you do so (with rudder completely up).  This is my goto method for slowly entering tiny creeks in very shallow water to find a quiet parking spot for the night.  You may even want to try it in a canoe first, a good canoe instructor can be helpful here.

Hope this helps.
