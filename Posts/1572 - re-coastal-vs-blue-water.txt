Subject: Re: Coastal vs Blue Water

How so? Chine runners vs: centerboard? Lugsail vs: split sail plan? 
Double ender vs: transom stern? Not sure how those are considered 
material philosophies instead of design.

As for the volume of a square stern vs: bouyancy of a canoe type 
stern, I tend to agree with you but I'm not sure Sven would. 
Otherwise why did he go with a double ender?

I see two possible reasons:

1. There would tend to less weight and therefor more bouyancy in a 
canoe stern simply because there is less tendency to overload a canoe 
stern and it is therefor better able to rise easly in a following sea 
and not get pooped.

2. There is a Norsk prejudice towards double enders, perhaps not 
shared by you and I and John Welsford.

But it is mostly conjecture in any case unless Sven were to share 
more openly his design philosophy. I know he did at some length share 
it with Bjorn Harbo and that is what I am basing my observations on. 

Sven looked far and wide for another material rather than divinycel 
and the epoxies he uses because they are so darned expensive. But he 
could find nothing quite as good that met his personal testing 
procedures. (The sledge hammer test:-)

So that was not a materail decision but instead a decision based on  
his design needs. Another significant factor being the insulating 
properties needed where he was sailing - in the north sea.

Many of these properties are probably not required for folks who sail 
in warmer waters and closer to land. In fact we may find his designs 
unsuitable for other reasons that are the exact opposite to his 
requirements. Like sailing in New Zealand or the Bahamas.
