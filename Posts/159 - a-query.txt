HI folks,

How many Paradoxes are there out there? A better question, could those on the list with a Paradox (state under construction, under sail etc) come back with a message. I know of Al in sunny England is building one, Glen has Zoe in the water, Don Elliot has his.... any more people?

Just curious.

PS. Got all my plywood on Saturday - damn expensive stuff, all up cost $AUS790 for all ten sheets. Pacific Maple marine ply, absolutely no voids guaranteed.

Now, just have to get those cobwebs and leaves out of my workshop and get started....
