Subject: Re: flat bottom slap

Originally I had the same concern but I found this not to be the case. 
My boat is trimmed down to waterline and I never had an issue with slapping under sails, or on anchor, or motoring in the choppy waves in the inlets. 
It's a Paradox.

The devil's advocate on this one: does the flat bottom of the Paradox result in the sole slapping when at anchor? 
A member of the microcruiser group presumes a V bowed boat would prevent this happening.
