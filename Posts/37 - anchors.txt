I'm still struggling with the anchor stowage. I have a problem stowing it below because so many times I have pulled up a smelly anchor and the thought of putting one below tends to roll my stomach. As it stands now I will probably go as designed and see if it is really a problem. Must not have been for Matt as he lived aboard for so long, if it had been much of a problem I think he would have catted it out on the bow.

I believe Dave Bolduc, on Little Cruiser, uses a Danforth as his main anchor, but keeps a 4lb Fortress on the bow roller for short stops. This sound good to me as I tend to do short hops with lots of stops, although I think I would have a fishermans rather than the Danforth. I am impressed with the Bruce I have on my motor cruiser, but can't see how it could be stowed aboard Paradox.

Hoping for calm nights
