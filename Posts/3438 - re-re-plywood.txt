Is exoxy made from oil? I think it might be hence the steep price hike.

Hi Derek.
Where did you get these prices from.
I will be looking to buy epoxy soon and I have been qouted as much as 113 a gallon.
MAS epoxy in the UK seems to have dissapeared off the net and I cannot find their receipt from my last order with them.
I use to use SP but since the"suits" took over I have to order from the mainland although SP are only a few miles from me on the island, so I don't.
When they first started up I could just walk in, pay cash and get a discount. Not any more.
Local stores only stock repair kits. Useless.
