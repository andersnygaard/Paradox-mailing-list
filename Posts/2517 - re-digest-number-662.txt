Hi folks,

Where can we find out more about this Hogfish Maximus? Thanks in advance.

Aaron

Chris wanted me to stress the fact that while the Hogfish Maximus is similar to what an enlarged Paradox would look like, it is not a scaled up version but a product of his own design efforts which were arrived at from a different learning curve then the one Matt Layden used. Another distinction that he wanted to make is that these boats are not sharpies in that traditional sharpies have low sheers, low centers of gravity and different sailing qualities, thus the term "Modified Sharpie".

Must get back to the farm work now but I promise to get back to the trip report.
