Hello Group,

Harold "Dynamite" Payson has a large and informative website which you might like to see at http://www.instantboats.com/

He has recently revived some older plans of "Down East" and Texas Dory's and the link is on his home page or you can go here http://www.instantboats.com/downeastdories/

You can order study plans for most boats CHEAP as low as 50cents a copy.. directions how are on his order form. You can't beat that price with a stick! I have ordered several already.

Regards,

Andrew

Hi Cathy,

If ordering the Tortoise plans from Dynamite Payson, I suggest you also pick up his latest book as well. Tortoise and PDR are pretty much the same boat.
