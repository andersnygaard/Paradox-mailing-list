Subject: Re: Steel?

I made a mistake in my previous post. The Bolger design in 1/8" steel plate. And he claims it is equal in weight to 11/2 inch mahogany.

Would be great to get some weight estimates with 1/10" and 1 inch tubing for the chines and deck beams and clamps? Would it not tend to oil can on the bottom - or would it be heavier plate?

Sounds interesting.
