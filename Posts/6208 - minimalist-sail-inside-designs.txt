The problem with your proposal, at least from my point of view, is that you are simplifying the parts that are already simple while leaving the hard parts hard.

Chine runners still look to me like one of the harder parts of Paradox, at least in comparison with simple leeboards or a drop-down daggerboard a la PDRacer.

On the other hand, I have no qualms about building a deck and cabin for a box-boat -- simple!
