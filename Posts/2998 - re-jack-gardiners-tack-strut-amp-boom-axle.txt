I've an idea that Don maybe doing this and looking in here. He seemed to know of my need for ballast advice.

Anyway, I've said it before and I'll say it again, he is a Paradox builder and sailor - there are few enough of those - and he has some very useful contributions to make. He has never been anything but helpful to me and I'm very grateful for that.

Also, I'm very grateful for the help I've received from, among others, Nels, Chris, Bill, David, Jack, Dave, et al. Some of it Paradox specific and some general on building, sailing and life. It is great to have access to all this knowledge.

As I am getting closer to launch I realise that I couldn't have done it without you (cue tear on cheek, sweet violins gently weeping) so a big thank you - and keep the info flowing!

Cheers all  .....  Derek

ps I've always had an interest in surname origin and just in the names that I've mentioned we have French, Swede, Norwegian?, and Anglo-Saxon. Is Molduc East European?
