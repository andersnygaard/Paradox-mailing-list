I am not doubting the stability of the paradox, having built and sailed it. The point im trying to make is that in the case of Sudden High Intensity Training, S.H.I.T. like the rare outside event of being seperated from the deck of the boat in unfavorable conditions, seas, wind, current, wakes, I dont care how stable the boat is, it will be moving, and so will the person that has to reboard the vessel. Take for example I like to free dive and S.C.U.B.A, often times when you return to the boat the conditions have changed, and hauling the gear and myself over less obstacles the better, the location seems to fall somewhere around my shins and knees as I would climb over. I guess for me its just a personal preference. I feel it is a very dangerous place to be at the wrong time, and thats when you need it the most to be safe. plus thats where I sit to prep to dive. Anyway, it will be nice to find out how it works out, good luck!
