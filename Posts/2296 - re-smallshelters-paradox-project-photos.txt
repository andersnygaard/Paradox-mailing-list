Hi Dave,

You should definetely NOT use epoxy if you have developed a sensitivity to it. That could have serious consequences.

I would consider using a good brand of waterproof glue and ring nails and hire someone to glass the hull for me. The other option is to use polyester resin but it may be toxic to you as well.

Why on earth do you want to strip plank it? What would be the advantage to that? One thing I have considered for a sharpie bottom is to use tongue and groove flooring athwartship then laminate a thin layer of plywood to it on the exterior bottom and then glass over it.

That way you would have a nice hardwood floor inside and it would also provide insulation and something to nail to:-)

Cheers, Nels
