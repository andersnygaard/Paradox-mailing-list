I had my Hirondelle on a random axle unbraked trailer and it worked fine my Paradox trailer doesn't have brakes

I'm looking into buying a trailer at the moment.
My first idea was to have an extendable tongue or perhaps a
hinged arm attached to the drawbar that I can use at launch
time to get the trailer deeper into the water.  I was
going to have transverse bunks under bulkheads 2 and 4 and
float the trailer onto them (my last boat had that system,
but it didn't have ballast and it was multichine with
stitch and glue).  Now that I've started
considering ballast, perhaps this isn't the best
way.  Should I have a transverse bunk under bulkhead 1
and two longitudinal bunks centered under bulkhead 3 and the
chines? Once the water ballast is removed will she sit nose
up enough to not need a guide up to the bulkhead 1 bunk?
Transverse bunks could be made in a U shape to automatically
secure the boat once she's on the trailer. Longitudinal
bunks won't do that so I would have to use ties downs to
keep her on the trailer.

There's pros and cons to both arrangements. What do you
think?

Cheers,

Rob

PS:  Jim... please don't suggest a design that
involves unloading the boat onto the slipway and waiting for
the tide ;-)
