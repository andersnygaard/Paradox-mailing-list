Subject: SAIL

Hello friends, 

At the start of construction Cachivache decided that it was possible to craft more, so I would also build the sail. That's why I appeal to the friends of the group with a query. The candle is completely flat or take any bag or curve in any of their cloths? 

We thank you very much for all the help that here are giving me to get a good construction
