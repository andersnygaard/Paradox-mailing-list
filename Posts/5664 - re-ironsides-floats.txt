Ron,
You're welcome to come and see Raffles. Just write to me off-forum and we'll set something up. Regarding ballast, I didn't want to have toxic lead around me or my young son so I ended up using steel weights used for weight lifting. Obviously they take up more space but I consider the trade-off was worth it. Also it is possible to buy them in a variety of different sizes and weights and can easily be rearranged and resecured to obtain better trim.
