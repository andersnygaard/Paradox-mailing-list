Kellan, you of all people would have no problem building a Paradox... as you have noted if you approach it like eating a elephant, ie one bite at a time, if you look at the whole meal you will want to throw up, it will eventually be finished. Good luck with the project. and yes Don's book is still available from his wife and is worth the read.

Is it still possible to get a copy of Don's Paradox build manual? I've been trying to talk myself out of launching into a big project right now but I can't stop thinking about Paradox. I've owned the plans for years and the eventuality of it keeps looming larger and larger in my skull. I find elements of the plans a bit enigmatic (no pun intended) and wondered if there is good information to glean from Don's book and maybe even a good plan of attack. If I can keep from getting too obsessed and break the project into a series of small tasks over a year or two I'm sure I can squeeze it out of my crazy schedule.
