Thanks guys.

I have looked at the fafnir, but I like the almost no draft of the paradox for when sailing and wanting to beach on a sandy spot. THe Fafnir is definitely better for blue water cruising and looks easier to build.

Most of you say that the average building time for the paradox is 1000 hours, that sounds a lot for a boat of only 13'. Why is it so much?
