Hi Al,
Are you sure your battery is only 12Kgs? Seems very light for 80AHr...
Cheers,
Alan. 

Al,

I hope not, as it is what I have done. I have fitted an 80AH AGM battery (12kg) just forward of bulkhead 3 where it sits nicely in the gap between the water tank and the side. It sticks up into the living space, but doesn't get in the way. I use it to drive a small trolling motor which will push me about 8 miles at 2 knots. The motor is normally stored inboard (beware of proximity to compass). I have used it only rarely as I prefer to use the yuloh for short distances, but when I have used it I have been very glad to have it. Of course it powers/charges all my other electronics as well.

Hoping for calm nights,
Al,      
Yeovil, England.
