Subject: Re: How heavy is a fully loaded and ballasted Paradox?


Chuck is quite an example - I've met him.

Take one pound of lead in any shape you care to make - let it float (it won't of course, unless it's been made into a shape that encloses some volume).

Take one pound of foam in any shape you care to make - let it float. Most of the foam will be above water I think most would agree, depending on the shape it's in. The volume of water displaced is the displacement and it's the weight of this water that's quoted as a vessel's displacement, NOT the weight of the material that's doing the displacement. Thus, a boat can displace more then it weighs.
