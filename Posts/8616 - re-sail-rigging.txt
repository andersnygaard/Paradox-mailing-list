Hi,

I made my mast round and hollow, a birds mouth mast. I had a boat builder make the staves and I planed and sanded it. It was an expensive build made from hoop pine. It's about 20 lb too. Here it is after a day's sailing.

Would an aluminium mast be lighter? They make mast sections, and they are not prohibitively expensive. Just fashion a wooden foot that fits the mast box.
