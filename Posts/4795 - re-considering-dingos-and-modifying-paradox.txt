Subject: Re: Considering Dingos and Modifying Paradox

What would be wrong with a paradox built 10%-20% larger yet with all the internal details of the original paradox. 

I am a big guy and have had Paradox plans for a couple years now and always built other boats because of the negative feedback on modifing the original design. There is no other boat that I have found that has the features that paradox has.
