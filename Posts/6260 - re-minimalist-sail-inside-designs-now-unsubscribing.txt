Computers!!!!!  I'm thinking it is because I have selected to get my  
email in the fancy format, html I assume.  If I were to change it to  
text then there couldn't be links in the emails, at the most they  
could write out the links...

My emailed posts have the link to unsubscribe.  The most unread part  
of my emails.  I almost never go to the web site to read posts, only  
photos and files...

Sincerely,
Gene T.

Thomas,
You need to do it yourself.  Go to the very bottom of this page on  
the far right and click on "un subscribe" and take it from there.
