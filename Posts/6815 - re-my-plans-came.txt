Subject: Re: My plans came

It's good to hear that the plans arrived safely, and make sure to take adavantage of all the great resources that are available in this forum. 
Quite a few people here have already completed their own Paradox micro-cruisers, and they can guide you through any rough spots should you encounter them.
