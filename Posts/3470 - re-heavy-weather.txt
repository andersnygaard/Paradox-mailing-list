Others may be able to give you a more detailed description. The most I have seen on open water was a F5 quartering to beam wind. I had a little too much sail up at the time, but I just pointed to where I wanted to go and let it punch through the waves. The control is the same whether you are in or out.

Oh, and I don't hunker down, I sit in state. (Often reading a book)
