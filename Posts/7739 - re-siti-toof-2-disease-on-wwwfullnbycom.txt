Hi Sean,

Just read the recent post on your website. You described me perfectly, so much so it hurt. LOL. I was one of those stupid beginners who scared off his wife, too late now. If others care about sailing with their partners, I suggest you religiously heed Sean's advice.

Truly enjoyed your post Sean. Wonderfully said. You are now my hero. An inspiration!

PS Just picked up my Paradox in Washington after driving across the continent from Québec, will be heading south on the weekend, looking for warmer weather to try it out. Will let you all know how my first sails go.
