Sean, 

I bought Steve Yahn's "Ironsides" before he passed away. Got to meet him briefly, really nice guy, and the boat looks great.

I will be passing thru Phoenix in early January. Hopefully we will be able to connect. Will let you know as I get closer.

It's hard to make mods while on the road! I need to change the two sliders for the hatch... Other than that and a good paint job, the boat was well built and is in great shape. I'm thinking of renaming it to Nogaz, because I hate gas engines, but maybe I'm spitting in the air here. Might commit to Alistair's philosophy and store an electric motor in the front cubby. But I'm putting the cart before the horse. I have to learn to sail this thing first!

Cheers!
