Your best bet is, 

Go with what you can afford. take into consideration, How you intend to use the boat, will you be skinning the outside in glass?? What type of paint are you considering?? degree of finish?? work boat quality/show, I used good quality exterior fir, skinned it in 2 oz glass, double layer in many places, used good quality exterior fir 3/4 " for the floor and went one layer of 12 oz biax on the bottom, I use the boat in Bay/Ocean/River invorment, I have a 6 hp motor on it and power sail alot in it. I have ran her right up onto the beach, with moderate sized rubble and have not damaged the bottom at all. I have found that using this grade of plywood is acceptable. I also used the stich and glue, tabbed, fillet route for construction. A good rule of thumb is best you can afford, with a bottom line of quality and common sense. alot of the framing I used mahogany and oak. Also as a tip, If your not familiar with the grading of plywood, you will want to be before shopping. ie A/A A/B A/C B/C C/DX

 Face Grade / Backside Grade
A/A is A grade both faces A/B is A face with a B backside

 Your Sailing area sounds great, I think the Paradox would truly shine in those conditions.
