Subject: Outboard Modification.

I have made a sketch of an idea for a "line fender". Where the red line is drawn I imagine a brass or stainless rod fastened onto the engine. It may make the tangles a bit less eh...complex. I copied some random photo of the motor from the net and then drew a sketch onto it.

I may try this if I can avoid making too many holes.
