Subject: Bloody chine logs AGAIN!
Date: Sat, 27 Nov 2004 15:12:28 -0000

After a 3 week lay off for sickness, table saw fettling and Land Rover repairing I am now fitting the chine logs. I have two peices of shaped sapele each 19mm thickish from pre burning out my saw. I cut 20mm slots in the bulkheads just, forced home a length of sapele (curves ok in the length but very reluctantly in the depth), looked at what is a large piece of wood and thought, "why does this need to be 38mm?"

It just doesn't make sense. I still can't see that it does more than provide a nailing surface for side to base and a wider glueing surface than 12mm to 18mm ply. Shane Acton circled the globe twice in a 9mm ply boat that I believe was only stitch and glued.

I can't help but think that paradox is massively over engineered and perhaps a reflection of the time it was designed. Would John Welsford, Paul Fisher, et al not use stitch and glue and probably not even ring nails if designing a small coastal cruiser today?

Feel free to comment but unless I hear a very good reason for 38mm chine logs 19mm it will be. Even though it means the new table saw isn't needed for awhile. Don't tell the wife.

Thanks for any thoughts....Derek
