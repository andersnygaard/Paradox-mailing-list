I've just posted a video from my experiments sailing to windward when reefed (scandalised in my case, since I'm using a sprit rig). Each time I go out the variables are different - wind speed, chop, currents, boat weight, rigging setup and even my personal state of mind!

These things make it difficult to obtain consistent results that I would consider reliable, but the video is here https://youtu.be/fTiTmxz4jDI anyway.
