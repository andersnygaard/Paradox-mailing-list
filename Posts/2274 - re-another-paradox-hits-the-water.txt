Subject: Re: Another Paradox hits the water

Congratulations Jack!  You'll love sailing Paradox.  Don't hesitate 
to ballast her up to her full cruising displacement (9" draft).  
This little boat loves the weight, and it's important to keep the 
chine runners submerged as deeply as possible to maximize the boat's 
windward performance.
