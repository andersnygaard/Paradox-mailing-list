Fitting a motor to Paradox brings a number of compromises, and must be considered separately for each case. I have opted for a side mounted electric motor which is stored inboard and is intended for emergency use only (or getting up the river to the lift out point at the end of a trip). Except for trials and end-of-trip use it mostly stays stowed.

I had seen that others mounted their fuel on deck. I would be wary of this as I have, on several occasions, had green water washing over the decks. I wouldn't be sure that the can would stay there. Similarly I would not be too happy to leave a motor on the transom where it may get swamped.

This, however, is just me going into conditions that are a bit silly, and I tell myself, every time, that I won't do it again. If you have more sedate cruising grounds you may see things differently.

Paradox is a great boat, but don't get blinded by the hype. If you want a boat, make a list of your requirements then find the boat that best fits them. Don't try to distort one boat into doing what another already does better.
