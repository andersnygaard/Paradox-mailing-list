How would you go about heaving-to in a paradox?

Probably the easiest way without deploying a sea anchor or drogue would be to reduce sail to the minimum and sheet the boom to one quarter or the other, then slightly off-center the tiller towards the opposite side of the boom. In that position she may make very slight way, but fall off to leeward. Her drift may be about half a knot, but according to the wind strength.

All the above is not proven from experience by me, but it seems feasible. Please someone give it a try to see if it works.

Alternatively, the simplest method which will definitely work is to lower all sail and raise the rudder. The boat will then take up her natural position according to the wind and sea.

I would prefer the former procedure if it works, because the sail would provide some stability to the boat's movement and result in a more comfortable ride.

As I say, the first method is conjecture on my part, never having sailed a boat with a single standing lugsail.
