Subject: Air-x wind generators

The generators work fine, I have been around a lot of them and the only thing I find objectionable is the noise they generate when the winds go over 20 kts and the blades start to unload them selves, a horrible racket, no way I would be able to live with one if it could not be tethered. They do have a brake which sort of works, they reverse to current so that in effect the generator becomes a motor but the wind keeps it from turning.
