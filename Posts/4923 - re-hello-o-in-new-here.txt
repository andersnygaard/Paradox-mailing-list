Yes, I did consider something of the sort, but it gets *much* more complicated to repair in a remote anchorage. The best I could come up with was an aft-facing tiller, but it has to be long enough to clear the main sheet, and then the angle of the steering rope is a bit shallow. I think I will stick with what I have got :)

Hoping for calm nights
