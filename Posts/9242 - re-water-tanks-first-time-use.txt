Subject: Re: Water Tanks: First Time Use

A leaking water tank is definitely not what you want, but looking back through old threads, this problem comes up many times. Mine leaked quite badly too. Just another teething problem that you'll have to fix, Deric.

Probably won't be your last either. I'm constantly fiddling with something to try and get the boat into the most efficient configuration possible. It seems we all do, as Nick is doing now with his ballast. At least for us micro-cruisers, the fiddling isn't expensive.

But hey, it sounds like you've nailed yulohing, so that's worth celebrating!

I like reading your trip reports. In fact, I like reading any kind of trip report (hint to anyone else sailing and not telling us about it), so keep them coming.

Cheers,

Rob.
