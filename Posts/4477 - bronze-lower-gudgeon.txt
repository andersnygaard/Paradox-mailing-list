Subject: Bronze Lower Gudgeon

Are there any clear photos of making the lower gudgeon for Paradox? Don Elliott's photos aren't very clear and I wondered if anyone else had better ones. Also, has anyone cast a bronze gudgeon in place of the glass-filled one? Any reason I couldn't or shouldn't cast one in bronze?
