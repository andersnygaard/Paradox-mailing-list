Subject: Re: Simpler Paradox alternative

Thanks for the teaser numbers and information on this unique Puddle Duck / Paradox combination. Take your time and have fun sailing but remember us when you get time.

I had never seen Scott's PDR before and had not even considered a rear cabin. You have my attention. I look forward to a few more details with dimensions and locations for the cabin. How is it steered? Lines like Paradox or just a tiller through the transom? Sail control lines?

I know the PDR is looked down on by many people as a floating cement mixing box or even a brick but I think it would work fine for my boating areas. My main draw to the Paradox is the sailing and camping INSIDE. Your version of a PDR might be an option.
