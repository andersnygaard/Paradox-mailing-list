I discovered that while the transom is shown with camber on its side panel edges, the camber was not specified. I incorporated 5mm of camber to these edges, as well as the side panel edges of bulkhead #4.

I've marked my transom with straight sides. Is this right? Should I add 5mm camber to it and Bulkhead 4? I'd like to get these finished during the week.

Have a look at this photo of 'Faith's' transome
http://www.smallsailboats.co.uk/paradox/build/stern_view.jpg
which has the 5m of curvature on either side.  I think it adds something to the appearance.  Others may perfer to have absolutely straight sides.

Tommorrow I'm going to rip some strips of 6mm marine ply and build a deck beam. If this is solid enough I will use marine ply for all the others.

I used ply for all of my beams.  Have a  look at:
http://www.smallsailboats.co.uk/paradox/build4.htm
and any of the early build pages from links there.

Another question. I've got quite a bit of stock kiln dried pine. I don't think it's normally recommended for boat building, but would it be any good for side and bin cleats etc.? If not I'll pick up some douglas fir at the weekend.

Try knocking some bronze ring nails of the right size into the pine to see if it splits.  If it does then buy the Douglas fir.

Bill.

On reflection that's not a good guide; I should have said pre-drill the pine before hammering in the nail.  I think it should be OK.

Thanks
