Subject: Knots for steering line

I'm not building a Paradox YET but thought this would be the best place to ask this question. I have looked at Don Elliot's build manual and also the Paradox plans and, although the plans show the gripping knots on the steering line, I found no mention of them at all.

What knot is everyone here using? Like a friend once said, I only know 1 knot but I can tie it a bunch of times. As close as I can come is one called the eternity knot https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpeaJKTw620.

Anybody have a nice looking, functional knot for use on the steering line?
