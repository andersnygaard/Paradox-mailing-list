Subject: Yuloh

I also, like Alistair, have moved the Yuloh pivot point back 6 inches. It now sits at 6 feet from the tip of the Yuloh, or 4 feet from the handle. Much more powerful, hardly ever use the original socket anymore. I come from a canoeing background (outdoor adventure professor), so the Yuloh was a natural for me. I even taught myself to use it left handed, much harder because the position is awkward. But it still works, and lets me use the Yuloh for hours without getting overly tired.

The Yuloh pushes the water backwards at a 45 degree angle, first on one side, then the other. You have to do a figure 8 to accomplish this. The difficulty for beginners lies in keeping back pressure against the water. When you don't, the Yuloh wants to float and pop out of the socket. At first, it helps to tie the Yuloh down with an elastic, but this is not necessary once you get the hang of it.

For canoeists, the movement is identical to when you move the canoe sideways to the left or right by pulling or pushing with figure 8 strokes.

As far as speed is concerned, I can keep up 2.5 km/hour for long stretches, over 4 km/hour for short spurts of a few minutes.

Hope this helps.
