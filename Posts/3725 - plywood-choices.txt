Subject: Plywood Choices

Hello All. 

I recently just started reading about the Paradox, and it has me excited about the possibility of potentially building one.  I was not even aware that a typ/class of boat like this existed.   I live near a very large lake (Pend Oreille in North idaho) with over 100 miles of shoreline.  I had a powerboat (18' fiberglass with a fuel gulping chevy 350) that I got board of and sold.  I like the idea of the paradox because I could "camp" in it.  I also like the idea of not dumping $100 bucks in it just to drive around for half a day.    The powerboat was only good in perfect weather, the paradox looks like I could use it much more of the year (IE windy weather).   North Idaho's very pretty, but has a typically northern cooler climate.  The ability to operate the paradox from an enclised cabin appears that it could be a winner.

Anyway, I'm wondering about plywood.  I have not ordered plans yet (I will this weekend).  Can someone build the paradox with cheap plywood, or is the fancy stuff mandatory?   I will probably keep it at the Hope marina for 6 months of the year, and in my barn during the winter.

If I build, I'm guessing the first thing I'll need to do is concrete one of the bays in the barn (it's currently gravel).  I'm guessing that having a level surface is mandatory while you are building the frame.  If I'm wrong please chime up!

Any comments would be helpful.

P.S. I wish I could just hit a website and paypal for the plans.  If I could, they would be here right now!
