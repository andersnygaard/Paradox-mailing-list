What weight and material pipe did you change over to Al?

Great solutions! That really alleviates any concerns for me. .,I will see if I can locate a photo but I think I already"get the picture". How about the tang assembly for the main sheet? I realize that end of the boom should be rounded off for less friction. Any refinements made to the bolt attachment?

Agreed
