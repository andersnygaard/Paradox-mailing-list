Hey David,

Thanks for taking me sailing across the channel this weekend it was truly exhilarating, your boat is a real miracle, I would never have believed even after knowing you all these years that you could build something as radical as you have, and you totally right it does look just like a 28 foot scaled up version of one of the baby paradox's on this site,  but with a rear cockpit area, well done old chap, she is really beautiful.

Don't suppose that we will be seeing much of you in England now your well and truly on you way to the Med, enjoy the Canal du Midi and the Wine, and don't get to bored, running so slowly on electric, you will soon be in the med, and away from the rat race,

Once again many thanks and best Wishes, Ashe
