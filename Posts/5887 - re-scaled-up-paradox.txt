Consider adding "water ballast tanks" you open the valve and let them fill when launched and open it and drain them to tow.. that's how Catalina does it.

At 6'2", I've inquired about the larger Paradox, too, but the idea of 
a displacement of over a ton fair takes my breath away.  It's certain 
my minivan couldn't tow it!  I'd much rather knock down the forward 
bulkhead and find a way to raise the cabin top on the stock design a 
few inches.

I have heard and correct me if I am wrong....it has been said
that Paradox can be scaled up by 20% without causing any
performance issues.

I am curious if anyone out there has scaled one up?
