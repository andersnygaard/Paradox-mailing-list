I'm still tweaking it John, in an effort to increase light air performance I have increased the leverage to the steering oar and am now in the process of making a balanced oar so the vane can turn it easier. Because of my wife's ailment I seldom get away anymore for more then a few hours when my daughter can come over and take care of her, so testing is dragging on but the results are encouraging.
