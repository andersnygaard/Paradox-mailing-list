Sean, 

You've obviously worked things out regarding working the rig, but I've noticed you furl the sail in the opposite direction to what is shown on the plans. I can see an advantage in doing this, because the luff is vertical, which helps when tensioning it. There may also be an advantage when sailing to windward on the starboard tack, because the tack will tend to stay closer to the mast.
