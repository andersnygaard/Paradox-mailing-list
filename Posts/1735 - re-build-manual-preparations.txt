Thanks for your input David.

I am encouraged that perhaps many people think the tool list I
compiled was outrageous. It was intended to be a suggested list, and
as such is comprehensive. It is up to the individual builder to decide
what is absolutely necessary, but each builder has different
requirements, both in terms of tool diversity and quality. My good
quality stationary powertools cost no more than $1200 new, but I have
not yet purchased a drillpress (another $300.00). I'm putting the
drillpress off until it is absolutely necessary; maybe next week,
perhaps next year.

I'm really disgusted by the modern outlook on tools, which calls for
lots of rosewood, brass, Japanese forging, lazer engraving, even
vented bass speakers for crying out loud(!!!), etc., etc... Tools are
meant to be used accurately, not admired on top of the mantle. And
there are those who would disagree.... I prefer to buy ancient tools
from old timer boatbuilders, not coffee table catalogs.

You are just as free to compile your own tool list, as you are to
compile your own materials list. I urge you to get started before
either are complete.
