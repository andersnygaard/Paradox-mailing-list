Hi Kjell.

A scab is just another way of saying "butt block", and is typically used when referring to plywood construction. I assume that the scab to which you refer, is the one on bulkhead #2. I was able to scarph my bulkhead together to entirely eliminate the scab, though my plywood is of a high quality which allows this (front and back veneers joined).

A note regarding bevels: I beveled every edge as shown on the plans, plywood and wood. I measured and marked all the bevels on the plans before cutting material. This was done on a bandsaw without difficulty, and resulted in nearly perfect fits (the sides of bulkhead #2 have a rolling bevel which is tough to get exact without lofting fullsize). I cut out the bulkheads and transom, and then cut out and added the cleats and floors. It takes just as much time to cut a bevel as it does square, so don't assume that I was unnecessarily anal. I prefer tight joinery to joinery-in-a-jar, though with epoxy, one is afforded a degree of leeway without much detriment. The degree of fit and finish is entirely up to the individual.

Have fun.
