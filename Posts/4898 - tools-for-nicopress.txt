Subject: Tools for Nicopress?


All,

What tools are we using out there to secure nicoress sleeves over stainless steel wire?

I have found only conflicting opinions and arguments after a godd deal of we searching. Here are the tool options I have found:

-Swaging tool from Bosun's Supply which looks like bolt cutters ($100+)
        (Inexpensive copy of nicopress # 1 tool?)

-Swage-It tool which looks like a walnut cracker using a wrench to apply force ($30+)

-More-Expensive Nico-Press No 1 Swaging tool which look like bolt cutters ($300+):

-Nicopress Bench mounted Hyrdraulic tool 3 635 (>$400)
-Nicopress # 510 or # 300 Bench Mounted manual tools(Price?)
