Subject: Re: Little Jim's new web home

Hi all,

A while ago I moved my building-Little-Jim web site to a new home. I recently noticed a site using the out of date web address, so I obviously haven't spread the word very effectively.

For the foreseeable future the correct web address will be <http://www.little.jim.freeuk.com>

If you have a link to my site on your website please check that it is up to date.

Thanks,

Hoping for calm nights

Hi Al,

Thanks for the new address. It opens up OK and works a treat, except when I use the back button to leave the new address:

http://www.little.jim.freeuk.com/little_jim/little_jim.htm

I'm finding the old address of:

http://www.as4jg.freeuk.com/little_jim/little_jim.htm

works just as well, without the problem of leaving the site by the use of the back button.

Does anyone have a similar problem when it comes to leaving the new site with the back button?

Bill.
