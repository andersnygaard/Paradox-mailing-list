So I'd  guess that a stainless steel ball working
within a copper cup would be a  reasonably good plan.

Or, the stainless ball in self lubricating epoxy  which
the others have mentioned. You don't really want to
use 
messy  old grease, there do you?

What you need is a teflon coated ball in a metal socket...that would have  
nice low friction...maybe find a place that will sell you a block of teflon and  
hack it down into a round shape,,,,drill a hole most of the way through to  
insert a metal rod for stength...ect....

Maybe you could find an old used artificial hip/joint..on ebay?
