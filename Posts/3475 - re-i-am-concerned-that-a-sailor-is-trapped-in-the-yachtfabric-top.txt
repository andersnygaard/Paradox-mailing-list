Subject: Re: I am concerned that a sailor is trapped in the yacht./fabric top

There have been some trailer-sailers done with pop-tops (like some motor-caravans), where the hard-top is somehow propped-up in a higher position when at anchor- some sort of 'scissor action' thingys perhaps? I feel that to be safe you really need a solid waterproof top if going out into rough water. One thing I'm considering is to hinge it at the forward end with fabric sides, and removeable as well. If there's a wash-board at the rear you could thus get in and out by lifting the rear-end of the hinged hatch/top. But then you can't stand-up when inside...Decisions, decisions.
