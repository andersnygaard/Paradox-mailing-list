Hello,
 
I am using construction grade Nordic spruce for most of the build. For the mast, I will be using carefully selected, knot-free spruce. I have tried not to use pine since it is more prone to rot. For the stem, I selected fairly knot-free pieces of construction grade spruce.

Best regards,
Andreas Westerberg
