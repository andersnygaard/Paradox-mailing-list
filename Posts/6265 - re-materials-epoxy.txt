I have used epoxy from polymerproducts. Do an Ebay search on that name, and you'll find their eBay store. I've been using their products for years and never had any issues. They were the cheapest I could find. Last I checked, it was about 40 per gallon, not including shipping.

Also, Matt built his boats with ACX ply, and we all know what he has done with his little boats. I have found that ACX can vary from complete crap, to as nice as any marine ply I have ever seen. Shop around, I have found some real excellent stuff, mostly at local lumberyards (I have never found good wood at the big box stores).

Good luck with your build.

I am going to (soon) begin purchasing materials

Is there a brand of Epoxy that I should avoid?

I am going with either West System, or System-3 unless I get advice to the contrary. Assuming my build will last from winter into summer, or with a late start, summer into winter... is there a suggested go/no-go brand or any other advice?
