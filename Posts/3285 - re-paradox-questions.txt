Do you know if they sell plans for the larger little cruiser boat, or the smaller Swamp Thing. i know that these were boats that lead up to the Paradox but one of theme might better suit my needs. Also do you know if there Is a material list for the Paradox listed anywere, mostly intrested in the amount of wood and epoxy needed.

Wayne, 

It is not really a boat for two. When sailing there is only room for one on the captains seat, so any passengers must stay below, not a disaster, but not as nice as being in the open on a nice day. 

Sleeping with two would be a cosy affair, but not impossible. More width can be gained by modifying the storage arrangements. I believe Kjell Karlsson has done this with his boat (as well as changing the build method from ply to composite sandwich) He has put some pictures in the files section, under Paraplastic, which include one with 2 people lying down inside. 

Have a look at http://www.smallsailboats.co.uk/ for information about all the Paradox builders in the known (internet) world.

Al, I looked over your site and the little boat looks good. I have built some wood kayaks, but have never sailed. Now I have an empty space in my garage and no ongoing projects so I might start to build one of these boats.The only problem I have with this boat is the limited sleeping space. it looks like it would be fine for one person but i dont know about 2 people in that small of a space.
