Thats two different answers......which I appreciate.  Do we have any way of knowing which is right?  It seems that there needs to be a little clarification on the plans or something to guide us.  The yuloh can be a very important part of a boat and I feel it needs to be
right.  The pictures that I've seen of the Enigma yuloh don't show it as being curved from one end to the other but rather only curved at the blade area.  I wish I knew which to do for sure.  Robb

Well, it may not be what Matt intended but I am happy that my yuloh works ok. I suspect it doesn't matter a great deal whether it is curved or not, or just curved at the ends.

Curving along the length makes it stow neatly.
