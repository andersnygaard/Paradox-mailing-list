Hi All,

I'm installing a proper 12 volt system on Whisper and was wondering if anybody could recommend a good solar panel? I'm also considering sailing without an outboard and was wondering how fast could Paradox be propelled using the Yuloh? (must stay out of the way of commercial traffic on the rivers I sail) Whisper did not come with one. (Next project) Any info will be helpful.

Thanks,
David Beard
