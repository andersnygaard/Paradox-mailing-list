Jeff;

Thanks for checking into those articles for me!

I think the one from July 1998 is the one that Roger Dongray sends (sent) out as a xerox copy when one orders the study plans by mail as I did. I had and may still have that issue  which is what turned me onto the Golant Gaffer in the first place, but it's not been sighted in a year or 3 literally, and I fear it's lost.

I suspect the 2001 issue is the one that Roger mentioned in an email to me the other day about the trip from the UK to Turkey via the European canal system in a GG.

Not likely at all that old issues of CB are going to be found around here. I have made an attempt to contact CB via their website, but they're _quite_ shy about being contacted I guess since there's not a contract email address in sight on their site. I don't read CB much anymore since Watercraft generally has many more articles to my liking compared to CB, which has gone after the fat cat's wallet like Woodenboat has in the US it seems to me. (Watercraft has made more of an effort to cater to the US market too, with back issue and subscription orders being serviced over here.)

Rather then put you to any trouble, i'd like to first see if those back issues can be purchased from CB before other avenues are explored. If you know of anywhere or can find out how to contact CB for back issues, i'd appreciate knowing about it.
