Hello friends,

The days Cachivache is to be launched. And  commented that a few blocks from my house I have the Chubut river in which to make interesting navigations.
The only problem is the low bridges and thought to make the mast hinged.
Anyone have any suggestions or ideas how?

Thank you very much,
Alberto
