Hi all,

Back to the eternal question on how to enlarge Paradox. My solution (?) has been to use the BRIS-material, thereby omitting foam insulation, and also to omit the lower shelves. Thus achieving a berth width equal to bulkheads' outer dimensions.

And this is how it turned out: four more photos have been uploaded to the Files section/ParaPlastic. (Glen, how do I reduce the pic-size in this section?).

I don't know yet from our hasty test-sleep if it is going to work, sleeping underneath the shelves. Therefore, I intend to make the aft shelf removable so that single-handed they are mounted, pair-sailing they are not. The foremost shelves do not seem to interfere much with any protruding body parts.
