Subject: Re: Next Question - rudder lock-down??

I added one item of my own to the rudder stock. When I wanted to lower the rudderblade it would not always go down. Even after decreasing the tightness of the pivot bolt. So I added a rubber padded lagscrew into the side of the rudderstock. This limited how high the blade could be raised. There was always enough weight on aft side of the center pivot.
