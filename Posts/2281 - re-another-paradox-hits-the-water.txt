Hi Paul, 

In picture JillBaby1, there is white table, you see a BIG high pitched aluminum prop, a very small shaft, a mounting clamp and a small gear head, the head has a gearbox in it and a ratchet, it clamps on a outboard mount and you lift the handle and at turns the prop, lower it and it ratchets, it was given to me by a friend that saw my boat and started laughing, he said, You need my polish outboard, no offense to any polish folks out there, to me its quite a mechanical marvel, so he dropped it off with a montgomery ward 1.5 hp gas outboard from what we figure the late 40's or early 50's, the thing runs, I said to him, do you know what this is worth? he just laughed and said look at this place you never sold anything, the outboard on the ground is a evenrude commercial work twin 40 hp, for my navy crrc, combat rubber raiding craft, a 16 foot seal boat, i havent used it much since 9/11 because the coast guard is on the lookout for anything like that, I dont need the hassle. anyway il take a good pic of the outboard and post it. I havent started my yuloh yet, but I will soon.

Jack
