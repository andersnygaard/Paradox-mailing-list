Meranti plywood to BS1088 standard is a good choice. It's of the highest quality, lighter than Okoume plywood and it's somewhat less expensive too. My wood expert friend says Meranti is a bit more rot resisant then Okoume, but they're both tropical hardwoods with 'the rot resistance of wet toilet paper' and must be well encapsulated with epoxy and the encapsulation must be maintained religiously. They will then last a long time (much longer then Fir given the same level of care). Plywood to the BS6065 standard isn't quite as good, but it's still quite good. Don't accept uncertified marine plywoods - the quality can be worse then construction plys.

If you want the cadillac of BS1088 plywoods and live on the east coast, Brunzeel (sp?) brand plywood, a Dutch-made product, is the very be$t.
