One time I was dreaming to try this. But I found out the single fare to Georgetown and one way fare from Nassau to New York cost almost as much. Ooops.

There is another outfit in Florida charged about $1000 for 6 days, fly you from Nassau to Exumas Sea Park and start from there going north. sailing on Klepper II folding Kayak with leeboards without outrigger.

Do You Yahoo!? Great stuff seeking new owners in Yahoo! Auctions!
