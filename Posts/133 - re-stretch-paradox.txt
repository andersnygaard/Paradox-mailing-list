Hello,

My name is Jeff Forrest and I am new to the Paradox builders page.  I have recently ordered plans, but have not received them quite yet.  I am also potentially interested in stretching Paradox by 10-15%.  When you refer to multiplying by the %factor are you speaking only of length measurements, or also width(beam) measurements?  In other words, can you simply lengthen the boat without changing beam measurement?  Any clarification would be greatly appreciated.

Jeff
