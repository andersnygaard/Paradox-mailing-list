Hi Pete,

Two pack gloss black (international perfection). The cost can only be described as insane and I had to psych myself up for the purchase... but... I managed to get two coats on Small Fry with some left over from just one litre which is all that is needed. The paint can be rolled and brushed and then it spreads out so that a short time after brushing the brush marks disappear. It looks better than any spray job I've seen. Also, being two pack I've found it to be very durable. It has withstood some serious abuse to date. 

Cheers,
Geoff.
