Subject: Re: Great Loop?

Many avoid the lower Mississippi and its tows by turning east, running 46 miles UP the Ohio, then the Cumberland, and down the Tennessee River and the Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway to Mobile Bay. This requires a motor, but I don't think that human power alone would get you up the Hudson to the Erie Canal, so human muscle power as an auxiliary is out, regardless. The only question is, can you make it 250 miles between fueling points?
