Subject: Scaling and modifying paradox.

Hi 

Just thinking on making paradox / small cruiser for my needs, coastal sailing with son. Was thinking of 5ft beam to give extra space in interior, length increase to 15ft6, to use most of materials hull depth would prescribed by the sides sprung out to 5ft, but 6in would be about right. Water ballast in form of 4 x 5 gal jugs. Cabin taken to sides of boat, front hatch for anchoring, 4ft bow section, 6ft long cabin, 4ft aft deck, external ply and paint and cotton finish. 

All of these would be within the spirit of paradox, but perhaps a little less paradox and more usable?! What do people think? 

Yours, 
James
