Subject: Re: Electronic device for race

Dear Paradox Sailboat team,

I hope this email finds you well. I am reaching out in response to your inquiry about electronic race devices. I have attached a GPX file that I exported from OpenCPN, which can be easily imported into the desktop version of Google Earth. Additionally, I have also included an Excel spreadsheet that I converted the GPX file to.

Please let me know if you have any further questions or if there is anything else I can assist you with.

Best regards,

[Your Name]
