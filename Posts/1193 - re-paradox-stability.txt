Al,

Do the chine runners provide sufficient lateral resistance in light wind speeds when the boat is not fully loaded? I assume you are not using water ballast in order to keep up with the Minisail, or are you? How much does the boat weigh in the configuration shown? I'm wondering how the boat works for just playing around by the beach, versus actually cruising anywhere.

Thanks,
Paul
