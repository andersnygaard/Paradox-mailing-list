Hello,


Over 2 years now since I first started thinking about this micro charcoal heater. Now, having almost completed a NON-PARADOX Gorfnik copy AND the weather is getting cold here, I want to add a tiny solid-fuel heater to my little boat.

I did a bunch of searching and found a post on the Phil Bolger's Boats group about a Lenihan Homemade charcoal cabin heater. This one sounds very similar to the one on Jim's Paradox. One thing that I noticed that I hadn't heard before (might have just missed it) was the grill or grate to hold the charcoal or bits of wood above the bottom door. I assume Jim's version has something like that also?

I also found Jimstimes blog with more information about his little heater in case anyone else missed it. Looks like that little heater gets used a lot judging from a quick scan of his blog. I bookmarked that site.



Thank you,

Brian
