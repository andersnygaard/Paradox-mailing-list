Agreed, that seems right, 57 I know if i work at it I could figure it out, but its much easier to follow where one has tread before. Thanks

On my plans I have pencilled in "57?" on the dimension arrows at the top right. I would have calculated this from the deck beam info on sheet 10. As I had no problem when I came to put the deck on I assume this 57mm is ok.

If in doubt leave cutting the top until the deck beam is attached.
