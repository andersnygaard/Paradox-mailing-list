Hi Alastair,

So the emergency buoyancy required to float the boat - and support my lithe person - (Oh how I wish) -  high enough to enable bailing out is something like 400/500 litres.

Is the emergency buoyancy given by your foam anything like that amount? Sounds improbable to me. Also remember that the foam itself weighs something which you need to subtract from the result.

I wonder what would be the effect of the free surface sloshing around if the boat part flooded. I can't think that it would help stability and recovery.

Is your foam the closed cell type?

Best,

Jim
