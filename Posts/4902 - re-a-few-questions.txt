I have the following queries.

1.
I've positioned the intermediate deck beam between Bulkheads 1&amp;2 but have found that the deck beam on Bkhd 1 is slightly low. I seem to recall seeing some photos of someone elses build with this beam built up slightly. Is this a common problem or have i measured something wrong?
Looks like I'll have to add a strip of 9mm ply or similar, the top of the stem also looks like it will need a few mm knocked off!

I think the low deck beam may be a common problem; I seem to remember adding a thin piece of ply, but all of the deck beams needed fairing.

I also had to build up the top of the stem slightly.

on the Cabin details sheet 10, there is an exploded view of the Corner Post detail. I have looked at this from every angle and can still not understand what it is trying to show. Is it a plan view or elevation?
What part of the post do the two angles refer too (30=BA &amp; 14=BA).

This photo may help you resolve the angle problem:

but to be strictly accurate I should have faired the top of the support posts instead of having the forward edges parallel.  However, I think that makes a stronger structure at the upper end - only aesthetically is it less pleasing.

What internal paint available in the UK do you recommend for internal finish? Porch paint and the like mean nothing to me! Would a good oil-based gloss paint be OK over sanded epoxy coating? I've also been wondering whether to apply non-slip to the cabin sole. I think it would be a good idea, in that it would provide a better footing, however, as I like to wear shorts, it probably wouldn't be too kind on my knees.

Internal paint need only be good quality household type, but I went the whole hog and used best marine paint (International).  I used deck paint on the cabin sole to prevent me slipping. As you say, it could be a bit rough on the knees.  In that respect, I have two thin waterproof seat cushions which I use for kneeling on.

Other than that things are progressing steadily.
Regards
Bill.
