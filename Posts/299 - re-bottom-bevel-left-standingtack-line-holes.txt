Subject: Re: Bottom Bevel Left Standing/tack line holes

I coat every hole I drill with at least two coats of epoxy and usually three. If the hole is in plywood I will treat as follows. After coating the first time with straight epoxy and allowing the end grain to soak up all it can, I mix up a thickened batch with cabasill and coat the edge. This will act as an armor coating.
