Hi David,

I don't have a problem, Norton refused to pass the email, quarentined
it instead. My old version of Norton AV didn't do email, Norton AV
2002 does. I received 3 infected emails that day from this group.

   Hi Les,

   That must have been what hit me too. Norton defines it as: WScript.KakWorm.dr virus.
