Hi Roselt

Good luck with your Paradox build and I bet that you're looking forward to getting her finished and in the water.

Thanks for the info re Small Fry. I'm looking forward to Geoff giving us a report first hand as it would help us all to gain more knowledge about the limits to the Paradox's seaworthiness.

Interesting that you compare the Paradox to the old Vertue as they're very dissimilar in design apart from the disparity in size. 

I bought my Paradox from the original builder - Bill Serjeant, 7 years ago - and it's certainly turned out to be one of my better decisions. I've had loads of cruising in her and enjoyed it all. I'm convinced that it's the best boat for me. But I'm too sissy to go out in storm conditions to find out the limits for myself.

Best
Jim
