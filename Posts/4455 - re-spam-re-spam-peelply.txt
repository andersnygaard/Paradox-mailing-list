No Perry, it was pretty much elbow grease I used on Zoe, the final finish was put on with a roller and foam brush using Awlgrip. I believe I have already discussed how to get a good finish some were in the archives or files section. If not I will do a short piece on how it's done, not really difficult at all.

Glen,

Did you use peelply to get your excellent finish on Zoe? This is a new concept to me. I would love for you to give us a primer on how this works.
