David, 

I have address for the bronze and pipe, but don't have time to dig them up right now. I will get back to you on Monday when I return. Don't use nylon as I'm pretty sure it will elongate under stress. There is a plastic called UHMW (Ultra High Molecular Weight) which will work fine. Sounds like you are on track with the anti-freeze.

Tailwinds,
Glen
