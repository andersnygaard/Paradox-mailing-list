Hi James,

I know little about boat design except that you had better know what you are doing or you will end up with a pig.

However, if you are increasing the length/beam of teh hull I would expect it to require more ballast. As designed Paradox has 7okg (150lb) of water ballast and 70 to 180kg (150 - 400lb) of lead. I feel your 20lb of water ( less if you are measuring in US gallons) may result in a rather unstable boat.
