Subject: Re: polyester?

Thanks for the interesting replies to my polyester question! Yes, I'm trying to keep my Paradoxproject on a tight budget. I live in the middle of Sweden, 2 hrs by car to the nearest coast, so I believe my vessel will stay on land most of the time. Her trailerability is of fundamental interest to me. The ply I use is not marine but exterior grade. (So is almost all ply nowadays I'm told) It has rather soft surfaces, so I intend to fiberglass all outer surfaces. As for the polyester I reflect on, it's advertised as "extremely adhesive". I believe that means it's sticky enough on bare wood. I don't know much about chemistry so I think I have better study some literature before I decide.
