Paradox is a momocoque design (like many instant boats) not a sharpie which is built of plywood over frame with keelson. If you build over 20% above the design you can end up with a boat having inadequate internal bracing on top of all the other inherited problems that come up. You would have to fashion some kind of ribs after the fact or install more bulkheads and figure out how that affects internal space and so on. Paul fisher (selway-fisher.com) accomplishes it with what he calls eggbox designhttp://www.selway-fisher.com/BSwan22p1.jpg

There are many great sharpie designs if someone wants a boat bigger than 18 feet. My last sharpie was a 'stretched' version of the 21ft Fancyfree. http://www.glen-l.com/designs/sailboat/fancyfree.html
NOTE this boat is ply over frame and the boat was stretched against Glen-L recommendations of not more than 10%. The experienced builder actually inserted additional stations and moved the centerboard trunk to the new center of gravity and increased the size and weight of it to compensate for the added buoyancy. He refaired the lines and the beam and everything else was kept the same.

Since then Glen-L offers plans for a 27 foot ketch called Chessie Flyer which I recommend instead of stretching the previous design as my boat's builder did.

One problem encountered with larger sharpies is the lack of headroom because cabin height has to be kept low for stability usually around 4 feet. In my boat one scooted from place to place in the boat on their bottom and even the galley was constructed to cook while seated. I could stand in the open hatchway to cook in hot weather. I had lots of lateral space and my stretched 26 feet allowed a full head and closet not shown on the Glen-L web page with plenty of stowage and comfortable sleeping for four people..

Larger sharpies are often not self righting past 50 degrees of heel and not self rescuing.because the swing keel of around 400+lbs does not provide enough weight to right them. The mast is kept short and they are usually gaff or sprit rigged. This is not an issue with a small boat like Paradox whose mass and displacement is much less and the water ballast can handle it. Michalak uses iron re-bar rods bolted under the floor or on the bottom of bulkheads for ballast and still retaining the beaching aspect of a sharpie. 


By the way... Michalak on Duckworks has the least expensive plans out there averaging around $30 http://duckworksbbs.com/plans/jim/michalak.htm
