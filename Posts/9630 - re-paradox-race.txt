My messages on here will be drying up for a while but get in touch with me if y'all need anything.

If it would help to show I am serious about a race I can send a portion of the prize money to one of the more well-known people in the group to hold, so there will be no question about this being legit.

One other thing, I think it is showing me as an owner on this group. If I am listed as an owner can the ownership be given back to Glen Maxwell so either he can take his group back or he can pick someone.
