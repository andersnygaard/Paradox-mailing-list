Thomas. You cannot be very dedicated to building a PARADOX if the antics of a couple of members can put you off.

It's like arguing over how many Angels can dance on the head of a pin and storming out of a sowing circle.

Anyhow, what's wrong with being a saddo. Some of the greatest men in the world were or are saddo's.

We have one visiting the UK tomorrow.

Saddo Jeff UK

PS. When I said great I included men of power that are not necessarily great.

Hello All,

I just wanted to say that all the mindless nonsense that goes on between certain members of the group has totally put me off buying the plans and constructing a Paradox boat of my own. I don't want to end up like some of you saddo's out there

Bye,

Thomas.
