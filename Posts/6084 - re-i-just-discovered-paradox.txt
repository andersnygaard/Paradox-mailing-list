Subject: Re: I just discovered Paradox

Hi Cathy,

Welcome to the group. I have been a follower of Matt's designs for about 5 years now. I purchased the plans for Paradox several years ago. The plans are excellent and very detailed. I have no doubt that anyone who carefully follows Matt's plans can build a Paradox.

I haven't done any fiberglass and epoxy work before, so that will be the scary part for me. This group has a lot of information and helpful members, (as you have already seen.)

You may also want to consider Matt's Enigma 460 cruiser. It is a lighter, stitch and glue construction coastal cruiser, approximately the same size as Paradox. It should be a faster and easier build than Paradox. George Van Sickle is building the prototype version of Enigma and already has spent some time sailing it. Matt has indicated that he will offer plans for Enigma 460, once the prototype is proven out. You can read about George building his boat on his blog: http://e460.blogspot.com/

I plan to build the Enigma 460 once the plans are available. I have collected information on the Enigma at this webpage:

I have made a webpage showing the advantages of Matt's cruisers here:

All the best,
Dave
