Dear Friends,

Actually I'm not able to send private messages, I believe it is a problem with my ISP. But on today's date, send correspondence via the postal service. Also provided sending the amount of $40.00 for payment of the plants. I hope everything goes well and soon I start up my building.

To everyone who sent me messages and did not receive private replies I appreciate the willingness to help.

A great week everyone!

Regards,
Fernando
