No! No! NO!

Sorry for the agitated response, but you'r messing with the size of a pint of BEER!

the _US_ pint (473 ml or 16 US fluid ounces) is substandard and always leaves you hankering after that last swig, being about 17% smaller than the UK pint (568 ml or 20 UK fluid ounces), from  _http://cgi.peak.org/~jeremy/retort.cgi?American=pint_ 

The US oz (29.6 ml) is a bit bigger than the imperial oz. (28.4 ml), which explains the math(s).

Sometimes you get the best of both worlds. Here in Portland OR, it is traditional for the craft breweries (33 of them) to serve their wares in an imperial pint glass called a "pounder" which curously, holds more than a pound.
