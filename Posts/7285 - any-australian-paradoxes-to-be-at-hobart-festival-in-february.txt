Subject: Any Australian Paradoxes to be at Hobart festival in February?

There is still space in the 'Boats Ashore' category at the Australian Wooden Boat Festival in Hobart in February. That is for vessels which can be displayed on a trailer or cradle.

Who is going to bring their Paradox to show off?  :-D

Registration closes on December 17th.
