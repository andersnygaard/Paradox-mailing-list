I think I will buy the plans and then bite the bullet when I am financial. A very appealing boat, regardless of its abilities. I found a website with paradox on it in the Bahamas, not a great deal of text though. Is there an existing website that offers more info? Alternatively, how does it sail? How does it handle a knockdown, etc.? Don't get me wrong, you guys here have discussed construction (which I have gleaned some good info from) but I haven't found a great deal on the boat's ability. I read somewhere that Matt endorsed it as a coastal cruiser only, damned if I can remember where.
