Just got back from a couple of days on Poole Harbour. Weather hot and sunny.

Nice, does it fit inside ok? Or are you not storing it inside?

Just in case it should snap off at any time I can report that it is possible to scull 3.25 nM without any immediate suffering (No wind this morning, and I had to be home for lunch!)

Hoping for calm nights
