Subject: Re: WATER TANKS

Hi,

I posed this question months ago, You can get potable water safe epoxy, its expensive and who knows if in the long term its safe. I use the water tanks as ballast and really do not use it for cooking, drinking etc, if I wanted to rinse gear or wash clothes ect ect, I would use it and replenish with sea water and flush refill when on land, drinking water is stored in collapsible containers and coolers. If I were to go out for extended periods I would go for containers and a manual water filtration unit for emergency water. Not to mention sealing the tanks correctly is a Pain!
