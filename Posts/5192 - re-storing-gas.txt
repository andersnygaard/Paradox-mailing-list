Such a great angle! I would not have guessed. I did some yuloh 
searching with google today. I saw one design that had a range of several holes for the pin. It was Chinese I think. I wonder if there is an advantage in this, for head winds, tail winds or shallows? It would be so nice to avoid the engine entirely. The most pleasant weather here always seems to have the lightist little winds.
Thanks, Steve
