Subject: Enlarging.

Hello,

I am considering enlarging my Paradox to accommodate two people and a dog. I was wondering what the size increase would be if I increased it by 25%. The goal is to achieve more deck space for us to enjoy.

I really like this boat and I'm not quite interested in getting a bigger boat altogether unless someone advises me otherwise.

Thank you,

LEON
