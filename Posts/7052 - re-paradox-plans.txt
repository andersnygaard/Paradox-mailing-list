Hello!

I have just received the email from David.

Do not know much about the internet.

My problem is I cannot send individual emails to the U.S. All returned with error messages. I can for other countries: Argentina, France, England ... but for the U.S. to return the error message.

Many thanks to all friends who in one way or another offered me his help to get in touch with David! It's fantastic! I get my own Paradox.

My region has many lakes and waterways for hydropower.

Look on google earth by:
Chavantes - São Paulo - Brazil
Barra Bonita - Sao Paulo - Brazil
Avare - Sao Paulo Brazil

You will see that wonderful region we have here.

Thank you!
I wish you all a beautiful and happy holidays, God bless you all.
