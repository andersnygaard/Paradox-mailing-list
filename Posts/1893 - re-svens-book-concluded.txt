Subject: Re: Sven's book, concluded

It seems like a sensible suggestion that you (or anyone else out there who has connections) show the chapter to your editor, who, if interested, gives a concrete proposal for Sven to decide on. If the only alternative to get the book published in english is "ours", then perhaps Sven changes his mind. But he does have strong feelings about language quality...
