Subject: Re: Sail position


Hi Paul,

It would not equalize pointing ability (sail shape is different on each tack). I beleive, one of the reasons the sail is furled to the port side sidedeck, is that the yuloh position like this is better for right handed people. Think that over, if you want to have the sail centered, you maybe want to make the inside of the boat (and mast position) in mirror image?

Regards,

Eerik
