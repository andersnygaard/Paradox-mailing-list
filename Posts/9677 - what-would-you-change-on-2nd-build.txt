Subject: What would you change on 2nd build?

Hey all,

I'm 1/4 way into my build and it is clear there's hundreds of little things that can be done multiple ways in this boat. If you were to build second paradox, what would you do differently and why?

I'll start: I would spend more time looking for good lumber. I made some decisions too quick and bought some knotty and expensive spruce. I paid more than i would have for premium pine and had to resaw it, make lots of scarfs, and spend a few days designing round birdsmouth with taper in both diameter and wall thickness to console myself with the fact that it's will be lighter and stronger than the original and somehow worth it, then lots more time making it. It was weeks, but lesson learned I guess and I secretly always wanted to make a birdsmouth mast. But yeah, not worth it.

Hope your stories will help someone (me :D) who's building right now.
