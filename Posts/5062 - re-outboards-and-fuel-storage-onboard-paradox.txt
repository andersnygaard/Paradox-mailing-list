That's an appealing idea, but I'm not sure how a laptop would replace
the nav lights.

And I love my zillion candlepower searchlight.  Many's the time I've
used it to find buoys and markers in the dead of night.  And it can't
be beat for burning the eyes out of the heads of careless towboat pilots.

Nels, CDs and DVDs may be obsolete, but I just don't enjoy watching
movies on a screen as small as an Ipod's.  In a compressed format like
AVI, I can get an average of 10 to 12 hours of video entertainment on
a single DVD, and one DVD can hold literally days of music in MP3
form.  Some of the portable DVD players can play MP3s too, and the
screen is big enough to be watchable.

Al's advice to just run everything on dry cells is probably the most
sensible idea, for a boat as sensitive to weight as mine... but I
really do love my searchlight.  Plus, I already own a nice set of 12
volt running lights.  I suppose I could cobble up a couple 6 volt
flashlight batteries to run them.  I have an ancient Icom handheld VHf
.  Its battery pack has long since died, but it still works fine if
plugged into 12 volt.

It would probably be easier if I were buying new everything, but as a
longtime sailor/packrat, I'm trying to use as much of the functional
junk I've accumulated as possible.
