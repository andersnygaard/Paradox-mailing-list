Sharpies are not always enlarged proportionally.
My 21 foot Fancy Free design was stretched 5 feet with the same beam. It sailed far better. Bolger favored the 4/1 dimensions tho many boats give 3/1 or even less to try and make interior space. The Nordic Folkboat was about 4/1 and inside there was not room to swing a cat.
Sharpies are made to sail on a heel and the hard chine forms the vee to keep things tracking. This is how a chine runner works to extend that chine downward when the boat is heeled.
I would be more concerned about stretching a design by the widening of the spaces between bulkheads as these are also the stations on a Paradox. Glen-L does not recommend doing that more than 10%. My boat was lengthened by the builder adding more stations into the center of the design and re-fairing the hull.
Stretching will give more buoyancy which must be compensated for in ballast. Center of buoyancy will move aft and center of gravity will move upward. Glen-L has some interesting comments about enlarging their designs in the helps section of their web page.

Yes--I quoted from this file in my original post. But that enlargement is in ALL dimensions, yielding a huge displacement and putting the bigger boat in a different tow category at the very least, all for the sake of a little more living space, and a mite bit higher hull speed.
