I searched the message archives for opinions on scaling Paradox to fit two comfortably (or at least one tall guy like myself), but I did not find any definitive answers. So: Will scaling the Paradox (indefinitely) change the way the boat performs in a negative way? If one takes into account all factors, such as scaling up the ballast, sailplan, etc. could you make this an 18-20 foot boat safely?

I believe that the conclusion reached when this was discussed last was that the length could safely be extended up to 10 percent, keeping other dimensions the same

Pardon my ignorance, but I'm not an engineer or a naval architect, so my knowledge of these dark arts is nil. 

One other question: To add stability and self-righting capability (at the expense of super-shallow water sailing), could you add a ballast keel or bilge keels without totally destroying the boat's theoretical performance? Is the boat self-righting if built to plan?

I received a graph, either with the plans or with Dons articles, which shows that a correctly ballasted Paradox will self right from 165 degrees. That is there are only 15 degrees where it is stable upside down. This is something I shall be taking on trust and will not be (intentionally) testing for real.
