Subject: Mk2 sail

Im wondering if the problem most have had with the mk2 sail being that it creases, I feel that this could be that luff tape was not used, as this would shrink the luff when in low winds and that would stretch as the sail fills. Matt mentions the luff tape in the new sail plan. I also would like to know from anybody that has had a professional sail loft build the sail if they used luff tape or not. if so what size?

thanks
Jack
