Subject: Re: Bolger Box and Dory Hull Comparison

Since posting that, I have come across some more information that may 
be of interest. It seems quite likely that the chine runners apply a 
lot of their effectiveness only when the boat is moving through the 
water. The water, as it meets the resistance from the slab-sided hull 
which is heeled somewat is forced downward under the hull, but when 
it hits the runner it is deflected towards that stern and this 
actually adds some push to the boat. So some the resistance force 
adds to the forward motion. Therefore the faster the boat moves 
through the water the less leeway it will experience. Of course this 
also applies to standard keels as well except a standard keel being 
more underneath the hull isn't exposed to the downward force of the 
water as much.

Another advantage that may not be as obvious is what happens if one 
is caught off a lee shore and lying ahull or reefed right down. 
Paradow will be less likely to get knocked down because, with no keel 
hanging below she can slide sideways instead. Also if Paradox gets 
washed up over a reef there is less chance of hitting it and actually 
can get washed up right onto shore with little damage unless it is 
really treacherous with rocks. In fact one could quite feasibly just 
hunker down inside and wait until the waves carry you high enough 
that you can walk away, where a deeper draft boat would be still 
getting bashes apart farther offshore.

This is where shallow draft can be a life saver. Which of course is 
why life boats are shallow draft:-)
