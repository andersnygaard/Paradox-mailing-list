Hi DC,

The tack pipe rides in a copper pipe flared and fitted in the deck as a line fare lead. To date I have seen no deck damage of any kind from it. I would suggest making it about 1 1/2" to long so that you can make sure the boom does not hit the top corner of the cabin as it swings up from the stowage area. I wound up making another because my cabin was a little higher I guess. After ensuring clearance you can reduce the length. 

As for the topping lift, I talked to Matt this week end at the Cedar Key Messabout (we all had a great time) and he mentioned his trick was to put pressure on the furling line with his foot while hoisting and pressure on the halyard with his foot while furling. This allowed him to use both hands for raising or furling. You might want to try that first as it avoids the extra line. I have seen him furl his sail and he really makes it look easy, worth a try.
