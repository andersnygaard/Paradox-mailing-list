Sorry, I meant to say "LESS prone to damage or being holed".  I'm in favor of steel as a building material.

I think you'd gain the advantages of simpler and faster construction, and a hull that would be damaged on beaching or holed by surprise impacts (other than icebergs or Exocet missiles.)
Meaning it would be more prone to damage Bill?? 

I have another idea on top of the steel.... I have a roll of 12 oz biax without mat backing, I could biax the steel skinned hull? does fabric work with a steel base the same or better than it does with plywood??

I would think 3/16 would be a too thick, perhaps 12 gauge (.10").  Remember, if you go with steel you should add some longitudinal stringers and a few more frames.  You are correct in that you could very much open up the mast bulkhead.  You would have to use steel tubing, but that would probably be a good idea for all bulkheads (1"x1") with stringers would likely be okay, I would suspect. Make your gunnel out of 3/4 square tube and attach a wood deck to it. Radar reflectivity?  I don't think there would be much difference because you are so low in the water.  I think you'd gain the advantages of simpler and faster construction, and a hull that would be damaged on beaching or holed by surprise impacts (other than icebergs or Exocet missiles.)
