Be sure you check with Bolger before starting your build. He has made some upgrades since the original plans that Dynamite Payson sells. That design is fairly complicated to build compared to his newer designs and the cabin space is pretty low. Also it has a tall heavymast that is not easy to step.

He has another design called Martha Jane that supercedes it. It is far more practical, trailer friendly and roomy, but not as nice to look at. Has tabernakled masts, and water ballest.

Someone said, "When I am sailing in my boat, I don't give a damn if others don't like how it looks. That's their problem. I love the view from where I'm sitting."

Those plans have been upgraded too, to include a pilothouse with standing headroom down the central slot and sponsons either side of the cockpit to make it self righting from a 90+ degree knockdown and improved leeboard design.

A Robbsboat would get you out on the water sooner though:-)
