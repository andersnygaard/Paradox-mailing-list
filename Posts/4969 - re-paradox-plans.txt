Hi All (Incl Al &amp; Greg)

My Paradox plans showed up very quickly and they did have a fair way to go. A couple of weeks at the most.

Enjoy

They said, get a life. I looked on TradeMe but I couldn't find one.

Hello Al,

just as an idea . . . . from ordering to getting your sticky mitts 
on the plans . . . .

How long did it take to get them?

Greg

I really don't remember, but not more than a couple of weeks, I am 
sure.

If Dave isn't answering emails he is, almost certainly, away 
somewhere.

Hoping for calm nights
