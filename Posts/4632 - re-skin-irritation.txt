Ian,
I'm sure it's likely to be an individual thing, but I've had no problems with MAS epoxy which I've been using for my build (touch wwod).

Sometimes I wear a mask other times not. If I'm working with a good breeze blowing through the shop i don't bother. Other times if I'm couped up in my shed and notice the smell I put the mask on.

I hope you find a solution to the problem. Are you sure it's the epoxy? You're not allergic to latex gloves are you?

Good luck with the building and keep us posted on how you're getting on.
Today I installed the sheer strakes on JoHanna and will be turning her over in the next couple of days to start work on the bottom. Details as usual here:
