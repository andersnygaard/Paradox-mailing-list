Great advice from Nick Bell, completely agree. It’s crazy how just doing one tiny thing every day keeps the momentum going

Ok , now you’ve started here’s a little hint about process

Sometimes projects stall and nothing gets done

The remedy to this human habit is to do at least one thing physically to your project each day no matter what

No matter how quick or seemingly insignificant, do one thing every day

The effect on motivation is fantastic and drives thing forward

Nick those beams are beautiful. I like the 2 tone and will now build mine like that,

Today I picked up a beautiful piece of Mahogany 1” x 10” x 9’   the color is consistent and grain is about as straight as possible and i paid for it $$$

I also picked up 2 of the same size board(s) in White Oak 1 for beam laminates an 1 for bulkhead cleats and a 1- 9mm Loyds Certified Okoume Ply more $$$. If the Oak doesn’t work (bend) I’ll use the Okoume with Mahogany to laminate beams.

* side note! In Devons Plywood boat building book it mentions White Oak as a good wood for boat building but in Paradox plans Matt says to avoid Oak. Maybe he’s referring to Red Oak which is oily (not good for gluing)?

Out of the blue, A old friend called today who happens to be passionate about woodworking, with a well equipped shop. Sunday I will make my first official cuts when the beam laminates are ripped with his table saw! It’s only taken me 9 years to get to this point!!!!
