From the province of Chubut in the Argentinean Patagonia, we want to give you a warm welcome to this wonderful experience of receiving hundreds of whales through the coast of Chubut. Thanks to new technologies, you can now watch live how these giants of the sea come to our shores to rest, mate and feed for several months.
