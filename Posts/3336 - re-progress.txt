Hi

I tried again. The link isn't greyed, it allows me to select the album and choose the photo but when I click 'add' instead of loading the photo it tells me that I don't have privileges. I used to be underprivileged but I've never been without privileges before! This is getting like work - aggravation :0) BTW I got attacked by a 9 year old at work this work. It's never happened to me before; weird feeling afterwards.
