It seems Yahoo! is once again trying to spam its users without consent. 
They did some server rework last week, and the news is out that they have set *every* account to receive spam and to give out your email and phone number to marketing groups. This is bad! VERY BAD! :(

Instructions to get yourself *out* of their latest scam:

Go to the Yahoogroups page: http://www.groups.yahoo.com. 
After you log in click on Account Info on the top right corner of the screen. 
Enter your password when prompted, then below the listing of your email addresses, 
you'll see a link for "Edit Marketing Preferences", click on that.  
You'll see it's set to Yes (please send me spam) on every option.  
Set them all to No, don't forget the two towards the bottom of the page about phone and snail mail spam and click the button to save it.
