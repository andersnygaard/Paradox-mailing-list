Subject: Re: Paradox tacking difficulties

Hi,

I have understood here that tacking is difficult mostly when heavily reefed. Can it be that it is caused by CE moving forward as the head of the sail is shorter than foot? That would cause (more) lee helm and would make tacking more difficult?

Regards,
Eerik
