There are several peculiarities about the Paradox. They are not too obvious at first. The very first in my opinion is the size. It is quite small looking from the outside. Everyone comments on it when I'm out with it. Hand in hand with that is that it is very big and roomy on the inside. In addition to the size is the wonderful interconnectedness of the sail rig to the hull, cabin, chinerunners, rudder, the roller reefing and the control lines. It would, in my opinion, be a big mistake to change any of these. If you study the design patiently this will come into view. The saving of some money would be more expensive in a way. Your mast might be usable though.
