I made mine as drawn, and I have no worries about damage, It's 
built like a tank. Anything that will do serious damage to the chines 
is going to create much bigger problems than a bit of wet ply.

I think Matts' thinking was not "let's make it so that damaged bits 
can be easily repaired" but more like "let's make it strong so it 
won't get damaged".

Looking at the chine runners, and this would be my next step after bottom goes on. Would it be better to finish the hull and glass it to seal it, then apply the chine runners to the sealed hull, like sacrificial rub rails, so that if by chance they get damaged that the hull bottom is separate and will not allow water to wick into the hull bottom they could be epoxied on, then a light FG taping?
