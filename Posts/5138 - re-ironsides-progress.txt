I thought I would do all the fiberglassing before I do the cabin. 
That way there is no delicat structure bearing the weight. I intend 
to use some old tires under the boat, as a cushion, when I roll it 
over. I've done this on another boat and it works nicly. 

That's what I did, it was easy. 

I also glassed the deck before fitting the cabin. That way the edge 
of the glass is under the cabin structure, not butting up to it. I 
felt that was a neater way to do it. It was also much easier as I 
just stretched a sheet of glass cloth over the whole deck and cut out 
the holes after the epoxy started to cure.
