Hi Jack

No need to go away at all. You originally started this thread looking for feedback. Just because you didn't like some of it is no need to go away.

Back yards all over the world are filled with unfinished boats because the builder thought he had a better idea than the person who drew up the original plans.

If you really feel you have a better idea then don't let a few doubting Thomas's stop you.

Go for it - just make sure you have all the information you can get. You will end up with a different boat than Paradox and can then sell your own plans!

I got shot down too, when I suggested a "motorsailer" version of Paradox. (I'm still secretly working on it - but don't tell Al:-)

Cheers, Nels
