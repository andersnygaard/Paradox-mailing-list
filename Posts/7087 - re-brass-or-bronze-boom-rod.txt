Bronze or stainless (what I used) would be best. As Jack said easily 
bent is not a good idea. Drill a hole in a tree, stick your bar into 
it, slide a scaffold pipe (or similar) over the end sticking out and 
lean on it. Someone beating hell out of it with a lump hammer, at the 
same time, probably won't do any harm. I wedged in a log to bend 
round so as to get a nice radius to the curve.

I don't think the retaining groove is strictly necessary. I put one 
in mine but no longer bother to tighten the screw. It has never 
showed any tendency to come out.
