Sheetrock screws work well as temporary clamps, until the epoxy sets. Driving them first through a piece of scrap plywood effectively enlarges the surface area of the head, for better holding power and eliminates marring the surface. Once removed just fill the holes with some of that leftover glue the nest time you do a glue-up.

Rod,

To be honest, I doubt that it matters whether you nail them or not.
I nailed at the bulkheads, but used screws at the intermediate beams as there would be too much spring back to countersink the nails. i've no idea what size nails I used - short enough not to go all the way through the beams!
You can actually see some nail heads here:

I know that Glen did not use any mechanical fasteners at all on Zoe, and I doubt whether they actually do anything other than possibly promote rot!

I fitted all my deck panels with screws, prior to bonding, to make sure everything fitted correctly. It takes a fair bit of pressure to get the camber fwd of bulkhead 1, in fact I scored the inner ply to allow in to bend a bit easier.

Looking forward to seeing some pictures, I've been working on my spars over the last couple of weeks....
