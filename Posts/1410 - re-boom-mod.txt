Subject: Re: boom mod?

Hi Kjell,

I'm not a sailmaker but what you suggest might in theory be a solution to completely rolling up the new sail.

You are suggesting a slightly tapered boom it seems right?

Trouble is how much larger the aft diameter, so that it would roll up just right!

From what Matt says it is not a big problem because the sail is already pretty much full rolled up by the time there is some left over due to the peaked gaff.

I wonder if anyone has a phot of his new sail?
