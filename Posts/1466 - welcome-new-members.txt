Hello new members,

I notice there have been about a dozen new members sign up in the last couple of weeks.

I would like to welcome you to join in the dialogue with the group and post any questions, comments or suggestions that you have.

Also, browse through the photos and files and notice that some are a work in progress.

We are also in the progress of considering developing plans for a somewhat enlarged version of Paradox and would like feedback of any kind.

In the Links section, there are several other places listed that contain information on Paradox and other related designs, as well as where to purchase plans.

Cheers,
Nels
