Thankyou for sharing

Interesting to hear the noises too
I am noise sensitive and had a real bad time becoming accustomed to the gurgling noises made by small ripples.

Slept at anchor twice
One in a tidal creek full of bugs, do NOT turn on any light and it’s ok, the tide wash was awful and unsleepable, between the tide rise/fall was ok
Once nearshore on a perfectly calm night was great, had a full deep sleep.

More sailing in two months for me
