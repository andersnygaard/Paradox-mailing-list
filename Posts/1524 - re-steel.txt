I would think 3/16 would be a too thick, perhaps 12 gauge (.10"). Remember, if you go with steel you should add some longitudinal stringers and a few more frames. You are correct in that you could very much open up the mast bulkhead. You would have to use steel tubing, but that would probably be a good idea for all bulkheads (1"x1") with stringers would likely be okay I would suspect. Make your gunnel out of 3/4 square tube and attach a wood deck to it. Radar reflectivity? I don't think there would be much difference because you are so low in the water. I think you'd gain the advantages of simpler and faster construction, and a hull that would be damaged on beaching or holed by surprise impacts (other than icebergs or Exocet missiles.)
