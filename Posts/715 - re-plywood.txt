Hi Paul,

I prefer to store my water in small containers, the tanks make great storage areas  also. I  have permanent ballast there and don't have use the water as ballast. I have glassed the outside to stop the checking, But there are way to many small pieces to glass on the interior I  believe it would be cheaper to change plywood.
