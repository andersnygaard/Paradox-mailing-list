What I would do is hope that Al and Jack and Glen can offer their real life expertise. IIRC I believe most guys launch with an empty hull. Load her up with all their gear and then balance it level to the LWL with the lead. Then mount it permanently before you do any serious sailing.

Most guys seem to start off with things on the light side for ballest which gives one a good idea of the perfoamance ability of the chine runners as you later get it down to it's lines.

I think Don Elliot has a whole bunch of articles about this at his site. All in agonizing mind numbing detailed details.

Ooops did I just say that?
