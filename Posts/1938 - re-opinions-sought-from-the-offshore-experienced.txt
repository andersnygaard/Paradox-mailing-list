Subject: Re: Opinions sought from the offshore experienced

If one considered using Paradox as an offshore microcruiser, would any
of the following items add value to its already extensive list of safety
features? I've noticed that many sailors consider them essential to offshore sailing.

-A sprayhood
-A leecloth system (I'm imagining a few seatbelts securely connected to the floorboards -- some for seated positions, some for sleep.)
-A small windvane. Is it even possible to fit one to Paradox?
-A spare rudder (compact, stowable emergency rudder)
-A foam filled mast
-Toerails and handholds, in case you have crawl around on deck at sea.
-Smaller lexan windows or backing supports for the windows, to lessen the chance of storm waves bashing them in.

Would these features tip the scales in favor of sailing offshore in Paradox?

Paradox was designed as a minimal coastal and estuary cruiser for one person, but as I've stated before, in the right hands she could cross an ocean. However, I'm of the opinion that far more suitable yachts could be found for such an enterpise.
