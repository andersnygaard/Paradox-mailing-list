Subject: Yet Another Paradox Article

For those of you lucky enough to have a subscription to SMALL CRAFT ADVISOR, there is a nice article by Ron Hoddinott called the "Cedar Key Small Boat Meet" which dedicates quite a lot of copy space to talk about the two Paradox boats that he saw there. These boats of course were Glenn Maxwell's Zoe and David Beard's Whisper. Ron speaks very highly of these little fourteen footers, and at one point even comments, "Zoe appeared to be sailing to windward higher and faster than my Sea Pearl with it's leeboard down!" In addition to listing many of Paradox' unique characteristics, he also mentions seeing Matt Layden, "the reclusive designer," at the get together. To go along with the story there are four nice pictures of Zoe and Whisper as well as many other fine photographs of other boats that were at the meet. 

In addition to this article, there are several other nice ones in this Sept/Oct 2003 issue including one by Hugh Horton about the great "Two Continent Canoe Expedition" by Valerie and Verlen Kruger. In the beginning of this episode (part II), the Krueger's are struggling to cross the Gulf Stream to get to the Bahamas from Florida. I've just started reading and it looks so good that I think I'll have to leave you guys for now... Dave...
