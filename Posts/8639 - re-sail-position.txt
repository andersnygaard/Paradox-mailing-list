Hello Rob

The concave luff was my sailmaker's suggestion and has worked out well. He knows a thing or two about lug rig and junk rig.

Your choice of sailmaker is critical. Nearly all their work involves those pointy head Bermudan sails.and that's what they're competent doing and used to. There are computer programs that work out the ideal amount of broad seam for Bm sails and are used by most sailmakers with good results..

But the computer cutting programs don't work so well with rectangular sails, so an old school sail making chap who knows how to calculate broad seeming is better for us...

Someone was talking about modification to the rig on this channel a few days ago.

An idea that has occurred to me is to raise the height of the mast  - perhaps a metre or so, and reduce the length of the boom a corresponding amount so that the sail has a higher aspect ratio while keeping the same sail area.

I would think that windward performance would be improved and slow tacking addressed due to the centre of effort being moved forward. Downside, it would be impossible to stow the mast inside the boat while trailing - which might be a major snag for some users and there would be a greater healing moment.

What it needs is an energetic wealthy man to build both types of mast, sail and boom so he could do a side by side test and report back to us with his findings.....or insults if appropriate. 

Best
Jim
