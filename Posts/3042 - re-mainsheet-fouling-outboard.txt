Yes, its the short shaft. It works great, when the motor is fully lowered,
the lowest point of the motor is still above the lowest point of the hull,
you don't have to worry about hitting submersed objects. The hull will hit
before the motor.

P.S. I have a long shaft Yamaha also, I have tried them both and prefer the
short shaft.
