Hi Pete.

If I am not careful you will be afloat before me :-)

Looking at your dry assembly, I don't see why you could not build her stitch and glue with two layers making up the bottom panel or even just one thickness of 1/2".

My way of thinking in giving NOLI only a 3/8" thick bottom was that the original wooden West Wight Potter had an even wider bottom and yet only had a hull thickness of 5/16" and these boats were designed to do the same things as PARADOX.

Just a thought.
