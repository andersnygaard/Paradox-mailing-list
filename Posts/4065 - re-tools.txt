Pete,

To date I have not used a table saw or a bandsaw, but they would have been useful.  I've simply used an ordinary rip saw, then planed and sanded the sawn wood by hand.  I do not own a Skilsaw, but the tool I've found most useful for shaping plywood is an electrical hand-held jigsaw; all of my plywood has been shaped with this tool.  My mast, boom and yuloh were all cut and formed with a rip saw.

Good tools make the job easier and quicker, but it's surprising how few tools are actually necessary to build Paradox.  There's one tool you can't get by without, and that's a clamp, in fact I ended up with more than 30 of them for clamping the sheer strakes and the chine logs.  I fitted the chine logs as shown on the plan using the full dimensions without laminating them, but I needed all my strength and two 5ft bar clamps to complete the task.  Doing this job in hot sunshine helped to may the wood more subtle and me to sweat profusely.

On my web site:

http://www.paradox-uk.co.uk

there is a list of tools at this page:

http://www.smallsailboats.co.uk/paradox/building.htm#tools

 which I more or less cribbed from Don Elliot's builder's manual, but in hindsight, several of the tools listed are not needed.   In light of my experience, I'll have to amend my list

Best wishes,

Bill.
