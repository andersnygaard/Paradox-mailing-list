Hey Jack,

If you build it from steel - you won't need folding wheels, just 
drive it along the bottom. In which case the persicope mast will be 
very functional:-)

Happy New Year,

Nels

I agree, 

pricing out and new state of the art underwater navigation 
technology called "whitestick sonar"  that would make this all 
possible. ofcourse fitted with the latest onstarfish system in case 
of the seaside emergency, like locking yourself out while doing a 
reef dive.

Happy New Year!

Jack
