Subject: Video - Scout Northbound - Downwind all the way

Towed Scout to Cattail Cove (about 7 miles south of town, even though I say north on the video) on Friday to take advantage of a Southerly breeze....sailed her all the way home...then bummed a ride down south to pick up the truck and trailer. Havasu in the winter time is such an awesome place....peaceful, quiet, beautiful, nice breezes... shared the day with some other sailboat buddies as I got closer to home. Super way to get away right here at home. I posted the video on my blog:
