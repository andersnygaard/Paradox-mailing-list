I'd like to have 12 volt power aboard the little cat, but weight is a
huge issue.  I've thought about a motorcycle battery.  I'd like to be
able to run a spotlight at need, navigation lights occasionally, a
small deck light, a fishfinder, a VHF radio, a CD player, and maybe a
portable DVD player for entertainment at anchor.

I guess I need to do the arithmetic.  I was just looking at a
motorcycle battery with 14 amp hours.  Doesn't sound like much.
