Hi Derek,

I just went to the photos section and there was plenty of room to add to your album, I can't understand why you were not allowed to upload a picture unless you logged on with a different user ID. Please try again and let me know if the "add photo to album" link is grayed. When Yahoo changed to the new format they may have altered the settings but they look OK to me. Thanks and sorry for the trouble your having.

Glen
