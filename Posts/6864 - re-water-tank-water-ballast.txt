How many builders are using the tanks for drinking water? Some builders have mentioned that their tanks leak a little bit (some anyway).  In Annie Hill's book "Voyaging on a small income" she says that on their boat they have no holding tanks but use one gallon jugs for their water. So perhaps building the water tanks as two more holds for "general stores" they could hold water (say in 2 liter bottles) or tins of food or lead ballast as needed. Having more options usually is a good idea. I sure would like to hear from others.

Not me, I generally fill the tanks with whatever I am floating in.

I did make enquiries when building Little Jim and could not find an epoxy manufacturer who would recommend their product for sealing a drinking water tank.

I initially had problems of leakage from the inspection hatches as most are designed to keep water out rather than in. The latest ones seem to have solved that problem. I did have a period when I put 80kg of lead inside the (otherwise empty) tanks. With the inspection hatch closed this has the same ballast effect as 80 litres of water but would be neutrally buoyant in a swamping situation.
