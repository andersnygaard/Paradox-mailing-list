Subject: Chine modification info

As you may not be aware of, Matt has been experimenting with extending the chine forward on Paradox to improve the overall performance of the boat. (See photo in file section). However, after several trial sails, he feels that the modification has made very little difference, so he does not recommend the change. Since Matt is always trying to improve his designs, he is next considering testing a "Little Cruiser style" rudder on Paradox. Though I'm not sure what the difference is, Matt says that the balance point is different between the two. I guess I need to take a picture of it for everyone to see.
