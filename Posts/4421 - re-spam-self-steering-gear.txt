Subject: Re: [SPAM] Self -Steering -gear

I don't think this is the case with Paradox Steve, because I lock the steering line down and then only make minimal adjustments every five or ten minutes. But to tell you the truth I have not really tried letting her steer herself for very long. Next time I go out I'll give it a try and let you know if there is anything to your theory.

This topic has interested me for a long time. I would like to throw out, to everyone, an idea I read about once. I have not tried it myself yet. Anyway it is like this. To the aft side of the rudder axis you add a weight. It is in the form of a generaly horizontal shaft and a movable weight riding or sliding upon it. There is a lockscrew to fix it in position. This is above the waterline. You adjust the position of the weight on the shaft nearer to or farther from the rudder axis to control the amount coarse corection. Why this works is that as the hull heels the center of forward effort (as viewed from above) of the sail moves a bit to leeward of the center of resistance of the hull. The hull is relatively upwind of this and so the bow will want to round up to windward. Now what happens with this additional device is that the weight will fall down to leeward as the hull heels and input a fallingoffinfluence to the coarse and achieve a ballance! A hundred years ago this tactic was used on model sailboats. Joshua Slocumbe saw this and gave him couragement to try his own ingenuity. Or so I read. Thisweight idea "FITS" with the lead weight in the trailing edge of the rudderblade as Matt has shown on the plans. It not only sinks the bouyant wood rudder but also adds auto steering too. Or so it seems to me.
