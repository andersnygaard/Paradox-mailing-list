Subject: Re: Wood Stove Idea for Paradox

I have studied stove and hearth designs at some length and suggest you will have a much superior design if you attach the chimney flue toward the front of the fire box. I know it sounds odd but the fire flow should go around the bottom of the fire bed and return across the top before exiting the flue. With out going into a lot of theory, observe the way most fireplaces are constructed where the back wall is a fair distance behind the chimney exit near the front. I suggest that this may be the cause of the "smoke puffing" out the front.

Happy new Year
