Yeah, probably wouldn't handle very well with all that top weight.
Dogs? Oh, you're knocking my poor 3D skills. Heehee. I knocked that up in a few hours, but that's not an excuse - my modeling is shoddy at best.

I figured at LEAST 40 standard 4x8 sheets of plywood with plenty of scarfs. :P Even with very cheap plywood, that'd be close to $1000 bucks just for the wood bits.
Maybe fiberglass or even plank construction would be better/easier for something this size. I suspect there are fiberglass paradoxes out there, or even metal?, but has anyone tried planks (at least for the sides)?
