Hi Pete,

Have a look at two photos of my trailer I have uploaded to the Photos section in the 'Faith' album.

My trailer is unbraked and I can tow 'Faith' easily behind my Ford Mondeo. When launching and retrieving the boat, the wheels are always below the water, because I need that depth to get her off or on the trailer. The bearings are sealed, and so far I have had no problems with them.

Al has a much bigger trailer with an extended rear end, which means he can launch his 'Little Jim' without getting the wheels wet. His trailer is fitted with brakes.

Cheers,
Bill.
