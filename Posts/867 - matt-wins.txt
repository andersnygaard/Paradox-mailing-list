Subject: MATT WINS!

These Challengers have FINISHED and are WINNERS
 
Captain: Matt: Class 4, Single Male 
Boat Description: Paradox 14' coastal cruising sailboat, with chinese yuloh secondary propulsion. This is a heavy, long-range expedition cruiser and stretches the limits of beach-launchability (I'll be using rollers and block & tackle, should be fun to watch...). She is not fast but can keep sailing in any weather and run hairy inlets safe & dry. 
Start, 0 Miles
Fort Desoto: 3/8/03 07:00 Will be sailing to the start from Stuart, FL via the Okeechobee Waterway, scouting the Grande Tours & Venice CP's along the way. Planning to sail the race outside as much as possible but the weather will make the final call.
