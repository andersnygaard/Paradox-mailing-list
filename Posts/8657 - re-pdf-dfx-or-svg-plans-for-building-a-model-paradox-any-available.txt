Subject: Re: pdf, dfx or svg plans for building a model Paradox - any available?

The plans for Paradox are mostly to scale. Printing and cutting them out can get you a paper model. The bulkheads are 1:5 scale and the hull is 1:10 scale so you would need to change the scale when printing which might be as easy as printing the bulkhead pages 2 per page. Not sure, I didn't try that.

If you are a member of the Enigma sailboat group, you can download DXF files for the Engima 360.

Actually, now that I look, there are CAD files RIGHT HERE in this group's Files section.

I couldn't open the 3D one since I don't have a 3D CAD program but the 2D drawing opened with a free QCAD program.
