Subject: How much head room?

I've been thinking of building for a long time. In fact, I noticed that I left the third post in the group years ago.

I am thinking of doing the Columbia 150, a 150 mile journey on the Columbia River next August. Seems to me the Paradox would be pretty good. On the other hand, I'm not sure I am ready to build again, as my life is pretty busy. If I do, I wonder if I fit. Could someone tell me the distance from the floor to the ceiling? I am very long in the torso.

I may also buy a pre-built Pelican. Still thinking. If I am going to build I will need to get right on it.

Thanks

Bryan
