I collected the sail on Friday. Got the boat far enough out of the garage to fit the mast and hoist away. ..... Hard work isn't it?

By winding on enough rope to fill the reefing spool I was able to make the furling work, just, but I don't see it as a practical set-up as lowering the sail had to be done in 3 inch steps (and it gave me blisters!) So a topping lift it is, and back to the chandlers for a double block to go in the vent trunk.

I made a rig with similar geometry to yours, Glen, but a bit simpler. The line goes over a mast-head block and then splits to each end of the boom. Once I got the lengths right it seemed to work ok.

What size rope are you using? The 6mm suggested in the plans seems a tad thin for easy handling.

Hoping for calm nights
