If you are thinking of mounting a wind genny on a Paradox I would look at mounting it on the fore deck. It would be clear of all control lines/sails etc and in free air. The only downside is the occasional wave which comes over the deck (if you sail in the sort of waters that I do).

Hoping for calm nights
