Subject: Plans have arrived....sawdust soon followed

To all my fellow PARADOXIANS,

My set of PARADOX plans arrived in the mail this past Friday...(Kudos to Dave for an extremely pleasant wait of less than 1 week) Saturday morning was spent at the local lumber yard picking out material for deck beams and bulkheads...

Today (Monday) I plan on shopping for a new digital camera so I can document and share with you all the construction and eventual launching of my Paradox, ENDEAVOUR.

I can only hope that when all is said and done the greatest honor that could be bestowed on me would to compare ENDEAVOUR to the recently lost ZOE. By using Matt's plans and ZOE as an example hopefully the Paradox family will be proud of my effort...

So much more to follow....

Safe Passages To All,
Greg
