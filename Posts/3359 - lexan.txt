Does anybody know what adhesive I can use to fasten pieces of polycarbonate together. I've got lots of scraps and I thought that they may do for making boxes for my electrical outputs but it is Sunday and the firm I bought the polycarb from is shut.

BTW I found a source for copper wire yesterday. Look for a place where shopfitters are remodelling. They seem to rip out and start again. The skip was full of wiring and electrical fittings. It is not as full now:0)
