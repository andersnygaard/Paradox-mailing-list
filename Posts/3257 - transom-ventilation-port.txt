Subject: Transom ventilation Port

Hi All,

I'm getting ready for the 2006 sailing season and have a few questions 
for those of you who have installed the transom ventilation port. I did 
not install it for the fear of losing the cover and taking on water. 
Ventilation has not been a big problem for me, but in my opinion, you 
can never have too much ventilation, especially here in the south with 
the heat.

1)Has anybody had any trouble with the port? Losing the cover? putting 
the cover on in rough weather? (Hanging over the transom)

2)Is there a significant difference in air flow with the cover off vs 
on?

3) Any opinions on the subject?

Best Regards,
David Beard
