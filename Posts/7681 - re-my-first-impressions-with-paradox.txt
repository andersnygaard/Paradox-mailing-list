Subject: Re: My first impressions with Paradox

Yes Bill, I've been watching your progress on "Minnow" and feel more than a little fortunate in having acquired Ironsides. I sure envy your knowledge however, since I'm not much of a sailor- yet (I hope). But that's life, when you do one thing, you can't do the other. I've spent my life learning wilderness survival (that's my research subject, I'm a university professor), not sailing, as you have. So I doubly appreciate all the information you have provided here and on your blog. BTW, you were wondering about the name "Minnow", my suggestion would be to call your boat "Good enuf", you keep saying that as you fix it up, and it keeps the original name too. Just an idea. Or, "Great enuf".

What excites me is that after so many years of trying so many different sailboats, you are for the first time going back to one you already had. Speaks very loudly in favor of the Paradox! Can't wait to sail mine again. Soon.

Again, congratulations for making Enuf shiny again. You've got all of my admiration, keep up the great work.

André
