Subject: Re: Hogfish and Jubilee

The original "Hogfish" does have external chine logs/chine runners that run full length. She was built very heavily like Little Cruiser (NORTHE- No other route thought heavy enough) and was sailed extensively by Chris as far South as the Virgin Islands. I had the pleasure to sail aboard her years ago in the Bahamas in a stiff breeze (30+ knots and 8 foot seas), and she handled those conditions admirably. Over the years she has come up on the market several times, and Mindy and I have been very tempted to buy her. However, we live far inland and really have no need for a liveaboard boat.  

In regards to a smaller sharpie, I talked to Chris about this too, showing him Matts Layden's sketches of his 23 footer. He said he could knock out a hull like that in like 2 weeks if memory serves me correctly. Of course that's only a small part of the whole project, and I don't think we spoke of it much more. 

By the way, Chris is a boat builder by trade, and he has put together a large variety of craft in power and sail. I haven't spoken to him now in maybe 5-6 years so I'm not sure what he is up to today; but the moderator of the Paradox builder's forum, Glen Maxwell, keeps in regular contact with him.
