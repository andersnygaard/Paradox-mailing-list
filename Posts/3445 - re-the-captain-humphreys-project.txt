Subject: Re: The Captain Humphreys Project

It's entertaining, but I have my doubts the Captain will set sail next winter as he maintains.  The time schedule is too short for building and testing before the off. Some people believe it's just a stunt, but whatever, I enjoy the web site for the fun it gives and its originality.
