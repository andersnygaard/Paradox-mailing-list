I'm afraid that won't work Jack, Epoxy , unlike polyester is a molecular bonding and not a chemical reaction. If your mix ratio is 5:1 then the hardener molecule bonds to 5 resin molecules to form the reaction. If it doesn't set after the afore mentioned procedures in earlier posts then the only thing to do is scrape it off........... be there, done that......
