Subject: Re: Chine runner efficiency.

Designer Jeff Gilbert is looking at chine runners on a dory sided hull. I added drawing to the photo section - "Gumboot+Mono"

Quite frankly when I first looked at that I thought it was a joke. But then knowing about Jeff - he is serious:-)

It is one half of his Gumboots Cat. It certainly points out graphically the challenge it would be to keep a hull like that upright. And how a sharpie hull would work a lot better.

Not saying that a person might not want to try it. Have any of his designs ever been built I wonder?

Cheers, Nels
