Subject: Re: Lil Cruiser Plans

There were no real plans drawn up for Little Cruiser though I do have some basic measurements that Matt Layden gave me. However, to be perfectly honest, LC is not that much bigger than Paradox since she too was basically a solo boat. The fact is that Mindy and I are used to squeezing into small spaces like tents, micro-cruisers and compact cars for long periods of time. My recommendation to most experienced builders is to scale the 4.2m Paradox design up a wee bit,10 - 20%, giving you a boat that is 4.6m to 5m long. On the other hand, a better idea might be to simply build an existing design that is somewhat larger. One possibility that comes to mind is the NIS18

Finally, I have talked to Matt Layden several times about drawing up a set of plans for a larger sharpie, but he hasn't come up with anything that I am aware of.  Still you never know... Matt's the kind of person who accomplishes amazing things quickly when he is in the mood.
