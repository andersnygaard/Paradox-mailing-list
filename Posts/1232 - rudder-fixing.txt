I've been studying the plans for Paradox and wonder about the rudder blade fixing, which appears to be a bolt upon which the blade swings vertically.

Has this proved to be adequate?  What would happen if the boat were to ground and for some reason the rudder was not immediately lifted and an unfair strain was caused by the boat being thrown to one side by wind and waves?

I seek the opinions of those who have sailed the little boat.

Bill.
