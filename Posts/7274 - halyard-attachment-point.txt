Hi Alastair

No cut-out on my new sail, since I was unsure of exactly where to put it I took the easy way out and eliminated it.. I had the sailmaker add an extra sacrificial patch 600mm long to absorb chafe.
Could always make a cut out later if I find it necessary 

I noticed with the previous sail that when there was a chop and on port tack, the sail rubbed aginst the mast, fore and aft, more than the length of the slot. Never seemed to do much harm though.

best

Jim
