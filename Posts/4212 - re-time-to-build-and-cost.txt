Subject: Re: Time to build and cost?

Hello Steve.  This is not an exactly equivelent boat, but I'm building a Philsboat by Jim M.  I'm now about to start the process of finishing epoxing the chines, and will soon be starting the (dreaded) bottom glass and epoxy.   I have not measured my time, but I bet I have less that 45 hours into the project.   I own my own business, have to manage my employees, and am raising two young children.  I completely know what its like to have to "steal" time away to do frivolous things like  boatbuilding.

The Philsboat is like the paradox in that you can sit "inside" to "drive".   It is probably not as seaworthy, but it has other positive attributes.   There are a lot of parts, and a fair amount of complexity to the Paradox.  If you want to do a fast build, you may want to look at other boats (like the Jim Michalak boats).
