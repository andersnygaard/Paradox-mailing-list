Subject: For Pete's sake - WHY...

Hello...

Well I am scabbing Meranti from work and bits of Starboard and old valves and bits and bobs in anticipation of pissing my wife off and claiming the garage in which she now parks her precious Mini...

Yet I still get asked 'why' by my fellow 'big marshmallow' yacht building co-workers, and I really can't give their rednecker faces a straight answer - so I re-pose the question here - WHY...

WHY - do you like the Paradox as is - are you all ex-fighter pilots - do you hate multihulls - are you afraid of technology and complexity - are you ex-land-campers that got caught poaching and are on the run - HEHE...

WHY are you building Layden's Paradox...

I may make a digest of replies - those that do not tell me to go and get stuffed...

Yes - I am looking to justify my own insanity - always a dodgie' job...

Cheers...
