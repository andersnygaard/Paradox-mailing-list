Hey.. Congrats!
Didn't think it would be this soon. I am considering moving back to Seattle in the future. (most likely 2010) I spent a large part of my teen years tearing up the town there and have recently made contact with old friends. I was wondering, do they still allow street performers at Pikes Place Market? I cut my teeth performing sleight of hand there and attending magic classes at the magic shop.

Hi Bill. I'm building a paradox. I'm just finishing up now and I should 
be launching this month sometime. I'm waiting for a sail kit to arrive 
from SailRite. You can see something of my boat in the photos section 
under Ironsides. Good Luck, Steve ,on Puget Sound.

Been gone for a little while and just wondering who if anyone is in 
the process of building a paradox.
