Hi Ian and welcome on board.

As far as plywood goes, I dithered for a while and eventually went for the cheapest option, which was Far Eastern marine ply from Clarks Wood. They have a local yard to you in Uxbridge, in fact my 12mm sheets had to be sourced from there rather than Bristol.For the recommended ply it cost me =A3333.62 which included VAT and delivery to my doorstep. There's better ply, but as most will be sheathed and painted I can't justify the expense on my tight budget!

I got my Douglas Fir from Robbins in Bristol and so far have spent =A3237, but I haven't purchased enough for the Cabin trunk or spars yet. Bill sorted me out with the majority of my ring nails.

I'm using MAS Flag epoxy for my bonding and will switch to low viscosity when the time comes for sheathing duties. It's also a bit cheaper than the alternatives and should be blush free with medium and slow hardener. So far I've scrounged 20Kgs of scrap lead and building my stock up gradually. I have to visit a plumber/roofer acquaintance who says he can sort me out with the rest. I'm not sure what sort me out means, but I'm hoping it'll just mean a bottle of whiskey or the like in exchange!

I've got a building blog running at http://www.freewebs.com/paradoxbuild/buildingblog.htm which I try to update when i get a chance.

I haven't mentioned my first monumental C**K up yet. When building the stem the figures in brackets are HALF widths. Yes that's all of them including the one at deck level! The stem looked lovely with that nice curve on it. I've now discovered that epoxy filler makes a wonderful hide all the bodges construction medium....
I don't think I'd have got away with it for a glass cabinet :-)

Cheers
Pete
