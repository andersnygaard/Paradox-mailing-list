Subject: Re: Enuf Epoxy

Thanks Jack

When I got every thing functioning again (shame it had to go faulty on the most expensive single sheathing job; I've had to buy myself a solar panel to help me get over it) I put some fresh mix on the bow end of the hull underside and also sheathed one side of the rudder blade. Both have set hard.

Now the big question! Should I apply a coat of epoxy over the whole tacky hull bottom and leave it at that?
Con:- if it all peels off first time I beach her the hull is fairly unprotected
Pro:- save all the stripping off and cost of new biax which although still tacky to the touch seems to be stuck to glass mat on sides where I turned it over the edge, can always redo it next year if all goes wrong - got three years until the big trip.

All advice welcome from experience epoxiers. I've got 36 hours to consider this because I'm off to a stately home tomorrow. As a National Trust member it is my middle class duty to help the upper classes maintain their fancy drums in the manner to which they have too long been accustomed
