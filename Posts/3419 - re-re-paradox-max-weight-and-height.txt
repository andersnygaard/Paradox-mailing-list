Hey James, 

Regarding your question about accessing the forward compartment, the plans suggest 
leaving it as a solid bulkhead unless you need to carry the mast and spars inside. In 
that case, you would need to create a hole in the bulkhead to accommodate their length. 
I haven't heard of anyone needing to access the forward compartment for storage 
purposes, as there seems to be plenty of accessible space in other areas of the boat. 

If you're worried about feeling claustrophobic, then opening up bulkhead two probably 
won't solve the problem. My wife thought it felt like a sidecar on a motorbike. Although, 
it could be a unique way of moving the boat around! 

It's definitely possible to modify the Paradox along those lines, though it would require 
redesigning the vent/control line box on the port side and strengthening the ship where 
bulkhead two currently is. One of the Antipodean builds has already opened out the 
bulkhead on the port side, so it's definitely doable. 

Hope that helps! 

Best, 

D. Clark
