Subject: 19mm ply for bottom?

Hi,

The plans call for 18mm ply for bottom but the ply i want to use only comes in 19mm. Do you think that will be ok or will it snap?

The ply is here: http://boatcraft.com.au/Shop/index.php?main_page=3Dindex&amp;cPath=3D56_60

Australian hoop pine ply, supposedly top of the line.

Thanks
