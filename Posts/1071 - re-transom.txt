Whoops. Brain fart.

One page (1), the transom is drawn without any crown to the side framing. On page (2), the transom is shown with a significant amount of crown applied to the side framing, and it appears as though the plans were at one time corrected to this end (a faint line shows on my copy). On page (8), it looks like the transom has 5mm +/- crown as drawn, but is not specified. Also, Blkd #4 is drawn without any crown to the side framing.

I don't mind the extra work of compound curvature (as it exists already, up fwd), but if the transom was in fact designed without it, I will eliminate the possibility. Anyone know FOR CERTAIN what was intended? It is certainly possible that I have missed a note pertaining to this detail.

My stem exhibits a LOT of compound curvature, as constructed to the plan specs (29 deg max bevel). I know that it will need a fair bit of whittling during the dry run of the sides. I may introduce the 5mm crown to the transom sides and plan on whittling them too.

Any thoughts?

Thanks,
DC
