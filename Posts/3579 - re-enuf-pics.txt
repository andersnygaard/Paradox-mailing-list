Local waters seem to inspire local boats. In the days
of sailing working craft there were always huge
regional differences in the designs because of the
different conditions weren't there?

I was chatting to Al about this just a few weeks ago
and he came up with a plausible theory. He thought
that the American fondness for sharpies was due to the
availabilty of very wide planks over there. Bigger
trees there you see. Before plywood you needed wide
boards to make a flat bottomed boat.

They always used to say that the English Channel bred
very short steep seas and the old British prewar yacht
was narrow and deep - like a plank on edge- to deal
with these seas.
