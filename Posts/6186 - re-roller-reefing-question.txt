Subject: Re: Roller reefing question

Hi Kellan,

Yes, even Matt's plans evolved a bit on the roller reefing design. On the original plans, the bottom tube rope connects to the next piece of the structure. In May of 1996, he revised the plan to show it connected using the split 'Y' type fittings.

This was mentioned not so very long ago.
Here's the original drawing.

Obviously this simple method didn't cut the mustard.
