Hello Paradoxians,

As we near toward the end the 2022 sailing year, I take an opportunity to reflect and add a picture that reminds me of a wonderful memory the "Edge" provided me.

Please feel free to share a memory that occurred last year your paradox gave you. This portal may not be the flash that Facebook provides but the history in this site is gold. Information from year past are in this portal and it would be wonderful to keep the portal alive.

Below is a sail I took on Oneida Lake in Central New York, US. I was sailing and rockin n rollin.
