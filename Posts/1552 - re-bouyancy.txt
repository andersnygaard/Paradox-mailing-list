You can figure about 55 lbs of bouyancy for every cubice foot of foam you use.  You can add enough foam, or empty air bladders/bottle/containers to make the boat float at any level you choose.  The lower the foam the higher the deck will be out of water, but you alos may be giving up valuable floor space that way.
