Hi Bill,

I've just copied this from the files; perhaps Glenn has tried both? If not, Matt obviously has and he prefers the new version; see last sentence of below:

Glen has been unhappy with his sail and we've discussed on a couple occasions what he might do to improve the current one or if he builds a new one from scratch. I just made a new sail for Paradox this Feb. The old sail is pretty tired but still useable, I wanted to get a new one on while there's still some life in the old so I can carry it as a spare. Thought some of you might be interested in how it turned out.

I experimented with the overall dimensions a little, shortening the foot to reduce the overhang of the boom, and raising the peak a little to get a higher aspect ratio. The downside of these changes is a sail that doesn't reef and furl quite as nicely, which was more of a priority in the original design; there is a triangle of sail at the peak that doesn't roll up now and it has to be manually scrunched up and stuffed under the boom when stowing the sail. Not a big deal but not as neat and clean as it was. The upside is a slightly better setting and more weatherly sail, either full sail or reefed. Below are the dimensions of the new sail if anyone wants to try it out. I still stand by the ond sail as in the plans, it works fine and if you have one that is well cut there is no need to change it, but I would go with the new version again if making another.
