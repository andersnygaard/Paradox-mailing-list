Subject: Re: I just discovered Paradox

Thanks very much for the information, Dave. I'm very intrigued by Sand Flea as well as Paradox; in fact, I first learned about Matt when I ran across references to Sand Flea in discussion of the Texas 200. I saw a quote somewhere that Matt planned to make Sand Flea plans available eventually, but I haven't heard any more on that subject. I imagine he's more focused on Enigma at the moment.

There are a few things about building Paradox that scare me, and I'll post questions on them when I have some more time. (I can sum up by saying that small details don't worry me, and hours of sanding, epoxying, etc. are no problem. But complex, tricky operations that have to be done all in one go definitely scare me, and Paradox seems to have a few of those.)

The blog of the construction of "Johanna" at http://www.freewebs.com/paradoxbuild has been tremendously informative.
