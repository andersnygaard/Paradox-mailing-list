Hi Stuart,

The ply sitting on the screw nails is a piece of "Paraply" from South America. It's great for interior furniture, but don't use it in boats as it will not withstand a boil test. The piece with the screw nails in it is exterior AC ply of 1/4 inch thickness. I just grabbed what was handy to illustrate the paint/glue board concept.
