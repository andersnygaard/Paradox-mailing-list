Subject: Re: Adding 3-4" to cabin top?

I would be reluctant to increase the height of the mast-step:  I feel that the mast already has insufficient bury.

Best wishes,

So if two inches are added to the mast, will the mast be too long to store inside?  How much clearance do completed Paradox's have when storing the mast?  Do navigation lights have to be removed?  While we are at it: What navigation lights have people been pleased with?

If the mast step were raised an inch or two, that would increase the height of the rig without lengthening the mast as much.  Wonder what increasing the the step would do to the other parts of the Rubik's cube.  It would put a little more stress on the partner  The sheer was going to be raised an inch as well, so not too much more stress.
