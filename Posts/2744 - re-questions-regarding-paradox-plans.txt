- Is a continuous/piano hinge used on stateroom sole hatch, just
like the cabin sole hatches,  or standard hinges?

I've made all my hinges up from webbing and copper tacks and left out the "stateroom" 
divider. I couldn't imagine lifting any thing over it while laying on my side. i put a floor 
right across, hinged down the middle with the port side fixed and starboard side lifting. i 
left out the bin in that compartment and so have storage on the floor across the full width 
and beneath the floor.

That's a neat hinge system.  I also like your mods.  Thanks.  I'd
sure like to see more pictures of Paradox examples.
