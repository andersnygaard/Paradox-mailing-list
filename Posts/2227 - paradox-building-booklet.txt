Subject: Paradox Building Booklet

Greetings All,

I got My Paradox Building Manula from Don Elliot yesterday. I am sure glad I ordered it, Very Informative and Interesting. I should be getting My plans next week sometime. I am ready to start building! Matt sure put a lot of thought in to the Paradox, I am amazed at how Well planned this boat is, I don't think He missed anything.

Take Care,

Dave Blow
