I have to agree - that tool list is wildly excessive - would cost more than the boat! Is the intended audience trying to build a workshop or a boat!?!

You don't NEED any of the stationary tools - that just saved you well over $5,000! I have a set of boat plans that are far more fiddly than a Paradox (the stem alone is much more architectural than Pardoxes') and when the designer and his wife built the prototype, the only power tools where an electric drill and an electric planer (not sure what that is exactly) - and they "hired" a circular saw to knock the edges off the mast. I don't plan to go quite that spartan, but I was (literally) thrilled to discover that I did not need a bandsaw to work up the stem!

If you're trying to point this boat to the "gentleman woodcrafter" market, the tools list might (MIGHT!) be appropriate. A much better tack would be to go for the absolute minimum list, with a supplementary "these make it easier" list and then, if you must, the "luxury, easy living" tools list!
