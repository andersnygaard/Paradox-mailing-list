Subject: Thanks everyone...

Thanks everyone for all the encouragement in building Paradox.  I don't mean to try to discourage anyone from trying to build one themselves.  It's just that it's best to know what your getting yourself into before you begin.  If I am not mistaken, Matt Layden took around 3 1/2 months of very full-time work to complete the project.  He is a fast and experienced builder. I would take at least three or four times longer working part time. I think Don Elliott took a year of part-time labor to finish his.  Maybe Glen can tell us how long it took him to finish ZOE.  Still, I believe that it is best to build something simple to get your feet wet so to speak.  Completing a small project gives you the confidence and some of the skills necessary to tackle larger ones.  Also you might need to acquire a few new tools along the way to make things go more easily.  Don Elliott does a great job in his "Building Paradox" articles on how to make some neat little tools, and he makes some useful suggestions on which tools you will need to make the job go quicker. I think I wood rate this project at a medium difficulty level.
