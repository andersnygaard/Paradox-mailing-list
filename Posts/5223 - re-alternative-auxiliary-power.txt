Yes, a Minn Kota 28lb thrust.

80Ah AGM deep cycle. I charge it at home before I set off and again 
when I get back. While afloat it runs my echo sounder &amp; gps and 
charges my vhf and phone. It will also power an electric bilge pump 
(never been used in anger) and internal &amp; nav LEDs. I carry a mains 
charger on board, but have never used it while afloat. After my 3 
week trip with Bill it was still about 80% charged.

The idea is that I don't use it at all, and that is generally the way 
it works out. I keep it stowed out of the way up in the bow and it 
takes about 5 mins to get it installed, so unless I really need it, 
or want to travel more than a couple of miles, I don't bother and 
just use the yuloh. The only place I have used it regularly is at one 
of my launch sites which is about a mile up a narrow river. I got 
*very* tired of sculling back up against the current, but as I am 
about to lift out I don't mind using up my 'fuel'.

Hoping for calm nights
