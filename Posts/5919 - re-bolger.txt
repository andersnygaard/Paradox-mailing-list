Subject: Re: Bolger

I think Jim considers Bolger to be a major influence in his designs. Without Bolger, it would be doubtful that Jim would have ever made the designs he has. The Bolger users do have their own group, at the same time, we can learn much from discussions pertaining to Bolger and his boats.
