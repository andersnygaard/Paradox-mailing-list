Subject: Re: [paradoxsailboat] Motor on the Paradox

I've mounted the sheet ropes on the rear deck near where the cabin intersects the rear deck either side, that has helped control the lines getting around the motor. I'm away from my boat and can't send a pic.

My paradox had a trolling motor that I had cut the control head off to mount inside. The trolling motor worked great. It did not have much range, but it did have enough to take care of my minimal power needs. I have a 2.5 HP outboard, and when looking to fit it on the Dox, I just could not get past the weight and the sheeting issues. Others may have had better luck but a trolling motor cut in half is vary small, unobtrusive, and does not foil sheets.

Hello Paradoxians,

There are those who enjoy having a motor on the paradox for many reasons, while others hate the entanglement the motor causes with the sheet.

I have attached two pictures I found on the Internet of a paradox where one can see the potential issues with the motor as the sheet dances with it.

What comments, solutions, and thoughts could you share regarding the mounting of a motor on the stern of the dox and the logistics of the managing the sheet?

The pictures below display the potential problems with the sheet lines. I remember seeing a dox with a trolling motor mounted onto the side.

Do most paradox sailers use the motor? I have been sailing for three years without a motor and limited to lakes whereby I there are no currents or tides.
