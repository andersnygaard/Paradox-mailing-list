Hi David,

Not sure about other areas of the country but works well for me in the North East Atlantic seaboard is a el cheepo broken back "rebel" style lure, I get them at wal-mart for about $4 called a atom bomber. I get the best response when you can feel a vibration on the line, seems the fish hear or feel it and hit it. I get striper bass,bluefish, and weakfish. also I use a steel leader as they can sometimes drag the line to the rocks and also the line can be biten by feeding schools. be very carefull handling line as you can loose a finger VERY easy if a loop gets you and a fish is on!!

Jack
