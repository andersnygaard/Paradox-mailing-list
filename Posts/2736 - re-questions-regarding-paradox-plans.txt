I'm going through the paradox plans, trying to develop a
comprehensive parts list for myself.  I'm up to page 7 and I have
a backlog of questions that I hope people here can answer for
me.:

- The term "P&amp;S" are used throughout the plans; but what does it
mean?

port ansd starbord

Doh!  OK, that makes sense.  Thanks.

- How many yards of 38" wide woven roving (three layers on
bottom) and 50" 6.0 oz fiberglass matte (one layer everywhere
else) to order?  I estimated 28 yards and 20 yards respectively,
with plenty of extra scrap.  Enough?  *Way* too much?

I used Biax, so I dont know

Why did you use biax over roving?  I might as well, depending.
Sorry for the potentially dumb question, but I have never worked
with fiberglass or epoxy before.  I see biax has a matt backing;
are multiple layers of biax ok like with roving?

- As far as I can tell, the length of the mast, boom and yard are
not given in the plans-- Especially if using the new sail that
Matt designed.

I used 1 by 4 inch doug fir porch flooring, clear, 16 footers, work in 
metric it is easier.

OK, so 16 feet is your finished mast length (ignoring the
lighting rod)?  That's what I'm most curious about.

- Is a continuous/piano hinge used on stateroom sole hatch, just
like the cabin sole hatches,  or standard hinges?

I used piano hinge, your going to be standing on that door.

No, no, not the cabin hatches, but instead the forward
"stateroom" hatch.  Continuous/piano hinge as well?
