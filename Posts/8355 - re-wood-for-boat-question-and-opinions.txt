Subject: Re: Wood for Boat Question and opinions

Thank you for your response, Malcolm. 

I found a lumber yard that is four hour drive. They stock the DF for boat building and allow customers to select their wood from the yard. I shall plan a trip on a weekend to get the lumber for the mast and spars.

A beginner's question regarding the mast shaping: Does one epoxy the mast wood together then shape (taper) the mast -- such as decreasing circumference toward the top of the mast -- or have folks kinda shaped the individual strips then epoxied the pieces together? 

Much appreciation to those who have the skills and knowledge and most of all the patience for new learners,
