Hello everyone,

It's official, Small Fry rounded Cape Leeuwin on the 22nd Feb this year. She sailed on to the south east of Cape Leeuwin to anchor at Seal Island. I've posted some new photos of the event under Small Fry. 

Rounding the cape proved to be quite a job, with a SE wind blowing up to about 20knots and waves getting ever bigger, it took many repeated approaches before I finally got around the last bit of the cape (I tried over and over for several hours). There was a lull in the wind and the waves moderated for a short time... I was able to raise more sail and make better windward progress which is what enabled the final rounding. The lull didn't last long and I found the whole area to be the most menacing place I've ever sailed. Small Fry has sailed in stronger winds and bigger seas, but that was in the relative safety of open ocean far out to sea. Near Cape Leeuwin there are reefs and islands everwhere, waves break and squirt white froth into the air even though there appears to be no reef visable, and the wind and wave conditions change very rapidly. The worst issue was that I was on a very ugly looking lee shore and I was scared that if something went wrong I'd be bashed up against it in no time. 

Anyway, Small Fry made it to Seal Island where she anchored on a rock bottom for two nights. The second night I measured 20knot gusts in the protected lee of the island! I had a sleepless night wishing I'd taken more chain and a spare anchor. The next day in more reasonable conditions we fled the area. I was glad to get out of there and out into open water, but also glad to have achieved the rounding. I think I'll leave it to others to round the other two capes ;)

Cheers,
Geoff (Small Fry, Fremantle, Western Australia).
