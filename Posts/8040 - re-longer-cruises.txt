Hi Geoff,

What sort of cushioning did you use on your seat? That is the biggest 
problem I have with longer journeys.

I have a number of cushions of different construction (foam, 
inflatable, jell etc) which I swap round every couple of hours but I 
still end up a bit tender.

(Maybe if I lost some weight it would reduce my seat loading??)
