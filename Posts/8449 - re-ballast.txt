Others can correct me if I’m wrong, but this is what I gather from the plans.

The plan calls for 70- 180 kg lead pigs etc.  This equals to 154 to 396 lbs.
To this you must add the weight of the water tank, which contain 70 liters which weight 70 kilograms or 154 lbs.

This means that with full tanks, Matt suggests 308 lbs to 550 lbs of ballast.  When tanks are empty, I believe that the gear stored under the floorboards compensates for the 154 lbs missing, since with empty tanks it means you’ve been in cruising mode for quite a while (therefore are carrying a lot of gear).  Which is most likely why Matt suggests a variance in the “lead pigs etc.” of 242 lbs.

I think this means the Paradox was designed to sail best with between 300 and 550 lbs of ballast. My “Iota” holds 300 lbs of permanently fixed ballast in the form of bricks.  This leaves 250 lbs of moveable ballast in the form of tied-down batteries and extra anchors, as well as canned goods, tools and bottled water in the compartments under the floor.  The 50-75 lbs of camping gear and my body above floor level I do not consider ballast even if they probably contribute.  I believe this is just about right, since the boat feels like a keel boat when loaded at that weight.

Does this make sense?
