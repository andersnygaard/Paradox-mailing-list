Hi Nels,

Thanks for the over-arching compliment on design. 

The beer thing? Yes, I would have to agree with you about our generally pitiful commercial beer quality. However, there are literally hundreds of small, hand crafted breweries operating in local geographic regions who make some of the best beer I've ever had. Since when does the need for a really high alcohol content create a truly outstanding beer?

Here's the kicker, Nels.... I live in Utah where the beer you can buy at any corner convenience store is the same crap that is sold on U.S. military bases with an alcohol content of 3.2%. My mouthwash has more alcohol than that, for crissakes!  I'll be happy to accept your 5.5% argument when you put yourself on a steady diet of thirty-deuce, as it was called on the Army bases.

Actually, I'm not so sure about the beer on the bases anymore as I'm way out of touch with anything having to do with that part of my youth. 

Perhaps the real reason for the unique qualities of higher alcohol beers is the odd critter, or two, who slip into the vat during the adding of the hops where they impart their own "organic uniqueness" to the blend?
