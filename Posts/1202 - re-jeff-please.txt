Hi Paddler Jeff.

I'm still here. Lurking.

I am still going to build a PARADOX but still have not started yet due to work commitments.

I had the pleasure of meeting Alistair yesturday when he came into Cowes in LITTLE JIM.

It's amazing how much room Matt has designed into that little boat. His tale on the voyage from Poole Harbour will be quite interesting. Strong winds and wind against tide. You name it they had it.

My drawings for a 16 foot version of a PARADOX type are finished with enough information that I could build it but I must admit to just stretching PARADOX by 8" to give me the same living space as my 16 foot design.

My building area is taken up with two boats at this moment, one I am selling and the other I have to make a trailer using the space of the first one (?). I think thats right. Where does all the time go? My sailing cruiser is still in the garden, where it stayed throughout the summer. I have only managed to go sailing once this year with some friends on their boat, and the I could only manage about 3 hours.

Things should ease off next year. But then I was told that last year. Anyone want to buy 5 gallons of 3 year old epoxy. Just joshing.
