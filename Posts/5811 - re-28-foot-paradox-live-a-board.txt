Capt. Nemo,

Since your hull is already finished and you are happy with how you did it - the rest of your ideas look fine as well.

Personally I would have considered a narrower hull for better sailing performance. Say 6 feet wide. But that is a minor point. As John mentions you will need more ballast to get those chine runners down far enough to be effective.
