Subject: Boat Launchramp

I live in the tiny village of Manchester. We have a boat launchramp too. It's location is, for anyone interested, 47 deg. 33' 21.16" N by 122 deg. 32' 35.41" W. During the work week it is used very little. East of here is the Seattle skyline. Sometimes in the summer evenings the golden light of sunset will reflect off many of the glass windows in that city and give us a show of "golden diamonds". I've seen these from my kayak mostly. My neighbor has too many trees for me to see this from my home. Our winter wind storms always miss his trees too.

Cheers,
Steve Yahn
