How would you suggest the yard should be modified to minimize sag, 
at best to eliminate it?

I hadn't actually noticed any sag on my yard (but then I haven't been 
looking), but it would certainly be easy to increase the depth of the 
yard to make it stiffer. 

If an estimate could be made of how much it is bending, a yard could 
be made with that much initial bend (in the opposite direction) so in 
use it was straight.

difference to a sail of this type? </ignorance mode>
