Thanks Larry for posting the link. Great to see the side by sides of Whisper and Zoe, and the shots of Zoe under sail were especially enticing.

Welcome Matt, and thanks for the input regarding the new sail. I hope that you will continue to stop in once and a while. You have a truly remarkable design in Paradox.
