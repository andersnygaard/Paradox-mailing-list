Hi Bill,

A comparison of the two sails would not be fair to yours because it was 
cut to flat. It was built by a sail maker with out experience in lug 
rigs, therefore the bend in the yard was not taken into consideration. 
Once your yard is finished, support each end on saw horses or chair 
backs and suspend a fifty pound weight from the center. Tie a string 
from end to end and measure the distance from the string to the yard at 
the 25%, 50% and 75% of length points. Those measurements will represent 
the curvature that will need to be put into your sail. Once that is done 
you will have a fine sail that will set well. Just as a note off 
interest, while sailing with Matt, he commented that your sail looked 
like it needed about 2 inches of curvature (under my yard, yours may be 
different) when measured the amount was 2 inches, underscoring Matt eye 
for detail.

As I have your old sail, perhaps you could let me know how much
better the mark two version is. Does it give an extra half knot when
going to windward in force 3 ?
