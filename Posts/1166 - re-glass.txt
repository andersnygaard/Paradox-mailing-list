In the microcruising group in the files section under the folder "posted pictures-2" there is an article called "BRIS LIFE.doc" by Sven which says in part

"I settled for polyester-fibers, known as Dacron in the United States. Sailors know the material best in the form of sails and ropes. Glass-fibers have an elongation of four percent before they break; Kevlar, 2.5 percent. Carbon fibers have an elonga-tion of 1.5 percent, and they get stiffer and more brittle. Dacron fibers have an elonga-tion of 17 percent. A material's ability to absorb energy is its elongation multiplied by its strength. If 17 percent doesn't seem much, think about how much harder a blow is to a concrete floor compared with one to a wood floor. It's that little, al-most unnoticeable, deflection that makes the difference. NM-Epoxy has formulated a resin compatible with the Dacron fibers, also with 17-percent elongation. The foam I am using is two-inch-thick elastic Klegecell Ductile, a linear PVC with closed cells"
