Boat Name

Choosing a name for newly born child is difficult enough, but choosing a name for a boat is even more difficult. Why? Because there are only a limited number of names one can choose for child, although there are millions of them, but a boat can have a male or female name, or one without a gender connection, either neuter or abstract; thus the choice is greatly magnified.

There are numerous reasons determining the choice of a name for a boat; for example, it could be sentimental, an expression of the boats character, be named after someone or something pleasing, a connotation with literature or art, or symbolic of the boat's function, even perhaps a business connection, beside many others.

I'm currently building a Paradox micro-sailboat and I am struggling to find a name for the boat; one that has significance for me. I would like the name to reflect the boat's character – something that is essentially unique, expressive of an innate spirit, but aptly applicable to `her', `him' or `it'.

I currently have a list of about 80 names from which to choose. (See list below.) If you'd like to help me in my agonizing choice by expressing a preference, please choose one name from the list and give your reasons for suggesting I should use it.

If you do not find a name on the list that appeals to you, but you have one that may be appropriate – suitable complimentary names only – please publish it and give your reasons for your suggestion.

Bill.
