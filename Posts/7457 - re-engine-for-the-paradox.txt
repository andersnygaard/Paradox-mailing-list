Hi ,

well wrong ! If you just charge on the go, YES, but if you go on long journeys you will have enough time to charge your batteries ! I do that for over two decades now and Solar is getting better and better !
Do you ever go 2000 and so miles along shore with a boat upstream, on a wild river... c'mon.....
If you have a tiny small generator it will work very fine !
I think a 3-4 hp outboard is a minimum for a long tour !
But, that's just my 5cents, will be right for me but maybe not for other people! It all depends what you do with your boat !
