Congratulations on the launch and the fine looking boat.

I noticed in particular the photos showing Johanna being eased into the water, and I'm wondering how your trailer configuration works for you, in particular in comparison to Little Jim's trailer. 

I'm currently in discussions with a trailer maker in my area about dimensions and outfitting of a custom-made trailer, in particular concerning the launch angle and bed-length required to get the Paradox afloat, and the optimal recovery angle to get the boat back on the trailer.
