Subject: Re: Charcoal Heater

I mostly listen in here, which is not being very active....and I'm here under false colours anyway, since I didn't build my Paradox but bought it used.

I used the little stove recently while on an 18 day cruise. One of the days was very wet, windy and chilly, so stayed at anchor in a sheltered river. It does make a difference to comfort when the weather's damp and chilly.

Best
