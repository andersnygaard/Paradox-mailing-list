Hello Dave,

Thanks for your response. I'm not surprised that your wrist ached after 7 hours hard sculling - I'm sure that would happen to everyone.

I've slightly increased the bend on my yuloh which is the original one made by Bill Sarjeant when he built 'Faith'. I don't know exactly how it will work out yet as I've not had a chance to use my boat this year but hope to launch for a trip in March if the constant rain and gales ever stop. That will be the first trip with my new sail too and some other minor alterations and improvements that I've made, so will have some other new things to try and results to digest. I'll report back afterwards with my impressions.

Best,
Jim in wet and windy England
