Subject: 4 sided sprit rig

I wish James was still with us as I would have liked to share my experiences using my 4 sided sprit rig with him. I'm going to create a video and post measurements on how to make the sail, but in short, it has solved a number of issues I had with the standing lug.

Here's a precis of what I've found:

1. Much better performance on all points of sail, but particularly potent upwind in light air.
2. Boat now tacks reliably in all conditions.
3. Gybing is a non-issue.
4. Still able to store spars inside boat, mast, sprit and boom all measure 4m.
5. Lines can be left permanently set up in vent box.
6. All line loads are very light compared to the standing lug including the sheet.
7. The spars when stored on the side of the boat do not stick out far behind it.
8. Sail plan is balanced with a similar CoE to the standing lug.

Downsides:

1. Reefing doesn't really exist. There are just three states, full rig, scandalised and struck. This could be a problem if you were venturing into open water, but if you mainly sail in sheltered waters like me, scandalising the rig will be enough to allow you to run downwind into shelter.
2. Rather than two lines, I now have four to play with and there is a lot more line in the cabin than there used to be.

A proper report will follow in due course, but in short, the sprit rig is everything I hoped it would be.

Cheers,

Rob.
