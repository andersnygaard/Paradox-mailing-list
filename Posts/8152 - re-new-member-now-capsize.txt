Hi Paradoxers,

I am very slowly building the Paradox Planktos in Perth Western Australia.  I contacted Geoff Davis quite a few years ago through this group.  Geoff has told me about the capsize.  I will leave it to him to tell the story.  What I know is that he did recover the boat and fixed a hole in the side of the hull and made a new mast.  Since then he has done many long trips including to Abrolhos Islands and back to Perth (2013) and then to Shark Bay (2014).  Both of these were very substantial journeys along a pretty wild coast.  The boat has performed well.  Geoff has sailed with me on my Vertue (Yacabba) which I have since sold.  Geoff has only good things to say about the Paradox design.  In short, it has most of the attributes of a Vertue but on a smaller scale.  

Regards
