I have done this many times on boats. The way that I enjoy doing it is buy building a pedal generator and having it either charge a battery or turn the motor. This is the easiest way to do but maybe not the lightest. There are advantages either way. Using the electrical system allows you set your motor to a lower output than you are pedaling so you can "coast" on stored power. Robb
