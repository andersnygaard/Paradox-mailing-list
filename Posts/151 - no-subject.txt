I have a few questions about the Paradox. Most of what i know about this boat is what i have read in these discussion groups. 

- Does anyone know how big/small the thing actualy is? - I am refering to when you are sitting inside it, how confortable/much space is there. It would seem like if i had to be stuck inside a small room all day with the roof shut, i would want to be comfortable.

- The cabin seems cramped for one person, so can it accomidate two? - crusing or day sailing?

- When you make your way forward, how much space is there? I am not clostrophobic but is it safe to crawl through those small hatches to access the front stowage - you would have to come back out backwards so it may be difficult to do so in a hurry.

- Is she seaworthy/safe?

- What if you wanted to go on deck / reef the sail?

- What if i just want to sit on deck with my friends and a fishing rod - is this safe? The boat is only 4' wide afterall.

Thanks.

Kevin
