Subject: Re: Considering Dingos and Modifying Paradox

Hi 

Paradox Max,seems a good name!!
Does that 16ft include the cruvature of the plywood so would be 
approx 15ft9? 
Also what would implications of making beam 4ft at chine? and 5ft at 
deck leave so to make the boat more comfortable to 2 users? 
Also quick arathmetic shows that 2 liter pop bottles give approx 125 
Kgs over an 3ft x 6ft area, so would useful weight. 
The enigma 460 is about the righ size but very narrow on the beam. 
Making her beamer -5ft and taking the deck house to full width would 
improve living conditions.

P.s. I am sure I am a dingo! but I would never have put that deck 
house on that hartley ferro hull, which incidentaly got me into 
sailing, on sea tramp moored in hamble, last time I was there. Is she 
still there. 
Which got me into indoor sailing, drinking cups of tea from the deck 
saloon, which is rather simalar to paradox except for scale!
