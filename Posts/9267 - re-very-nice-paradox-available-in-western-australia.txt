Hello Gary,

I sent a text to your phone number, but an alternative is to mail my yahoo email which is just my handle for this forum... i.e. geoffdavis67 and then the usual, at 'yahoo.com.au'.

Meanwhile, I've been meaning to add an interior picture and have hesitated because all I have are taken while out cruising with the cabin in disarray... if I had thought I would publish such pictures I would have made my bed and washed the dishes. Nevertheless, if you can overlook such things, the attached gives an idea of the interior looking forward.

Small Fry, Fremantle.
