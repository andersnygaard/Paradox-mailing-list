That=E2=80=99s a sensible idea. If you have the plans all you need to mock up is the sleeping position (ie distance between bulkheads) and the height from floor to top of cockpit sliding hatch when closed.

Most of the time the hatch will be open so head room will be fine. Only need to worry about headroom when hatch is closed.

I sleep on my sided with knees bent and no problem.
