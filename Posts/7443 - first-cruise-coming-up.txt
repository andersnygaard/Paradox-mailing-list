Subject: First cruise coming up


Hi everyone,

I'm excited. On May 3rd I will be picking up =ABIronsides=BB and going for a two-week live-aboard shake-down cruise in South Puget Sound, starting from Olympia, Washington.

I have read about half of the nearly 7,000 messages on this forum, and feel more and more fortunate (and somewhat shameful) at having obtained a Paradox without having been obliged to build it. (Thanks Steve!)

My only prior sailing experience is two summers with a Siren 17 on the Saguenay fjord (with important tides) and a dozen day tours sailing with buddies in larger sloops. However, I am a professional outdoor guide (professor of outdoor adventure at the University of Qu=E9bec), so the camping aspects and orientation are second nature. I also completed two sailing navigation courses with Canadian Power and Sails Squadrons here in Qu=E9bec, and my radio certification.

I sure would appreciate any advice you guys might have to help a beginner prepare for his first trip. I wish to go yuloh only. You should know that where I have sailed in the past there have been no other boats to deal with, so meeting tons of other boats concern me, even if I'm aware of the rules of the road.

My questions:

How can I get in trouble? Worst-case scenarios?

Suggestions on how to anchor for sleeping?

Essential safety gear to carry, other than my SPOT and VHF radio?

VHF channels to use in south Puget Sound?

What to expect during my first moments aboard?

In advance, thanks!
