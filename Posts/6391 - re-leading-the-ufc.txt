Nels,
Thanks for the update. He lost about 40+ miles advantage since yesterday.
Lets see if he gains some back. Anyone that finished wins, in my book. Two days or two minutes don't mean nothing. They are all heros to me.

Wizard is only about 10 miles ahead of Manitou Cruiser and Whitecaps this evening. Wiz took a rest and seems to be moving again, (2.43 knots)
while MC is resting and WC is really moving (4.23 knots!)

Somebody posted that Pelican started going again without a mast.Paddling and peddling. What a competitor!
Will be interesting so see if Wizard goes outside tomorrow as he has an opening coming up in about 20 miles.

To my mind he is not feeling pressed to stay in the lead. He stays
within his own personal plan and limits and choices, and has a great deal of respect for the other challengers. Very inspirational.
No wonder he garners so much respect!
