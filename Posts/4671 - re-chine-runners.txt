Hi John,

That's what I was thinking of when I suggested that the bottom
sheet be extended out beyond the sides, perhaps taking a fair curve, 
which would form the bottom surface of the chine runners. The foam could 
then be laminated straight to the top of that "shelf" as Jack described
it.

The plans already call for the bottom sheet to be wider than the 
sides.

Hoping for calm nights,

Al
Yeovil, England.
