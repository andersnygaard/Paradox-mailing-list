Subject: The Bottom of Enuf

Got started on the bottom today and things went well; at first.
I positioned the left over from bulkhead cutting piece on the upturned front of the boat, 
used four wire nails to locate it (ala Al Law), marked it up and trimmed it to shape. 
I made a larger base for my router from a piece of polycarbonate and cut the lap joint on 
the back edge of the forward part of the bottom. (still with me?) Because I had a spare 
piece of 12mm ply to hand I trimmed the 18mm down to 6mm and then offered up the 
last 18mm sheet for marking. 
I lined it up, glanced towards the back of the boat and realised, to my horror, that there 
was a 6" gap :0(  I felt distinctly sick! Who forgot measure twice and cut once, then? 
Because I'd fiddled about to get the joint under the second bulkhead I'd moved the bottom 
piece too far forwards without thinking about the consequences. 
Time for a rest me thinks.
