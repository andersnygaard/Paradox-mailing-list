This has been discussing the building of the larger 28 foot Paradox that was talked about earlier and in the course of doing so, comparisons have been made with Bolgers boats as well as my mentioning Glen-L and other sites.

There has been some interest and discussion about making a full size 28-30 ft Paradox and how to retain all the features inherent in the standard version and whether that is feasible or even possible.

you can read the file about making the Larger Paradox in the Group Files section.

I thought this was a meeting place for the exchange of information relative to the buiding, owning, maintaining and sailing of the Paradox! Don't the builers of Bolgers boats have there owne Group?
