Subject: Mast weight?

Hi guys,

I'm a long time lurker here on this sight and the microcruising site and I have a few questions for you.

I have a set of plans and the build book from Don Elliot and I can't find a estimate of the weight of the mast when it is completed.

I know a lot depends on the wood that it is made from(that's another question)but a rough guess would be helpful.

I am curious as to why someone has not used an aluminum spar instead of making one from wood?

I am thinking about building a Paradox and all help and advice is needed!

Thanks in advance,
