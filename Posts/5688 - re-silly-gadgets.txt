This claims a 60 watt output when foot driven. At 12 volts that's 5 amps. 

I have a small Minn Kota outboard that, on the most efficient setting, pushes Little Jim at 2 knots while consuming 15 amps. So you need to pedal 3 hours for every hour of motoring. (On the higher speed setting it does 3 knots for 30 amps.)

If I was spending more on the system I think I would settle for a *big* solar panel and/or wind generator and a *big* battery bank.

As it is I charge the 80AH battery before setting off and only use the motor in extreme need.

Hoping for calm nights
