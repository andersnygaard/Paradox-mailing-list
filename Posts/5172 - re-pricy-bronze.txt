Hi Folks,

My enquiry really was centred around why barbed ring nail instead of screws?  It 's the mechanical merits I'm asking about rather than the corrosion resistance of different metals.

Would seem to me that wood screws have advantages: that you can take them out without damage to dismantle something might be a handy attribute. I would imagine that trying to pull out a barbed nail is likely to cause some co-lateral damage.

Even with the screws removed there would be significant damage if trying to dismantle as all joints are well glued, and you would have to remove the glass sheathing to get at the screws in the first place. If you want to remove ring nails the easiest (only?) way is to grind off the head, separate the joint and cut the nail off flush.

Nails are cheaper, quicker and more satisfying to install.

Hoping for calm nights.
