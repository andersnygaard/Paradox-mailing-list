Good point, Sighting the Vasa. She went turtle and became a submarine.
I have thought about a bigger paradox but, I thought why mess with a 
good thing. And if I may add, it would be easer to lead a nomadic 
life with the original size boat, Having to tow it around.  Anyway 
good luck with you project. 

Good sailing.
