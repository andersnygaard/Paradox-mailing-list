Subject: Happy New Year...short video celebrating Micro and Pocket cruisers...

We may be a little bit of the "outsiders" when hanging around the big guys at the marina....but that doesn't stop us from having fun! Caution! This video intended to be played with the volume cranked up and on a day when you feel a bit ROWDY!! If a loud raucous look at sailing is not your favorite thing...this video is not for you. :-)

Click the link below to be taken to the youtube clip......and hang on! :-) (don't forget to turn the resolution up to 1080 if your connection can handle it)

Happy New Year Gang!!
