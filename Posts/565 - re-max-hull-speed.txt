Have fun David! An idea I got from Stock's book, "Sailing just for Fun" was to use a small inter tube for a seat cushion. I picked one up at home depot, a 4X6, and once inflated it is a pleasure indeed to sit on. On my trips it has been by butt that gives the most complaint from sitting all day on that plank. Even two 1" dense rubber cushions would soon become uncomfortable. Let us know how your trip goes. Still looking forward to getting together some place.

Hi All,

the normal numbers would be 1.3 times the square root of the waterline length or 1.3 X 3.663 =3D 4.76 kts (5.4 mph). It is not unusual for sharpies to sail much faster. On my trip to Clearwater while broad reaching about 6 miles offshore in winds of 12- 15 kts and seas 2-3 ft under full sail I saw GPS readings of 5.9 - 6.1 kts for about two hours until the wind died down, the GPS recorded a max speed for that leg of 6.3 kts. At one point I hardened up on the wind to see what she would do while smashing into the seas and the best I could do was 4.7 kts. All and all not to shabby for a 13'5" water line length.
