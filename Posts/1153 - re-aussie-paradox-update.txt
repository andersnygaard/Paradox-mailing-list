It looks like you are making great progress on your Paradox, and I enjoyed the photograph of the two of you "sleeping" aboard your boat. The picture reminded me of how "snug" it can be when you are resting side by side in a tiny boat.

Oftentimes, when we want a little more elbow room on Little Cruiser, Mindy and I sleep head to foot. Just as long as one of you doesn't have stinky feet, this works really well. We have also tried sleeping on our sides which is fine too except that the arm underneath sometimes "falls asleep."  Overall, though, we are pretty comfortable just as long as our foam mattress is nice and thick. 

Unfortunately, we've been using the same one for most of our trips, and it's getting a little thin now. Probably, for our next voyage we'll get some new foam.
