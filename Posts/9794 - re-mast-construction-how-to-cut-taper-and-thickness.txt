Hi Paul,

I own Don's paradox now, and I know he must have done a great job building the mast as it has worked well. I repainted the mast when I first purchased the boat.

The best way to get the building paradox manual written by Don is through his son's website. Wanda Elliott is no longer selling direct by old fashion mail.
Please use the link below for more information. Based on my experience on Don's build, I recommend his method as per his manual:
