So far it has been my experience, in light air any way, that she will sail herself with a little tweaking of the tiller ropes. The helm seems content to stay where you put it, probably due to the friction in the tiller rope setup. On my last overnighter I was able to move around inside and fix myself a sandwich & mix a drink without her changing course much if any.
