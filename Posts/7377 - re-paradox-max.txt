Subject: Re: Paradox Max

Gunther, the person gives advice once. Being crazy is not the same as being foolish. For this, there is no need to ask in a forum and disregard knowledge of experienced people. I know that this is the error, another member of the forum said based on long journeys and also know, as I said, every kind of person who confuses stubbornness with determination. Make your boat the way you think best, the money is yours and that you will have to face the results of that. Honestly, it would be better to identify a larger project. Good luck

Hello
I understand your mind. Of course, bigger is not always better but who wants to spend a long time on this little boat should at least have the size of Little Cruiser. It is supposed to go even further away (across the Atlantic, others take the pedalo or rowing boat over then it will create a paradox but easier), have just an optimist (dreamer?) but a very persistent. Here is a link to my swimming pond project http://www.teichbau-forum-naturagart.de/index.php/forum/5-bautechnik-grube-ausheben/4407-neulings-teichprojekt because you can see how crazy I really am. I know I can do it. Size of the boat here, it may not actually be so many problems otherwise there is also no Little Cruiser. I need anything bigger I do realize. Actually, I wanted to build a Cat, Jarcat 6 but for this money I can build at least 3-4 paradox. And then the more work with such a boat. As I look better in the world and much earlier than with a Cat. Do you understand now.
Bye
