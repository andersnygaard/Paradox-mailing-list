Subject: Hey Alaistar (and others). What did you use to thicken your epoxy and how is going after all these years?

Hi Alaistar,

I remember reading a message by you saying something about this. YEARS ago. How you thickened your epoxy for fillets in an unconventional way. Sawdust perhaps? Was it sometype of flour? Talc? I dont remember and yahoo doesnt offer a search function on messages.

Everyone else, I am also curious about what you all think also. I am looking at microspheres and thinking about doing something else.

Thank you.
