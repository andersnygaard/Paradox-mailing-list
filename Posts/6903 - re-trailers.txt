Hi Bill
A really soft beach would be a major challenge. ....That gloopy mud that we get in Poole Harbour is far too soft to walk on. The only thing that you could use to recover your boat on it would be a helicopter ......and I don't propose to build one of them.

As for making a small fortune , I'd find that easy , so long as I started with a large fortune first.

Good luck with your new boat, Bill.
