Actually the Robbsboat IS ballasted with @ 200lbs.  I used a pari of deep cycle batteries for @ 86lbs and did the rest as bolted on steel plates to the bulkheads as Jim shows in the plans.  Most of the Ballast needs to go forward unless you=92re going to shove a bunch of stuff in the forward storage.  I put in rope steering to keep my weight forward when sailing solo to get her to trim properly for day sailing without the aforementioned crap loaded up front.

I think the big difference with regards to the chine runners is that Matt=92s boats have a flatter run at the bow and keep it in the water.  Jim has the Bolger Sharpie curvature the keeps the bow out of the water and thus more rocker.  I considered doing chine runners, but figured I=92d go with the proven leeboard as I need to tack a lot where I sail.  I believe the paradox is set up to track straight for long periods, not constantly pivot.
