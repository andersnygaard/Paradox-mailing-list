Subject: Re: Another UK Paradox!

Hello all,

Thought it was time I came out of the North London woodwork! Yes, another UK bloke wants to build this fine little craft.

I have the much-fingered plans; I have spent many hours absorbing your messages and gained much useful info, for which many thanks; I have a garage filled to the brim with junk; I have a shed filled to the brim with junk, I have tools. Wifey expects construction of a glass cabinet for her china to commence shortly - what better time then but to start immediately on building a Paradox? 

We are gathering quotes on plywood as I write. (I may have to buy sapele faced ply in order to pretend it's for her furniture...)

Expect the usual 'what does this mean' questions...

Yours, rather excitedly on finally making a start,
Ian L.

Thank you, Bill, your most kind. Will take you up on your offer at some point, no doubt. Good luck with the launch - hope you have a bottle of bubbly for breaking over the bow.
Ian L.
