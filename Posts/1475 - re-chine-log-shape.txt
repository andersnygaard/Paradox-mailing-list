Bingo. Same with the sheer clamp. If you look at the "chine log, stbd quarter" photo in the Swash album, perhaps you will see the trianglar section which needs to be faired into the transom.

Clarity becomes more evident, as you proceed. I tend to agree with Al's recommendation to just do it. You will find that the building process is fairly intuitive.
