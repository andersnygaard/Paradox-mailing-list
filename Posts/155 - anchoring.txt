Matt just throws his off the stern, and when the boat has stopped moving walks forward and ties the line to the bow cleat. When not in use, the anchor is stowed in a bucket in the stern. We've done this on Little Cruiser and it works fine. Of course you could lead the end of your anchor line forward and keep the anchor, chain and rest of the line in the boat. Incidently, when we first got Little Cruiser, our Bruce anchor actually hung off the stern, where Matt deployed it when needed. There may be something to this.
