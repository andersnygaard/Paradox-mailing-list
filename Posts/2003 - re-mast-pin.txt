Subject: Re: Mast Pin?

There isn't a mast pin in Paradox, but there is in Little Cruiser whose mast is supported on the foredeck with the aid of two hinged "struts". When we want to lower the mast aboard LC, all we do is pull a pin at the foot of the mast, and it folds backwards until it is sitting on the cabin top.

The mast partners, fastened to the deck, hold it up. To lower the 
mast simply lift it up (about 600mm) and it is free. It will lie 
down on top of the rolled up sail/boom.

I believe Little Cruiser's mast folds down.

Where in Don's articles?

In Don's articles it says that you can pull out a pin and lower the mast. After looking at construction photos it seems that most people aren't including this pin? Is this correct? And the mast tilts forward or back? 

(As a side note what I was referring to as canted masts before is really raked masts)
