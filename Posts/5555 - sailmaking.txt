Subject: Sailmaking

I'm in the middle of sailmaking right now. It is pleasent work. I have 
put up two photos in the Ironsides album of my setup for long seams. I 
roll up the cloth around tubes and secure it with tape. Steering the 
seam and cloth thru the machine is challenging as it is so clumsy and 
heavey. The cloth is resistant to the needle so I must go fast for the 
motor/flywheel to have enough power and enertia. The luff has extra 
cloth tape edging to resist the tension developed there. I'm glad I 
found those Sailrite instructional videos on YouTube. There are some 
very usefull tricks there.
