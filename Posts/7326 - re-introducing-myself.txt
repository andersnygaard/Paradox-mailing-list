Subject: Introducing myself

Hi all,

My name is Andr=C3=A9-Fran=C3=A7ois Bourbeau, and I have been lucky enough to have purchased Steve Yahn's Paradox =C2=ABIronsides=C2=BB. I've been lurking on this forum for over two years, but couldn't gather up enough courage to build my own boat (although I was getting close). So when Steve put his beautifully constructed craft up for sale, I couldn't resist, even though it was over 5000 km from my house here in northern Qu=C3=A9bec, Canada. Having just retired, I figured I could either leave it out west and go sailing there, or eventually take a cross-America tour and bring it home.

A bit about me. I'm professor emeritus at the University of Qu=C3=A9bec, having worked all my career in the outdoors field, teaching adventure tourism and doing research in wilderness survival and outdoor risk management. So I'm at ease in the outdoors, having done a great many long canoe-camping trips and such. As far as sailing is concerned though, I'm nearly a complete beginner. I've owned a Siren 17 microcruiser for a couple of years and have taken two theory courses. I've sailed a bit on my Siren and also on some bigger boats with some friends. And read a lot of sailing adventures. That's it.

I'm handy with my hands, having constructed my own home, and having built some birchbark canoes. But as far as the Paradox goes, I will no doubt need to consult with some of you for hints and tips. In advance, thanks.

Can't wait to go meet Ironsides, patiently waiting for me at Steve's house. As soon as the weather warms up a bit, this will happen.

Hope to meet some of you one of these days, and who knows, maybe go sailing together!

May your winds blow from a happy direction.

Andr=C3=A9-Fran=C3=A7ois

PS My kind thanks to Steve, who has been a real gentleman and so very helpful.
