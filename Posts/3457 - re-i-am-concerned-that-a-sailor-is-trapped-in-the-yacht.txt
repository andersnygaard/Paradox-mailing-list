I am not sure if you are expecting a reply from me or somebody else.

The Paradox doesn't have a keel but it does carry a lot of weight low down. It is supposed to self right and in Al Law's experience it does. 

I don't know that I would trust any lid to be water tight but the vessel will hold air pockets and it has built in buoyancy. My own version of Paradox is likely to have a fabric roll top. I think that I have the final design in my head now.

Assuming that it is the right way up and floating with the deck level with the water why not just sit there with head and shoulders above the water, and wait? Rescue services say to stay with the boat; it is easier to spot than a man in the water.
James Bullimore famously 'sat it out' in an air pocket in an upturned catamaran in the open ocean and was rescued after several days.

We all, no doubt, have different reactions to danger . I know that for me if it happens instantly (sudden loss of lift in a microlight) then I panic. If time allows, I get control and resolve the situation. Obviously, so far in life, I've had time :0) 
If the problem occurs slowly I deal with it as it happens without panicking (drowning) but get very angry and use the anger to keep focus. I would hope that is what would happen in a boating accident. As I've said, the priority is to stay with the boat.

Of course, this is pure speculation based on odd bits of experience. My preferred scenario is for Superman to pluck me from the water and save my boat, and then deliver me to Meg Ryan for resuscitation, or not getting myself into the situation at all.
