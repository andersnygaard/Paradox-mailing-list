Jeff-
After twenty-five years in Southeast Alaska-most of it living on my sailboat year 'round, I've found that it doesn't take much to heat a cabin the size of Paradox's. Sometimes only a regular kerosene lamp puts out enough heat to be comfortable. Two lamps are better. My husband made a small wood-burning heater out of a section of six-inch steel pipe (NOT galvanized!) with both ends welded shut and a small door cut into the side with only a drill and a jig saw with a metal-cutting blade. A door was cut out of another piece of six-inch pipe that fit over the hole and used regular hinges from the hardware store. About four holes were drilled near the bottom of the pipe for giving air to the fire. Three-inch stove pipe was used for the stack and a two-foot section was attached when at anchor. We didn't normally use the stove when underway, we just had the pipe capped where it came through the cabin top.
I wouldn't use charcoal just because of the smell and the dangerous fumes. The hatch should be cracked open about an inch when any stove is used.
