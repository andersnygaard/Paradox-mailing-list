It's fine now, Thanks :)

I don't want to start a thread when you are so busy, Bill. But is there any chance you might do Holy Island (near my home) with your Paradox next year?

(Derek, if you are reading. I will answer your excellent letter, soonest ;)

Hi Tony,

I'm pleased you like the site.

If, with mindfulness' rope,
The elephant of the mind is tethered all around,
Our fears will come to nothing, 
Every virtue drop into our hands.
