The moderator should be able to put you right here. New tools enable moderators to allow members free access to upload and download their own files/pictures; they can set the web tool to only allow a limited number of people access; or they can prevent all doing it except themselves; or moderators can turn off access altogether. There is another alternative, that's the moderator can approve photos and only these will be permissible.

At my smallsailboats group the situation I'm currently operating is to allow access to all members to upload and delete their pictures.

Hope this helps; but as I say, get ask this group's moderator to explain what's happening here.

Bill.
