Being a paddler myself - I am always amazed at the amount of "carry" scullers get with their long skinny hulls which are built as lightly as possible. So intuitively, I feel that Paradox would not scull very well despite its weight and momentum. It would feel like you were pushing too much water and then decelerating quickly.

But I am getting into an area here were I have no experience. Seems a yuloh is the perfect solution from my point of view. Now my question is - should one carry a spare yuloh? Perhaps a two-piece one stowed inside in case the main one gets stolen or breaks? A spare paddle is required in canoeing. 

I always carry two if I am paddling with a partner. A pair of lightweight bent shafts and a pair for whitewater. The only paddles I have ever lost - were stolen when in "civilization". One was a 6 oz "Black Bart" that cost me $160. Ouch!!

Are plans for the yuloh available with Paradox plans now - does anyone know? Are they copywritten too?
