Subject: Re: sail plan

I am seriously considering building the 20% larger Paradox.

According to the Larger Paradox file this would entail a sail
60% larger, or 160 sq ft.

A sail this size in the current configuration would seem to be pretty
cumbersome....although I may be wrong about this.

Yes, I would think at the very least you would have to use some
mechanical advantage to be able to raise it, which would mean a whole
lot more halyard to store somewhere if you were to do it with blocks at either 2:1 or 3:1.
Cheers,

Would it be blasphemy to consider an alternate sail plan....such as
a cat yawl or similar? (like a bolger micro)

It seems like it would be a more efficient rig...although it would have
complications such locations of spars, size of sails, how to operate from below, etc.

Hope I am not too far off asking this question....and wonder if anyone
else has considered altering the sail plan?
