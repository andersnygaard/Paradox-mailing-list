Hi David,

I'm a Diver also, I have gear aboard my Paradox a lot, it's a little cramped and can't see it happening on long trips with 4 tanks. Have you thought of any neat ways of storing Dive aboard?

Regards,
John

Hi John, 

I have thought a lot about it a lot and haven't really come up with much, no free lunch here. I wish I could afford a Brownie 3rd Lung, as we are very limited in space dept. I'll bet a 19-foot Paradox would be sweet for storing tanks in the floor. Do you spend most of your time in fresh water or salt? The reason I ask is rinsing gear is important, the water tanks come in handy for this. Also, I have a 9-foot Achilles inflatable I could tow along behind for a dive tender, but I wouldn't want that attached to me if it gets rough. In protected waters, this really wouldn't be a problem. I just don't like the idea of sitting on top of 3000 psi missiles when it gets rough. I find enough lost weight belts to use the straps to lock the tanks down, and since I have yet to install the bin sides, I will have to go do a little fitting and see how I could stow the tanks in that location.

Regards, 
Jack
