Rather than rush to go three dimensional, I decided than another coat of epoxy on the bulkheads would be a good idea. 

While I was in the middle of a cure cycle, I decided to mill out my chine logs. Damn, these suckers are really huge! I'm using Honduras Mahogany (throughout the boat), which admittedly isn't near as bendy as white oak. Damn, these suckers are !really huge! I can understand Al's frustration when he was trying to install his. 

I've milled the chine logs to the plan dimensions, though I may well resaw and laminate them if they prove as stubborn as they appear now. It's really hard to say though; perhaps they'll spring right in. After all, the boat is quite narrow.

The plan after the sides are fastened to the bulkheads, and the chine logs and sheer clamps are in, is to make a trip down to Home Depot, where I can find the Johns Manville, foil faced foam. Still pondering the best route for the insulation. I won't worry too much about the ability to inspect behind the foam, so I'll likely glue the stuff in. I don't like the idea of exposed foam, even if it's foam faced and painted. I feel more comfortable with a veneer of some sort. Just so long as it's lightweight; maybe 3mm okoume. Essentially, this would be the same solution that Glen was talking about, except that everything would be glued in.
