Hi All,

It looked like the Ply on the bottom soaked up a lot of water, So 
I ground off all the glass, and while it was still wet brushed it with 
anti-freeze. Im going to let it dry for a couple of weeks with fans 
and heat lamps before I lay the roving. I think Im on the right track.

Im looking for a cheap source for Bronze, rod stock and sch 40 
pipe. West Marine has it, but its not cheap!

On the lower rudder fitting Im thinking of having it machined out 
of Nylon, I have a cheap source (Free), and access to a machine shop. 
I can get it up to 6" thick. If I make it to Matt's print do think it 
will be strong enough? If it will work I can have a few made if 
anybody is intrested? We can hold about a .000050 tol.
