Subject: Tips for pulling yourself up on a line while swimming

We tested this a lot too, the secret is to lay ON YOUR BACK while pulling on the rope above you. That way, no water in your face and more tendency to lift rather than dive, plus the arm muscles used are stronger because your wrists are straight.

Nothing like testing things to find out if they work. Then in a crunch, less surprises.

Have a nice day folks.
