Matt has posted pictures of his latest creation, a 9' x 38" cruiser for the Ultimate Florida Challenge.

The new boat looks alot like a Paradox/Enigma 460 with long chine runners,a wide stern and long rudder blade. My guess it will have excellent directional stability. The boat is being tested with Sand Fleas' sail, but I think Matt said he is making a new sail which will use a roller furling drum. I guess it will also use a spray skirt instead of a hatch. All in all, another very pretty design.
