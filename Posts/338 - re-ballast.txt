Does anyone know where the centre of gravity of Paradox should be? I have not been able to find it on the plans, is this another one I am just not seeing?

Hi All,
Im goining to try a 4 hp 4 stroke @ 65lbs on my Paradox. It is a bit heavy for her, I believe. Going to try it anyway since I have a new one. Any suggestions on how to move my ballast around to to make up for the extra weight? I have 400lbs in 25 lbs blocks between bulkheads #2 and #3 with most of it shifted close to blh #3.Im not sure I have her ballested right to begin with.She doesnt want to tack or sail to windward.
