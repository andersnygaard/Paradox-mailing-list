Thanks Jack

Unfortunately I didn't get an attachment with the emails

I've been keeping a lookout for brass tube at the two non ferrous scrap yards but it is all thin wall and tends to be in short lengths. I guess the factories are more careful about their non ferrous waste than their ferrous waste.

Epoxy seems the way to go to get a strong piece of tube at minimal cost.
