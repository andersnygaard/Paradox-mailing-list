Perhaps those who have sailed a Paradox can speak to this, but it seems to me that in so confined quarters, and in so small a boat, you may not want to be too close to the windows. Every little lurch of the boat may threaten to smack your head against the side of the trunk cabin. Especially if there are two persons shoe-horned into the cabin. But I'd be happy to be corrected. I've never sailed in a microcruiser.

I have thought a lot about this and had designed several unbuilt hulls that had a more Birdwatcher-like cabin. My concern is that the farther a glazed opening is from your position the less you can see out of it and the more healing and wave motion will further limit what you can see. If the ports are near just moving ones head a bit can alter the view considerably.
