To my knowledge there are only four under sail, those are Matt's, Don Elliott's, David Beard's and mine. Those building are David Beard, Al in England, C. I. Becker in Australia, and Jeff Forest. Any one else out there, please stand up and be counted. 

I live 30 miles west of Jacksonville Fl and extend an open invitation to any one interested to stop by and inspect mine. I would also be willing to take seriously interested individuals for a sail provided we could both get in, petite young ladies should not be a problem in that regard. 

Anyone interested please e-mail me at ifida@nefcom.net to arrange a time slot. My sea trials went very well and I am trying to put together a summary to post as well as get some more pictures in the album.
