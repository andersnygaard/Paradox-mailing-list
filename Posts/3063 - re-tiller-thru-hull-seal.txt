Hi David,

I did the same with rubber membrane roofing .065 for same reasons, bugs and varmits while on the trailer. Yesterday we were going out, we stopped and got a 12 vt fan and mounted her in the vent trunk, it worked great!! temps were near 100 here yesterday and it made it at least bearable for the person up front. now we are planning to epoxy the fan into the rim of a acces hatch so we can mount it and remove it when the boat is stored, I just remove the fan and replace with another rim and place the cover on and no bugs from the vent trunk.

Jack
