To my amazement the tablesaw jig I made to cut the laminations for the deck beams had them 25x45mm spot on (first time ever using a table saw)

The first laminated beam is almost ready to be removed from its jig. When I assembled it yesterday I had everything orchestrated to the “T” but after mixing the epoxy I put on my nitrale gloves and they tore due to dry-rot despite being in a 10+ year old? Unopened box. I put the beams together bare-handed and highly suggest NOT doing that. I itched all night long. As with most things the second time should go better.

Today while waiting for the deck-beam to dry I made a curved template out of 6mm ply in order to trace it onto the other ply sheets for cutting out bulkheads. Back to the workshop!
