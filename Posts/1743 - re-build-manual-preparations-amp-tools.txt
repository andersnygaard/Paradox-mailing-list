Subject: Re: Build Manual, Preparations &amp; Tools

This is always good advice for the tradesman, and for hobbyist if they intend to carry on building. If, however, you are building your one boat/bookshelves from necessity then start with what you have and buy what you find you need, as you need it.

I am one of those tool whores that somebody mentioned earlier because I buy tools that I think I might use one day. In the years when I couldn't afford to indulge myself I started with 3 saws, 3 chisels, a brace, a hand drill, a number 4 plane, a combination square and various pencils and rules. My first power tool was a B&amp;D drill and a stand which made a perfectly adequate pillar drill for wood work.

Fine tools are a delight to own and use, but they are not necessary to build one (ply)wood boat. Power tools will save time but will also remove more of your flesh in the event of a mistake. My wood working is infrequent enough that I never felt safe with my radial arm saw or planer/thicknesser. I sold them and enjoy my hand tools instead.

I hope that this helps anybody who feels daunted by the tool list. It is not a criticism of that list. If you have a minimum tool kit I'd say start with the timber and then buy some tools to suit what you are going to do first. The price of ply is daunting enough.
