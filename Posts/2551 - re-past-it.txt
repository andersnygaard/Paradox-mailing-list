Subject: Re: past it ??

I'm intending to start building a Paradox later this year and I'm over 70.

It seems to me, one does not need super fitness or agility to sail a Paradox, and as Dave has so well explained, there are many advantages of owning a small uncomplicated shallow draught cruiser, but I would add that Paradox is not only an excellent fine weather coastal cruiser for one person, but she is a very good trailer sailor. That's a great feature for UK sailors because they have so many launching sites giving access to various types of cruising waters within a relatively short distance from where they live. For me, in southeast England, it's only a mere 600 miles to Inverness in northern Scotland and a further 60 miles to beautiful Ullapool. Other wonderful places such as Falmouth in southwest England and Milford Haven in southwest Wales are all closer.

In capable hands, Paradox could easily be sailed across the English Channel or to the Scilly Isles from Falmouth. Perhaps less demanding would be an exploration of the Broads.

If one is prepared to pay the high costs of using ferries, Ireland has many fine cruising waters, particularly in the southwest between Baltimore, Dingle, and the River Shannon. Even the French Morbihan and the northern Bay of Biscay Islands are all within easy reach by road and ferry. There are also those super inland Dutch lakes such as the Ijsselmeer and those in the southern Delta Region around Middelburg.

Those preferring non-tidal UK waters have a wide choice from lakes, lochs, rivers, and canals.

Here is a page of links to UK cruising waters

A good many of these cruising grounds are within the capabilities of Paradox, providing her skipper is competent.

For those in the UK contemplating building a Paradox I would suggest they contact Alec Jordan of Jordan Boats:

for information about his kit version of the little boat. (There's a contact link at his web site.) As I understand it, there is also a prospective kit manufacturer of Paradox in the US, but please ask Alec about that. He's certainly looking for manufacturers of the kit under licence in the US because it's there the boat has the greatest following.
