Subject: A few questions.

I have the following queries.

1.
I've positioned the intermediate deck beam between Bulkheads 1&amp;2 but have found that the deck beam on Bkhd 1 is slightly low. I seem to recall seeing some photos of someone elses build with this beam built up slightly. Is this a common problem or have i measured something wrong?
Looks like I'll have to add a strip of 9mm ply or similar, the top of the stem also looks like it will need a few mm knocked off!

2.
on the Cabin details sheet 10, there is an exploded view of the Corner Post detail. I have looked at this from every angle and can still not understand what it is trying to show. Is it a plan view or elevation? What part of the post do the two angles refer too (30=BA &amp; 14=BA).

3.
What internal paint available in the UK do you recommend for internal finish? Porch paint and the like mean nothing to me! Would a good oil based gloss paint be OK over sanded epoxy coating? I've also been wondering whether to apply non slip to the cabin sole. I think it would be a good idea, in that it would provide a better footing, however as I like to wear shorts, it probably wouldn't be too kind on my knees.

Other than that things are progressing steadily.

Regards

Pete
