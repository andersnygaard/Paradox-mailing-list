On drawing 7#, bulkhead 2 has the curve dimensions for the master beam crop. This curve is common to all bulkheads. I would normally make a beam crop which would be used on all the bulkheads but as there are only four and the boat is small, I will mark out 2# and use that as my crop. It's just a simple matter of laying the cut out bulkhead 2 onto the plywood with the main dimensions drawn (bulkheads 1, 4 and the transom), lining up the centre lines and the deck marks and scribe. Simple and quick.
