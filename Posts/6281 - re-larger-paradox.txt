Subject: Re: larger paradox

I would like to add that enlarging any design takes away from its versatility and convenience. You need more building space. Heavier to trailer and launch and retreive. Maybe a more expensive motor and more costly sail. The cost and weight goes up exponentially.

With the Paradox sail plan - you end up with a big roll of sail on the boom when reefed down. That would have to taken into account as well in my view.
