Subject: Possible Chine Runner analogy, improvement

You know another thing I was thinking about was Sven's and other people explanations of the chine runners.  When I was first reading about them I really wasn't understanding what they were, and made the mistake of thinking that they were facing down instead of out. I more of the attitude that it was great that a person could get away with not having a dagger board running in to things.  It also seemed more elegant that they were out on the sides, because sometimes it has felt like the dagger board is contributing in tipping the boat over.

I still really don't understand how they work within a hydrodynamic model, but once I realize that they were actually jetting out, they reminded me of my snowboard edges and a discussion I had with my cousin about the new edges they've developed. I will have to read up on this, but I wonder if this analogy could benefit chine runner design. If they act similarly then one would see similar edge ware, which would be focused somewhere near the very fore and aft edges. If this was the case, then after reading more about the important points of the new ski edges, one could possibly design more efficient chine runners. Offhand each chine runner would look like a very long subtle mirrored half of an hourglass. 

Anyway, enough wild speculation for one day. Check your edges.
