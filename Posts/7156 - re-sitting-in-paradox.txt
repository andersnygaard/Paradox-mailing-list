Subject: Re: Sitting in Paradox


Thank you for your response Alastair

I have not built my Paradox yet so this is an anticipated problem rather than something I have experienced.  However, I do anticipate a need for a solution.  I have "restless leg" syndrome and sitting flat on the floor would be really uncomfortable for me.  Unlike yourself, I plan on staying aboard locked-up inside for significant periods of time in bad weather.  My sailing grounds are the Gulf of St.Lawrence, Anticosti Is., Gaspe coast, Iles de la Madelaine with possible extensions to St. Pierre &amp; Miquelon and St. John's, Newfoundland.

Hoping for calm nights but expecting worse
