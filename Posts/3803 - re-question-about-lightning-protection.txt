Subject: Re: Question about lightning protection

Ahh, I get it now.  I saw your vacuum-bagging setup, but thought it was with a layer of glass over the flashing.  Problem solved!
Now I'm curious: does the exposed copper provide any noticeable anti-fouling properties?  I 
was tempted to use copper powder in the bottom epoxy, but I think that will have to wait for a different season.  Plenty else to get done first!

Thanks, Matt
