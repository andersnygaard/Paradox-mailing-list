Jim,

Sorry to hear about the trailer. I was very impressed with Alastair's for 'Little Jim'. I like the flat roller concept that allows his boat to be winched onto her trailer from a firm beach.

As Al has pointed out in the thread, the problem is getting the boat off a soft beach, but if you can design one to do it, you are onto a winner! Patent the idea - you might make a fortune.

Bill.
