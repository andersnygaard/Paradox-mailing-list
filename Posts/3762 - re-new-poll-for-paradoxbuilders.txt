Seems to me that Stephen is trying to find a solution to a problem that does not even exist.

Almost every builder sails it without enough ballest the first time or two, but so what? No harm done as these are short test sails anyway.

More important is to start building and worry about the ballast needed when the hull is in the water once or twice.
