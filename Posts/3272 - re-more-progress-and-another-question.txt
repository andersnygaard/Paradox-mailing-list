Ideally you want the top of the wedge parallel to the oar, but I don't suppose it really matters.

I was thinking of fitting a wedge to the transom (like Little Cruiser), as you suggested, with a tube in it to take the rowlock. Without the rowlock in it can hold a flagstaff.
Would the angle of the wedge be critical or is it just to move the pivot point further back?
