Hi, sorry for the late reply. I hope your ok to accept cash by post, this is the system i used when i purcased my paradox plans and my articals from Don. Apparently you may have some trouble with an English personal check overseas.

Since im in England, is the shipping is more? And are you ok to send a copy here? If so how much. Please reply with a Yes or No, and a Price, and ill send you some money. You can get me on this group or at my email, kevin1b@yahoo.co.uk .

Thanks
KEvin
