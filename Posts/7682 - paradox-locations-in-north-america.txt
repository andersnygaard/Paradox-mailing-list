Subject: Paradox locations in North America

Hi fellow Paradox enthusiasts,

I'd like to know where other Paradox boats in North America are located, because it sure would be nice to sail mine with another and compare notes (read- one-sided learning).  Since I have to drive all the way across America from Qu=C3=A9bec to Washington state (5500 km) and back, and I'm retired, I could basically visit anywhere sometime during the next year.

So far as I know Sean and Scout (formerly Tardis) are in lake Havasu (Sean, I might be able to come to the Microcruiser's convention in February!), and there is one (Mike Beebee's construction) which was recently sold in Texas somewhere, the original Paradox is in Florida, and I see on Pete's Johanna's site that in the USA there is also Jill Baby, Whisper, Odyssey and Raffles (Zoe has been wrecked IIRC).

I would certainly enjoy meeting these other Paradox owners and going on a double Paradox sail!  Anyone?  There are also a few Enigma's around, as I can gather from Dave Bolduc's wonderful microcruising site.

If and when I do visit, I promise to be a nice guy and especially very respectful of your privacy.

In advance, thanks for any replies to this unusual request.
