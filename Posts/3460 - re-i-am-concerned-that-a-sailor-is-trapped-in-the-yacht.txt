It is a comfort thing. I have quite often sailed with the hatch shut, because it was more comfortable that way. I have occasionally managed to get the rail under when pushing it in sheltered water, but that is a long way from putting the hatch under. On the only occasion that I have had a 90 degree knock-down I had closed up much earlier as the conditions deteriorated.

On that occasion I had on a harness which was cleated on the aft deck, so the hatch was held open by the thickness of the webbing. I remember seeing water flowing in through this gap, and my sleeve got wet, however afterwards there was not enough water inside to use the bilge pump, so I sponged it dry.

Remember that Paradox is designed to be sailed from inside, it is not merely a cabin that you can retreat into but is a comfortable sailing position with good all-round vision and plenty of ventilation. I often choose to use it even on bright calm sunny days.
