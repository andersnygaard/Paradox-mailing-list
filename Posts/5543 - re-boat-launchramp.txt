Yes he does!! In fact, to my memory, it is sooo good that when my boat is finished I believe I will run away from home to relocate there. Funny thing, I'm from Kansas and my Granny's name is Dorothy, so the first time I leave home as a youngster I went to the Emerald City (Seattle). (to be a wizard) heh. I spent my whole infamous teen years there.... the best place on the continent I have been so far.

Hi Steve.
What a great area you live in for sailing.
I should think it is a PARADOX sailors dream.
You have got years of sailing ahead of you, and not see the same thing twice.

I live in the tiny village of Manchester. We have a boat launchramp too. It's location is, for anyone interested, 47 deg. 33' 21.16" N by 122 deg. 32' 35.41" W During the work week it is used very little. East of here is the Seattle skyline. Sometimes in the summer evenings the golden light of sunset will reflect off many of the glass windows in that city and give us a show of "golden diamonds". I've seen these from my kayak mostly. My neighbor has too many trees for me to see this from my home. Our winter wind storms always miss his trees too. Cheers, Steve Yahn
