Subject: Re: The Paradox ZOE is listed for sale on Sailing Texas classifieds.

Well, as the new owner of Zoe I look forward to keeping you all posted. I have followed Paradox threads for many years and never thought I'd have the chance to own one - now I have to take some sailing lessons.

First some outings in a local lake, then the SF Bay, and one day beyond the Golden Gate for some coastal sailing - assuming, of course, I enjoy sailing (them Pacific waters are rough). I figured the risk was worth it, and it should not be hard to resell Zoe if I find myself over my head.

Looking forward to future dialog...
