Subject: Re: Stopping spammers - require confirmation before adding new users?

As a follow on to this problem, a member of another group that I follow has suggested using the daily digest instead of the individual e-mails. He reports receiving only the occasional Spam. why don't we try it before closing the group. Any thoughts?

Hi everyone,

I could do this but it makes life more difficult because I will not always be around to approve members so we will need a second or third moderator. Any volunteers? I hope to be off sailing for a couple of months as soon as it gets cool enough. Of course we could always just start going to Yahoo to check posts and not receive e-mails. What say yee.

Apparently there are scripts which allow someone to sign up to become
members of Yahoo and join groups to post spam.  Could we get this
group changed so that new members have to be approved by the moderator?
