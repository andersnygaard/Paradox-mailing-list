Subject: Main sheet

Ok, waiting for epoxy to dry and continuous looks at plans and build manual. I don't know if I missed it or not but I cannot find the location of the mainsheet anywhere. The Vent drawings only show 2 lines coming thru. When I look at the interior pics of Zoe I see three lines? I checked back post and found that Zoe was modified for the engine as I would like to have a small motor I like this arrangement. The link that showed Glen's setup however is no good anymore. Does anyone have any help? I would like to know the original config. and also the one on Zoe. 

Thank-you for any help,
Rod
