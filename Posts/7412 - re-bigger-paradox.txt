Hello Chris.
You do realize that changing by the size of the boat, some of the propotions will have to change (mainly the beam to waterline aspect...)
 
This idea sounds really interesting....

Hi my name is Chris, 

I am also from Germany. I will try to build a bigger (20%) Paradox in 2014.
I am on Expeditions for the last 25 years, so I know exactly what I need and that would be a little bit bigger Paradox, because I want to spend 4-9 month at a time in the boat...
I think Matt said 20 % bigger would be fine with his design...
Am I wrong???
