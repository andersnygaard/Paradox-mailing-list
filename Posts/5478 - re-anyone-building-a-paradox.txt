Subject: Re: Anyone building a paradox

Hello Al, if you dont mind me asking how tall are you? If I rember right the floor had 6'2" of length so maby you are closer to my height. Its good to know that the sleeping area can be extended please let me know your results next weekend. 

As far as Swaggie, I will look at her again but paradox size, cost, and the shallow draft are better for me. Around here we mostly have calm lakes with tree stumps just below the surface so shallow draft are prefeered for camping boats. And the shallow draft will allow some river adventures. But most important I want to have paradox to duplicate the trips made by Matt and David into the Bahamas.
