Subject: Mast is offset?

I read something last night about the mast being offset to the left of center. I can't find it today despite a lot of searching, so I guess I'll have to ask more dumb questions.

Is this true?

If so, several questions spring to mind:

Why? If the mast is truly to the left of the centerline, why is the sail on the left side of the mast, making it further from the centerline? It would seem more logical to put the sail on the starboard side, placing it more on the centerline. Has anyone tried putting the sail on the starboard side of the mast?
