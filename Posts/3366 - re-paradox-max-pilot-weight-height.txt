Subject: Re: Paradox max pilot weight ,height

Absolutely, but I'd bet Matt and companion didn't match this guy's mass and they were in two 
parts. One part could wriggle left while the other went right, or port and starboard.
Fair do's, I honestly think that at the end of building you need something that is a reasonable 
fit. mass wise I'm getting close to the comfortable limit but I am blessed with short height :0)

I have just read "The Stormy voyage of Father's Day" by Hugo Vihlen. 
105 days in a boat 5ft 4in long. What are these people thinking of 
when they say that Paradox isn't big enough.  :->

that Stephen Ladd spent 3 years in a boat a little shorter than a Paradox.
