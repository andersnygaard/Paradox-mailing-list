Subject: Re: Topping Lift

Steve,

Good Luck on your sail. I wish I thought I could do this part successfully.... but the price to have them do it is not much more.

Over double Rod. It has to be added to the cost of the sail kit itself.

I have input sail dimensions for some other designs  (Michalak) and the area is not always the same as stated on the plans but close. The tack angles often look a bit high as well for some reason.

The prices are certainly reasonable.

So I would still go with the smaller one for Paradox. And add the topping lift exactly as shown on Zoe.
