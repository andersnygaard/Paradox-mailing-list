Thanks for the progress report on ENUF. Your story reminds me of why I built "the big wheel" last year to turn over LITTLE CRUISER. In the past a neighbor or even my 105 lb wife helped me move LC. However, things never seemed to go as planned, and I was always afraid of damaging the boat. Now I move our microcruiser around solo using a block and tackle, a jacks or "the big wheel. The solo method is a little slow, but it does avoid the stress involved with working with others who may be be less adept at moving heavy objects carefully.

By the way, you can see a picture of our sharpie trailer at http://www.microcruising.com/Graphics/trailer1b.jpg.
