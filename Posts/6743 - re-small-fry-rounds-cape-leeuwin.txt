Hi Guys,

I have had the same thing, not alot of water coming in from the rudder hole, so I fixed it, I took a piece of black EDPM rubber, roofing rubber, and  made a nice flexible boot that is tie wrapped around the rudder, and clamped to hull, it really does not need to be a completely watertight setup, it just deflects the water away rather than that shot 
of water that sometimes enters and explodes when it hits the baffle, kind of like a boot you would see on a sports car shifter.
