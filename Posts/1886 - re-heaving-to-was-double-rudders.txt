The term heaving-to actually refers to stopping a vessels forward momentum but most sailors are under the impression that the maneuver is accomplished by backing the jib and putting the helm down. It is however done by any means possible and in the case of the Paradox the easiest way would be to lay to a sea anchor. 

It is advisable, as DC pointed out in an earlier post, to lie a few degrees off the wind for comforts sake and also to do so on the starboard tack so that you have the right of way. This can all be accomplished by setting the sea anchor to starboard and having a line led aft from the rode which would allow you to haul in the anchor warp enough to let the bow fall off to port until she settles into a comfortable ride. DC described how to do this with a snatch block on the end of the aft haul line in an earlier post on sea anchors.

One of the best if not the best authority on foul weather tactics was Capt. Voss and he devoted a lot of words to the subject in his book "The Venturesome Voyages of Captain Voss" and "40,000 Miles in a Canoe" which are actually the same story but the later leaves out his voyage in the "Xora" but all the sea anchor info on heaving-to can be found in both books. They are also a great read and available through the usual online sources.
