I have been using Raka all winter in Florida. 60 degrees seems to be an important ambient temperature. If you use the Raka below that temperature sometimes you have to wait days for it to get hard.

The slow hardener takes a couple of days anyway to get hard.

Over 60, the fast hardener will be like a rock in 24 hours.

I've tried a sample of the RAKA brand, and I found it a little too flexible and hard to sand for my taste. It seemed to gum up my sandpaper. Maybe I just mixed it wrong or used too small of an amount for the test. I will have to try it again.
