Andre, about your idea for keeping the boat warm all night with soapstone:

The ability of a substance to hold heat for a given temperature is called "specific heat." Among substances that can be handled without high technology, the one with the greatest specific heat is -- water! Heat a gallon or two on the stove and put it in a bottle. Better still, put some in a hot water bottle and tuck it into your sleeping bag.
