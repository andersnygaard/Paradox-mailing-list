Subject: Re: Hello .. with question about chine runners

Andrew,

This is a combination of some earlier posts.

Paradox uses chine runners to reduce lateral movement through the
water. They are aerodynamic "wings" located at the chines on both
sides of the boat.  They are made of wood and do not contain any ballast.

In the words of Sven Yrvind: "I am now convinced that the
chinerunner concept, created by Matt in 1982, is the greatest
innovation for small cruising boats in the last century."

And ..." After a decade studying Paradox, and talking to Matt I have
come to understand that the boat's leeway-resistance comes from a
combination of three sources, the chinerunners, the lifting body
shaped hull and the large rudder."

There's no better place to start understanding Paradox than reading
the chapter from Sven's book entitled Chapter 9 (in the files section
of this group).

Also have a look at his blog about the new boat.
