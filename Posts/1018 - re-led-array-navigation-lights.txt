Take a look at Daves site:

The supplier he refers to is prompt on delivery and the prices are reasonable.  I have mine but just haven't had time to wire up the array.

Does anyone know a good source for LED array navigation lights?  I'm 
just about to the point where I need to start thinking about running 
the wiring before the deck goes on.  I'm under 20 feet, and don't have 
a motor, so USCG approval isn't strictly necessary, but would be nice.
I'd like to run everything off rechargeable dry cells and a solar
charger, where "everything" consists of just the nav lights and a
night light for the compass.  (And maybe a LED array reading light 
in the main cabin.)

Does anyone have experience with such things?  I had originally thought
to use the self-contained dinghy nav lights, but they'd be out of 
reach from the cockpit, and I don't want to have to crawl around on
the ends of the deck to turn them on....
