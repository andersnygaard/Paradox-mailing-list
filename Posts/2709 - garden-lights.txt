Subject: 'Garden' lights

Hi Dave,

I guess there are different types of these, and I thought the same as you but have found that now its autumn here the 'test' one (in the garden!) only goes for maybe 2 hours after dark- there's just not enough incoming radiation to recarge it each day, even on a clear day.

In the summer though it was still going at 3am. Still be a good idea with its 360 degree diffuser thingy, but might have to be powered by a lead from another battery.

I've also bought a small solar AA nicad recharger, and plan to try mounting its much larger solar panel into the garden-light to see how it goes with that. I'm sure the concept is 'brilliant' even if the light-output isn't!

Alan.
