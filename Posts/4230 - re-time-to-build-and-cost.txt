Jim Michalak did design an easier to build Paradox knock-off called Robbsboat with his usual interesting design study.

Someone built a lightly built Paradox using stitch and glue, and although not as heavily built still had fun with it. Given the choice of the two I'd opt for the stitch and glue Paradox, at least you know the shape is proven.
