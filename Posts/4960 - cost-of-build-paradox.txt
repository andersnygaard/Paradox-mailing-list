Subject: Cost of Build - Paradox

Can anyone tell me what the difference in cost is between a dogs rowlocks top job build and an economy version?

And as the boat is going to be pickled in glass and epoxy, can I get away with exterior grade ply as opposed to marine plywood as I've read somewhere that both types use the same glues?

Thanks in anticipation.
Greg
