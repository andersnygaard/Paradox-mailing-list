It sounds like something is binding in the roller mechanism. The position of the boom should be irrelevant as it's connected through a universal joint.
Does the boom rotate freely in all positions?
Do you have the retaining screw in place to keep the boom on the furling strop? (I don't).
Is it binding?

A topping lift will make everything so much easier as it takes the weight of the boom off the halyard.
I'd recommend giving one a try. Most people use one.

Here's a good example of how the topping lift is set up (and a nice furling demo too):

From your description, it sounds like the attachment point to your yard is too far forward.
Do you have the correct taper on your boom?

Furling is definitely an acquired technique; you have to juggle both halyard and downhaul tensions at the same time. Once you have it however it should become straight forward.

Keep playing!
