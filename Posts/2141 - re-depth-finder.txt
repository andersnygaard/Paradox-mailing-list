The answer to your first question is, of course, no. But then, I don't really require a boat either.....

In normal sailing trim the Paradox draws about 30 inches. This is with the rudder down, with the rudder up it can be sailed in less than a foot.

My sailing ground has a lot of soft mud banks often 2 or 3 feet below the surface. I have found that when tacking up a channel against wind and tide it is important not to get into the mud as it is not immediately obvious that it has happened (mud very soft) and once it is obvious then the speed has dropped so that tacking is impossible. The yuloh is no good against a 3 kn tide, and I too have no engine.

When on coastal passages a sudden change in the depth can often give a line of position, or if caught in fog, being able to follow a depth contour can lead you safely into an estuary.

And I picked up the whole caboodle, brand new, for 25UKP so I felt it was fated.

I don't *need* my gps, vhf, electric shaver or paperbacks either, but I have them. I feel the sounder adds another dimension to the sailing (pun intended). Even in deep water "looking" at the sea bed can be as interesting as looking at the sky.  So, not essential, but interesting and useful.
