I see no reason why this shouldn't work in principle. I myself 
seriously considered fitting a canvas top instead of the hatch and 
ply roof. The problem is that this would considerably reduce the 
survivability in a knock down, though it would still be much better 
than most other boats of similar size.

The bottom line is where are you going to use it. If you are mostly 
sailing in sheltered waters then it may be reasonable modification

Maybe a combination of a hard top for serious cruising, to be 
replaced with a soft top for more social outings would be the best 
compromise.
