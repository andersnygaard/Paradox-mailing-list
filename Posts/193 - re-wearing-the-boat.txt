Hi Pete,

I think a simpler solution would be to multiply every thing by a factor of 10 percent. Matt has already given his blessing for this and you would come up with a Paradox of 13' 10" X 1.1 =3D 15' 2 5/8" LOA,  4' 4 13/16' BOA, 9 7/8" DRAFT, Your head room would be 40" under the hatch (mine is 36 1/2"). In so doing I personally would not increase the size of the timbers, i.e. chine logs and sheer clamps as they are so generous to begin with. This little boat is incredibly stout for her size, a real dock rammer, good luck to any one caught in her path while she is at speed. If you've never worked with metric this is where it really shines. Just make all dimensions except timber sizes, the given times 1.1. This would probably work up to about 15 percent then you would have to consult something like Dave Gerr's BOAT STRENGTH to make sure your scantlings are still good. Hope this helps.

PSS I'm trying to finish a write up of my sea trials and get it posted, if I can just find the time. I ended up with a Coleman inflatable mattress of twin size and it is soooo comfortable.
