Subject: Steve Yahn

Just wanted to inform the group of the sad news that Steve Yahn, builder of paradox Ironsides, has passed away. I met Steve when I went to pick up the boat he sold to me. Really nice guy. From the archives, I can tell he brought many good ideas to the discussion, so I thought you guys might like to know.

My sympathies to Helen and Steve's family and friends.
