Hi Bill, 

Has anyone tried oars? 
You would need waterproof oar ports in the side of the hull when not in use, but I cannot see why it would not work as they do on John Welsford's tread lightly. 

Caroline looks great but the hull is a lot more complicated. I think that if Matt found improvement on Paradox in the form of Enigma, then some modification surely is allowed? We need to keep in mind the principles which we are designing towards. 

Yours James
