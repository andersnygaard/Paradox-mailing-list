Hi Glen,

Unfortunately or fortunately, depending on how you look at - the edit option is only available to the person who created the file/folder.

A suggestion might be that anyone who wishes to supply a response would offline it to you and you can cut and paste it in if it seems appropriate. If you are not sure then you could cut and paste it to the group for further discussion.

Another option is to use the polls function to get a opinion from those who are knowledgeable on a subject in question.

Each person might also add their name at the end if they so desire.

For example in the faq about chine runner effectiveness I might submit:

"Due to Paradox's relatively heavy displacement for it's size and the rocker of the hull, when the boat heels the lower chine runner effectively acts as a shallow fin keel would in a v-bottomed boat. The upwind chine clears the water and the lower chine effectively increases the waterline length of the boat. The result is a faster, more weatherly boat than what it would first appear to be when looking at the boat sitting at rest. Nels"
