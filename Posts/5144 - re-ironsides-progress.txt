Steve,
I'll probably do likewise with the glassing.
Good to see you have the the blade leaded. It's looking good.
I took the camera out this evening and took a few shots of my progress.
The photo's are in Johanna folder.
I've also added a few pictures to my building blog showing the foam installation.
