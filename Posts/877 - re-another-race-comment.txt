That's an interesting thought. It would require a very skilled operator. I'm not sure it meets the self-rescuing requirement. The weather at this time of the year is pretty dicey. 270 mi is a long way to hope for safe passage. It's not unreasonable for a seasoned racer. I'd like to see some new stuff too, perhaps a pacific proa like Mbuli, or maybe a fast tri. With regards to this forum, though, I am proud that Matt was so successful, and it speaks volumes for the design in terms of safety and reliability. Now, if Matt would just draw the larger version, I'd be first in line. I hope to build a marginally larger version (+10%) sometime in the near future similar in length to Little Cruiser.

What surprises me is that the Seapearl has not been more competitive.
