Hello,

I suggest that you search for "simple boat wiring diagram" on Google. You will find various books, diagrams, and websites to help you.

Here is one simple diagram that may be useful (note that you will only need the "house" wiring):

My advice is to keep your boat's electrical set up simple, tidy, and protected from water.

Cheers,
Gary
