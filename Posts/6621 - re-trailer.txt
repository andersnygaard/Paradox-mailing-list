Subject: Re: Trailer

Steve,I don't understand the problem.  All the small trailers I have seen have a capacity of 900-1,000 lbs or more.  My complaint about small trailers are that they are too high capacity and the springs are too stiff for boats.  I also keep the tire pressure on the low side to compensate....a little..JIB 

But remember the Paradox weighs 1400 lbs in sailing trim and still over 1000 lbs with the ballast out. Then there is the weight of the trailer itself ......
