I just put a cap on the shortbed pickup truck and did a little measuring. Turns out that truck bed with the cap is pretty similar in size (at least length and height) to the main section of the Paradox. That gave me enough of an idea of what the inside of the Paradox would be like that I now know that it would be plenty big enough to do some boat camping in at least for my own use. It's hard (for me) to look at blueprints and metric numbers and get a feel for the actual size. Not as good as seeing the boat in person but better than nothing.

Makes me want to build this boat even more than I already did.

Somewhere I read about someone building a full size model out of cardboard to get a feel for the size of the boat. I think it was a Paradox or might have been another of Matt's designs. I can't find the post or website that I saw that on but it might be an option for a non-floating model.

I keep thinking of making a model possibly just a box the approximate size of the main interior space just to see how it feels inside that size space. If I can find big enough pieces of cardboard and duct tape that should work or just a quick wood frame covered with a tarp. I might even build something a little stronger that would fit in the bed of a small pick up truck and actually try to camp in it. I'd hate to spend the time and money to build this boat for real and then find out I can't stand being closed in a space that size. I've gone backpacking before with a tiny pup tent so this boat should be better than that but I can't get a good enough idea of the size just by holding a tape measure beside me.

I hope both of you find a real one to examine up close but if not cardboard and tape would be quicker and cheaper than the real plywood and fiberglass/epoxy.
