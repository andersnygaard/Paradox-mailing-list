I made a simple cast, 3 straight sides, 1 angled about 45degrees (as
to the drawing), then cut lots of 5cm, about 10-25cm long, strips from
my thick (613 g/m2) fiberglass cloth and made a VERY (about 6cm) thick
lamination. Since that much fiberglass should be strong but might
serve as a bad wearing surface, I made a Delrine bushing for the
bronze rod.
Of course, I don't know if it works
