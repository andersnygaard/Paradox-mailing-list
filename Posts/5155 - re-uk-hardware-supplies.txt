Hi Jeff

I don't know what I need them for yet, just sourcing bits and pieces and that's what the plans say I need.

Does anyone have a view on copper nails?  I've acquired a potful of them, courtesy of the good ol' carboot sale, and it would be a shame not to use them if there's a suitable application.  Nelson had his ships built with copper rivets, so they can't be all that bad I suppose!

I might have a word with Screwfix, I've dealt with them in the past and you never know, they might be able to get hold of some bronze fixings even though they're not in the catalogue.  Worth a try anyway!

As for ply, I'll be looking at far-eastern WBP first.
