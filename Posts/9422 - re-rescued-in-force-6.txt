Hi Roselt,

Thank you for the info in how your cabin as built. If you don’t mind I have another question for you. If you had an outboard on your Paradox do you think the outcome might have been different. You mentioned that the boat was being pushed backwards. Assuming the outboard stayed running would it have made being inside a paradox in rough conditions more comfortable.
