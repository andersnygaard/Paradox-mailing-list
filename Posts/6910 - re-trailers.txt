Hi Jim,

I have indispension type units on my trailer and they seem to offer a fairly soft ride. I was actually surprised after my first trip that my little duck mascot was just where I left him on the front window sill.
So little moves around that i don't even bother wedging stuff down on the shelves. I wonder if the rubber hardens with age and ceases to become an effective damper.

Anyway lets not forget a grand UK Paradox Rally sometime before the summers over, I launched from Ridge Wharf last week and found it a great spot.
