Subject: Re: Paradox Plans - the studying of.

Welcome aboard Greg. Yes I know what you mean about A3 paper. To be honest most of my studying was done on the soft copy drawings. I would say that I pretty much know every mark on the plans from memory!

Yes. It's actually very straight forward once you start to do it (although I made a real bo bo when I cut mine; see my blog entry towards bottom of this page http://www.freewebs.com/paradoxbuild/buildingblog.htm?archived=3D1&amp;page=3D2) I found Don Eliot's building Paradox booklet quite useful here, as he describes in some detail how he approached the task. 

There's several photos:
Bill's: http://www.smallsailboats.co.uk/paradox/build3/mast_test3.jpg and Glen's on this site in the Files area, Folder named "Vent Trunk"

I haven't done this bit yet (although I'm close) but again Don's booklet describes it well. Once again Bill's photo's show pretty well what you're after, quite a few here http://www.smallsailboats.co.uk/paradox/build4.htm

I'm not sure I undersatnd the question, but I think the answer is yes! Build the side frames on a jig with bottom and top rails glued together with corner posts at the correct angles. Again see http://www.smallsailboats.co.uk/paradox/build4/win_frame.jpg

I'll leave that one to someone who has a completed boat :-)

Join the club. I've found that most things actually become self explanatory once you get round to doing the job. Sitting back with a cup of tea and just staring at it works wonders.

Good Luck.
I'll be sanding a bit more tomorrow in preaprtaion for internal painting....
