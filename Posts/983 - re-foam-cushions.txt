I've used Therm-a-Rest cushions with great pleasure. They're light,
insulating, self inflating, take up very little space when rolled up,
and they come in a few different sizes. The Therm-a-Rest Classic is
2.25" thick, I believe. Good stuff, though a bit more expensive than
Glen's fine idea. I bought mine on sale at REI. I guess they're
available all over the place now, and I seem to remember a fine warranty.

I think that I will look for an innertube, which I'll cover with
Sunbrella. Seems like one could secure the innertube to a single point
on the centerline of the helmseat/sole. Then the innertube could be
flipped from side to side, depending on tack, etc...

I think that some 1" closed cell foam could be useful as (temporary)
fenders, as well as kneeling pads, thrown against the lee side bins to
brace against, etc...
