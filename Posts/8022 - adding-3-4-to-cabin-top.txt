Subject: Adding 3-4" to cabin top?
Date: 05 Sep 2014 08:10:05 -0700

Hello All,

I am looking at the Paradox as a future project. I am a little concerned about the head room of the cabin. I need 37" to sit up with "proper" posture. As the design work on this little ship seems very "tight" I am wondering what factors I would run into if I add to the over all height of the cabin top. Has anyone successfully added a dome or pram hood to the cabin slide? I understand that the design is scale-able, but I am inclined to build as close to design as possible.

Thanks,
Woody
