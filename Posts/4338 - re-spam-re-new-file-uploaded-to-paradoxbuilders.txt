The only suggestion I would make Perry, would be give the rig a higher aspect ration in order to get the batten ends inboard of the transom. I once converted an Albin Vega to junk rig and sailed it for many years. Really enjoyed the ease of use and can honestly report that with the exception of a little loss of windward performance she was a delight to sail. Her best off shore noon to noon run was 173 nautical miles before a 25 kt. nor easter. Having sailed both rigs I would not personally want to change my lug for a junk on Zoe due to weight of spar consideration and the extra line needed to manage the sail. The lug has more then enough string to pull as it is. Another consideration would be that it's hard to beat the ease of sail stowage on the side deck of the paradox. If you go ahead with the build I'll look forward to sailing along side for a comparison of the two rigs. Good luck with the development.
