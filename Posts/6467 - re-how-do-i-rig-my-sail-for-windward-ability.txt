Thanks for everyone's comments.

I've been getting the sail set up pretty tight without wrinkles and it appears to be set well aside from a fair amount of twist. At a guess I'd say the yard hangs out a good 20 degrees, maybe more, compared to the boom.

I have Small Fry ballasted to the designed water line... sometimes a little over. I might experiment with the sheeting angle a bit more. It sounds like others sheet in harder that I have so far.

In 20 knots I'd normally have a fair amount reefed, perhaps down to 65% of the sail area, and down to about 50% by 25 knots. I have been out in stronger winds, but 25 is about the maximum I feel able to attempt windward sailing (despite my lack of progress). Over 25 knots I have to reef the sail so much that my only real options are running off or heaving to (heaving to works well under that little triangle that won't roll up on the higher peaked version of the sail).

Something else I've noticed with reefing is that the more the sail is reefed the less neatly the yard is pulled in close to the mast. I'm thinking perhaps some kind of parrel at the yard might help... anyway I'll tinker with it and see what I can come up with.

Regarding photos: I've now added an album 'Small Fry Australia' with a few snaps I have on hand. I may be able to add more later.

Cheers,
Geoff.
