Subject: Paradox update

Dear Paradox Builders,

I am happy to announce that the Paradox website has been updated. Please visit http://www.paradox-uk.co.uk/ to view the latest updates. 

I have also included a few pictures of my own Paradox. These images cover my first efforts building the deck beams, cabin beams, and hatch beams. 

If you know anyone else who is building a Paradox, please let me know so I can include their information on the website: http://www.paradox-uk.co.uk/names.htm

Best regards,

Bill.
