Hi Dereck,

Excited there is a proceedure that will help with diabetes. Could 
you send me a link or email about the proceedure?
I really hope it works out well for you and I know everyone would 
like you to come back and let us know your alright.  Remember this 
is a group and we need your expertise and support to keep it going.  
The best of all it's free, no dues required.

Best wishes,

Niels
