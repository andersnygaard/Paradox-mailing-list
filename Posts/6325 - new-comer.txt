Hi All,

My name is Gil Kolan, and I live in Israel. I have built a PDR and sailed it on the mediterranean  and the lake of Galilee. The Paradox sailboat came up in one of the threads and immediately caught my eye. So I bought the plans, easy and straight forward. Yet when I tried to complete the order of paper work with the Paradox build manual I was not so successful.

Can anyone tell me how I can buy acopy of this manual?

Thanks
G i l
