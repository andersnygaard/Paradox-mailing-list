Subject: Re: Going from 2d plans to 3d plans

Hi everybody,

my name is Wolfgang, german sailor living in Brazil and pretty new to this group. Also the first time piping here to back up Fernando on his just crusade for Sketchup. I=B4m using this program for a long time now, actually before Google bought the company and there=B4s nothing i build without drawing it first. It sure brings sense to 2D plans, especially if you are not a strong 3D brain owner like me.

So while my Paradox plans arrived last week and me still having to finish a sailing canoe, my evenings are busy by reading the old posts and of course drawing the boat in 3D, which will be amazingly helpful in the real building process. Sketchup is also really helpful if you have an idea and want to check if it will work in real life. 

Cheers,
Wolfgang
