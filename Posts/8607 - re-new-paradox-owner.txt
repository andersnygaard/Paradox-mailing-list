Congrats Curtis,

I believe that boat was listed on the web  and asking price was about 7k. I too am in the market to purchase, however I have noticed that not many are listed for sale especially on the east side of the US.

Best to you and again congrats to you on your new boats.

Fair winds,
Deric
