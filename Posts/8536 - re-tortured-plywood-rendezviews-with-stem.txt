Hi Bobby,

I had a long and supportive reply for you and then Yahoo decided to blitz it so this will now be short!

I unscrewed each bulkhead and transom on alternate sides so the boat didn't fall over and then I clamped, glued and nailed from the stem to the transom. That way the boat's sides were splayed far apart when attaching the stem and it wasn't a huge battle. To do it this way you do have to do a dry fit first bending the sides around the widest beam of the boat, so that you can put in the guiding screws for the final fitting.

To stop the clamps slipping on the stem, I put some drywall screws in front of them. I don't care about the extra holes the screws make as I'll be fibreglassing the whole boat anyway.

Cheers,

Rob.
