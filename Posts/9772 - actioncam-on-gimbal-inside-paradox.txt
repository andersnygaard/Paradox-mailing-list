Hello all,

I wanted to share a video posted by Eerik Mee on Youtube. The video shows Eerik mounting an action cam on a gimbal inside his 'dox, allowing for a unique view of the heeling while sailing. I haven't seen this done before by others who have filmed inside the 'dox, so it's definitely worth a watch!

Here's the link to the video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DN_3uhoWdb2g&amp;feature=3Dshare

Thanks for sharing the video, Eerik.

Best regards,

Deric
