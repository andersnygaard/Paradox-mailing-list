I have done some reading about unstayed masts, but not alot, and since I am new to sailing I guess this would be a good time to ask this question. I have gone over this part on the plans and cannot find a clamp or anything that holds the mast in the vent trunk, I mean what stops it from just flying out of the mounting hole once a strong gust hits the sail? Is it kept in by force of the halyard and sheet? Or is it that the depth of the mounting combined with the halyard and sheet? If possible and anyone has the time could somebody give a step-by-step of how the Paradox mast is stepped, errr,... stood up and put into place. I dont want to do this part wrong when it comes time and it occurred to me it might be a diffirent process on a Paradox than a normal unstayed mast. 

Thanks,
Rod

No stays,

You reduce the sail. Lower it by rolling it onto the reefing drum. If you look at the pictures that came with the plans, Matt is sailing in some strong winds, the sail is reefed in. One of the Paradox's strong points are that this can be done without having to go out on the deck to do it.
