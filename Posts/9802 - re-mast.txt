Take my reply with suspicion as I haven't built one, but since you haven't gotten any replies here goes:

Sheet diameter given on DWG #1 lower right corner (I'm looking at the low resolution plans on the CD, so hard for me to read).

Can't find halyard diameter on cd drawings but is given in Materials1.text file on cd as 5/16" Dacron line for tiller, halyard, and sheet.

The sheet diameter appears to differ on the drawing as compared to the Materials1.text file, so you should recheck printed plans, CD may be older. ( I got my plans many years ago, so check your set for any revisions.)

The 60 degree angle on the sheave must be because the sail is on the port side, and rotates around the mast a bit, so just picking a midpoint (completely guessing here), as I haven't built one, just reviewing plans lately.
