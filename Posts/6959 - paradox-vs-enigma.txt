Subject: Paradox vs Enigma

Hello,

I just discovered paradox after reviewing hundreds of small boats and it ticks all the boxes for me.

I plan to start building in a few months or so and am wondering if i am better off waiting for the enigma plans to be available?

I have never worked with wood before beyond making a small table in highschool and the paradox seems like a tricky build even for experienced builders.

A stitch and glue seems much easier, lighter and more durable.

Does the enigma have any features that the paradox doesnt have?

Being a heavier boat, is the paradox considered more seworthy and can handle rougher conditions?

Anyone know when the enigma will be available?

Any advice or opinions would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks :)
