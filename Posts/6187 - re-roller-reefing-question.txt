Subject: Re: Roller reefing question

He put the Y in it so that the boom could still move forward and aft, while sailing, but restrict the side to side (wrist) movement at the Y. That makes to boom stand up on the tube and reach all the way to the side of the boat when it lays down. That improves its function but is not absolutely necessary.

This was mentioned not so very long ago.
Here's the original drawing.
