I still had three questions that nobody has commented on yet, so I'll recap them in the hope I can get an answer and cross them off my list.

I know some of these question I could figure out a solution for on my own, but asking allows me to avoid dumb mistakes and introduces better ideas than I may have thought of myself.:

- How many yards of 38" wide woven roving (using three layers on bottom) and 50" 6.0 oz fiberglass cloth (using one layer everywhere else) to order?  I estimated 28 yards and 20 yards respectively, with plenty of extra scrap.  Enough?  *Way* too much?

- How are the shelves mounted to the bin sides?  Just epoxy?  A cleat (not shown in drawing)?  Just using screws or nails would be attaching to the end grain of the plywood shelf where it would not hold well.

- I don't at all understand how the "metal angle" shown on page 5 is to be used, or attached.  Can someone please go into further detail of this?  What length angle to get, and is that 1"x1" angle iron?
