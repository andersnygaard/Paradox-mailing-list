Derek,

The epoxy needs to be shielded from the rays of the sun to protect its vulnerability to the Ultraviolet component of the visible light spectrum. You will need to coat the epoxy with varnish that has UV inhibitors or paint. Paint has the opacity to shield the UV from the epoxy.

As for colors: take a look at the traditional boats in your area and then select a color that is complimentary in the color scheme just to offer an alternative and keep your self visible. http://www.faceters.com/askjeff/answer52.shtml

So what colour are the boats in your local harbor Derek? I seem to remember sailing a boat on the pond on Penn Common (is that still there?).

Hoping for calm nights
