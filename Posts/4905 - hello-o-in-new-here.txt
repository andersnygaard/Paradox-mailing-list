Subject: Hello :o) In new here.

Hiya folks,

I've been studying this boat for a few weeks now and decided to join this group.

I have been reading the voyage accounts of Matt Layden's and Sven Yrvind's voyages in this tiny boat and frankly I'm impressed.

I like all the details except for two points.

First, the offset mast rankles my sense of symmetry, I would prefer it to be on the centre line. I guess he placed it to port to allow for access to the forward compartment.

Second, the boat is just a fraction on the small side for me as I would prefer company on longer adventure and would prefer just a little 'elbow' room.

My question is this, is there anything wrong with the idea of buying Matts plans for Paradox and 'scaling them up' slightly to allow for forward access but have the mast on centre, and killing two birds with one stone and having a slightly bigger boat?

Will her amazing sea keeping abilities be affected by scaling her up so?
