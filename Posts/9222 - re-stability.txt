I'm getting way off topic, but being pulled behind a boat, and using a diving plane, looks like great fun!

I grew up sailing 25 ft daysailers in Miami every summer. A favorite past time was throwing a line out the stern, jumping off and being pulled behind the boat. Of course the skipper would then set a course for the nearest and largest patch of seaweed much to the chagrin of the guy in the water. There were a few baiting suit bottoms lost but never any bloodied hands. And it was relatively easy for a moderately fit person to pull themselves back to the boat even without slowing her down.

Cheers.
