I think it is probably LC's rudder, it is certainly not off a Paradox.

You could do worse than photocopy the section shown up to full size and make some cardboard templates. For some reason aerofoils have less drag with a square trailing edge rather than coming to a sharp edge (much more robust as well).

The blade needs to be flat where it rubs against the stock so shape that side as far as you can then blend it into the flat face. On the outside shape to above the water-line, but leave the radius, where the groove for the uphaul is, at full thickness. Again make a smooth blend from one shape to the other.

After a couple of seasons I found the leading edge of the rudder was showing signs of wear where it rubs on the bottom if you don't haul it up soon enough. I have seen, on Duckworks, the suggestion that a groove in the leading edge filled with a length of dacron rope soaked in epoxy solves this. However my solution was to split a length of copper water pipe and hammer this to shape round the leading edge and bottom, bonding with epoxy. After 3 seasons it is showing no signs of damage, though the paint keeps getting rubbed off.
