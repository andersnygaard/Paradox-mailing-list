Subject: paradox in foam

G'day, 

I am new to this group but look forward to building the paradox. I know the plans call for it to be built in plywood but I am wondering if anyone has tried to build it in foam. If this has not been done yet what needs to change when converting plywood plans to foam construction or is it just the materials that change? 

Any feedback would be appreciated.

Thanks,
Greg
