If you mean the 28 day Ultimate Challenge that may be the case especially when it comes to paddlers (if you recall, Matt continued on after the finish to sail home), but the Everglades Challenge has been known to weed out boats due to mechanical failures. At the risk of opening another can of worms, aren't most races like that (a test of crews)? I recall a race in the English Channel a few years ago where the weather turned especially bad and the authorities were busy rescuing crews from the boats. When the weather cleared many of the boats were still afloat and now crewless. That is not to say that racing boats do not sink. They do and once full of water their lead keels pull them down faster than our smaller boats with positive flotation.
