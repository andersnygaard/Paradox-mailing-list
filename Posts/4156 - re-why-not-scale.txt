Subject: Re: Why not scale?

Scaling up a boat of any design is not exactly straightforward. Displacement increases cubically, stability increases to the 4th power, etc.

To take an existing design and increase the sizes can only normally be done in small increments, perhaps 15%-20% max. Beyond that, you really should go to a new design, which may be similar in style, intent, and layout.

A lot of people are suggesting a larger Paradox might be a good idea so you can more reasonably take a friend. I would suggest a totally new design is more to the point than just increasing the same design. There is a precedent in Matts and Dave and Mindy's Little Cruiser. With considerably more space inside you need to find other efficient ways of using it.

Paradox as designed is pretty much just right. The small size is really an advantage in terms of project size, storage, towage, weight etc. but it does not suit everyone's needs. Perhaps Matt or someone might prepare a new design in the 15 to 18 foot range, just big enough to allow two good friends to cruise in reasonable comfort.

A bigger boat that may actually meet the requirements would be Bolgers little water ballasted (19Ft) canoe yawl. I do not think this design has been actually finished or built, but as a seaworthy small coastal cruiser, this seems to have the same basic requirements and looks as if it would be a lovely boat.
