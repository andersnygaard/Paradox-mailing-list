I was surprised it hadn't been completed by anyone yet as well.  Half the reason I picked it was so I could finally see pictures and videos of one sailing:-)

Thanks Tom,

Robbsboat sounds like what I am looking for.  I bookmarked your site and will check out all of it as soon as I can and continue following along as you work on it.  As much searching as I have done looking at Matt's boats I'm surprised I never heard of this boat before.
