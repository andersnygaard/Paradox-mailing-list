I'm sorry Rod but SWAGGIE is nothing like a PARADOX. It is a totally different beast.
2'-8" draught and weighing in at over 4000 lbs, it is a cruising boat in the traditional sense.
Although PARADOX is heavy for its size, it has a draught of only 9".

An 18' version could, if drawn from scratch, have a draught of about 10" and weigh about 2400 lbs, maybe less.
Because of it's designed cruising style the headroom would be not much more than its smaller brother/sister.

99% of the members to the PARADOX and Microcruising sites would like nothing more than to go cruising for a week or two, all with in easy reach of civilization. Probably spending no more than a couple of nights moored in isolation.
Matt designed PARADOX to be away, unsupported, for up to two months.
Al and Bill on their recent long cruise were always in touch with the locals except for one or two exceptions, so I will ask this of them and other owners of Paradox's.

Did you feel that there was just enough storage room on your PARADOX or, that you felt you could have done with less, i.e., that you wished that you had not taken something's because it or they were never used. Like too much food or water.
