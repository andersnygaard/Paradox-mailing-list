I think it's great that you are sailing without a motor. In my experience, it totally changes how you spend your day on the water. Not always, but many times, I don't go as far as I might have done with a motor, because I'm more risk adverse, but it has improved my sailing ability and it's very satisfying knowing that the distances covered have all been done unassisted.

You get much better at ghosting!
