Hi David,

To be honest with you I did not and I could kick myself for it. Pictures I have seen indicate that it rolls counter clockwise as seen from the cockpit. While sailing with him I was reefed for the first time for a long time and while short tacking I found that when on starboard tack (sail hanging away from mast) Zoe was one whole knot slower then when on port tack. I am going to try rolling the other way and see if there is any difference. As I mentioned earlier we both agreed that my sail shape was terrible. If there is a three-month waiting period with Dabbler Sails I might do as Matt suggested and sew it my self. After all if we can build the boat we can build the sail. I am also thinking of experimenting with the cut of the sail with poly tarp. Will keep you informed.
