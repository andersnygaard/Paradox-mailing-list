I've got a small Yahoo group that I'm the owner of. I've just looked into what's possible and the news is not good. You can request a download, but they will only give you what you posted personally, so it looks like there is no way of recovering the entire email archive. This is the problem with these corporate solutions, you end up being screwed over by them sooner or later! If we move to Facebook, the same thing will happen again. That's why Eerik's idea of an open source solution that someone is prepared to host is the only viable one in the long term.
