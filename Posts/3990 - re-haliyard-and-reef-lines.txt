I've kept my aft floorboards as per plan, except I am not using hinges.  I've supported them with under flaps from the sides of the storage bins, which can be removed.  The advantage is that either side of the floor can easily be lifted and slid forwards, giving access to the whole of the storage compartments.

I've also made side flaps/planks either side of the water tanks, which give good access to the forward ballast.

I'll be posting photos to my web site soon.

My Wife told me she refused to drink water which has been stored in an Epoxy lined tank. When she said this I realized, vaguely, I didn't feel good about it either. So It's out too. The underfloor locker at the vent trunk is a puzzle though. When I went to five different tire stores to beg for lead ballast they all wanted to charge me the retail price of about .45 cents per pound! So I may use scrap steel plate from Boeing surplus. Much cheeper. The foot drag is variable in it's power so it may be best.
