I was wondering about Tufnol for my Paradox. Do you have Tufnol on the west of the pond? It is made from a cloth laminate in some sort of resin and, though it is easy to machine, it seems impervious to most conditions and is quite stable. We use it a lot for industrial models.

Anyone got any thoughts?
