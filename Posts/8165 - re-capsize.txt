I forgot  about your point re the rudder. It also looks to me the most vulnerable part of the boat.... the weakest link.  But, to be fair, Matt designed the boat as a coastal cruiser which only ventures out onto the wide open ocean during during reasonable weather.

I'm looking forward to reading Geoff's account so that we can understand what went wrong, and why,  and the info will help us when evaluating what are suitable weather conditions.
