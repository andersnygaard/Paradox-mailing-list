Subject: Re: outboard weight

I second what David said. Less is better when it comes to putting additional weight on the transom. You can install a smaller engine and then just use the priming bulb to pump fuel into the built in tank. However, I'd recommend trying to use a sculling oar first and go "green" like I did four years ago. It's cheaper in the long run and your boating skills will improve immensely. Since that time I've grown confident enough in my skills that I was able to complete both the NC and EC Challenge which required me to scull ENIGMA a fair distance in a variety of conditions.
