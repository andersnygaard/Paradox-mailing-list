Subject: Re: Building Paradox manual by Don Elliott - how to order?

There's no question that the season would be longer in a site-inside boat.  I am currently flirting with the idea of taking the Paradox sit-inside concept and applying it to a PDRacer hull.  This would give me a boat that can be car-topped, and yet comfortably be sailed in the cold and rain.  Those of you who boat in Texas instead of New England may not understand. :-)

Matt's Sand Flee concept would fit well on a PDR.

Hoping for calm nights
