Hi Brian

There's no need for a grid to hold the fuel away from the base. It works fine without and I just rake out the grey wood ash from the bottom once a day with a teaspoon.

I'd make it slightly bigger if you're in a cold climate. My one is made from 2 inch copper tube but 3 inch dia would create more heat.

Best
Jim
