I mention this because I wonder how best to place chine runners in relation to sail CofE.  Should you treat the area of the runners as a keel extension, in determining the center of lateral plane?  Yes I think you should and I would imagine if you added the profile to the bottom of the chine curve and computed the lateral resistance from the resulting profile you would be real close. 

BTW, I finally ordered the Paradox plans.  I'm looking forward to getting a firsthand look.

Great!
