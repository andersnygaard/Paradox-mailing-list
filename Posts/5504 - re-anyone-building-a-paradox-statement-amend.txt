Sorry... girlfriend being pushy this morning to leave house and I got in a hurry.

What I mean to say is the trailerability of the "Swaggie" sux according to the video I saw of the launching of the first one. It may be there is a better way to trailer the boat and the guys were using the only equipment and know-how that was available to them. It did look awkward.

Also.... I recall... I think it was Bill or Al saying the draft of the swaggie was the same as a paradox with the rudder down?
