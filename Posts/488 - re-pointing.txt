Hi All,

Sorry about all the short Questions. I'm burning the midnight oil trying to get "Whisper" In the water. Glen, If I remember right you said you had trouble storing the mast thru the deck plate in the transom, and it was to late to modify, to correct the problem. What was going to have to be modified? I measured it should fit. Do you think the deck plate could work loose and fall out? I'm using an outboard, there will be some vibration. Any suggestions?

David
