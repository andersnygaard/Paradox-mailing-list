Alastair...  Thanks for the comments. Like you said ...it is a good feeling to know that one is seeing the same things in the boat as others that have some experience in one. There are so few folks that have actually sailed a Paradox much, and very few who have not sailed one can comprehend what the boat is truly capable of or like to sail.  Most of my buddies just look at me and shake their heads. LOL
