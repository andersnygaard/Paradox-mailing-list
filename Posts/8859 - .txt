Subject: Re: [Paradox] Warning : fresh water overload!

Nick, you're crazier than I am! Thanks for letting us know of your adventure. I've never had such close calls (yet), never had a drop of water in Iota (thus far), just hope it never happens. On this end, I've finally got the boat all packed up, looks like a go in the morning. It's loaded to the hilt! My only bug right now is a bum left shoulder, hockey incident just before I left Canada. So I'll be sailing with one arm for a few days, at least I can use the yuloh. I'll see how it goes, no promises, might have to wait some more before pushing it, at least I'll be on the water.

Be careful out there. Every boat has its limits!

Best regards,

André
