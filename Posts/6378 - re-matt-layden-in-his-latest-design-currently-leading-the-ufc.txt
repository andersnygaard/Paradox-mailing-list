Nels,
Here's a picture of Elusion with her "lid" on.

I expect he will have a spray skirt for when he has to paddle.
I'm intrigued by the vent system. He mentions in one of his updates that it's working very well. I expect that is what those 2 pipes are sticking out form the rear of the cabin. John, did you get a chance to see how these work?

Of course you don't need any spray protection when the weather is like this, just the sun hat!

I was getting a bit worried about Matt when I looked this morning and saw no updates since last night, the last one being nowhere near shore. Once his tracker restarted it looks like he spent the night either on, or anchored behind a little spoil island. It's a real race between the 3 leaders, I hope they don't push themselves to exhaustion.
