I think that it could be useful to know here that I fully realize that Paradox is a fair weather coastal micro-cruiser; But as Matt Layden says it is smart to plan for the worst. There could be countless combinations of causes to effects events that could cause even the most experienced and cautious sailor to find himself suddenly caught up in a severe sea storm. That is when the availability of pre-planned contingency equipment et "B" plan of action reward the sailor...
