Hey, thanks Al.

I agree that 5mm is hardly a concern. I wonder if you added some curve
also at blkd #4?. Seems like #4 should have the same 5mm if in fact
the transom and #3 have 5mm. Its easy to remove during the dry run if
it becomes necessary.

I won't attempt any adjustments to the stem bevel until the dry fit.
No sense in creating a rolling bevel when I'm not yet aware of where
it will roll. For now it will remain at 29 deg. The rest of the bevels
will be just as drawn, and I hope to avoid the need for further
adjustments. The angle grinder will be at the ready though.

I can hardly wait to be sailing. Around here, very few people sail
during the cold and rainy months. I intend to be the oddity.

I was making templates today and thought I would quit for the night
when I discovered that my rudder template was showing a plumb transom
instead of the rake. I may have simply been getting tired. Will search
the archives for anything related to the rudder plan, and check my
lines again tomorrow.
