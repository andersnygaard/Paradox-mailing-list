Hi Alastair,

Thanks for the quick response. Any day in August would be great (School Holidays), Lunch and beers on me. Not looking for a sail just a look over and then grill you about a few things over lunch if that's OK with you.

I was one of many who spoke to you at Beale Park, you helped with my choosing the Paradox as a retirement boat.

Regards,
Egan
