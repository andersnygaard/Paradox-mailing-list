You need some angle as the 48 measurement isn't vertical. If the bottom had been left square then the cutouts in the bulkheads would have to be varying depths to leave the minimum of fairing. In practice, due to the assembly procedure, it really doesn't matter much.
Don't worry about it, just do it!

I put a picture temporarily in Paul's Files folder in the files section with the area in question (I'll erase it shortly). I understand the bevels, but I am referring to the extra triangular section at the bottom. Like I said perhaps I am looking at it wrong?
