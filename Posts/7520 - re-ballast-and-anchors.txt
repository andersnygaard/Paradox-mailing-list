Subject: Re: Ballast and anchors

I've had excellent results using Bruce anchors...EXCEPT in heavy growth areas. There something pointy like plow or fisherman was needed.

It's time for me to start collecting more pieces for the boat, I start way early so I can maybe get a great deal on Craigslist, eBay or amazon.

What types and sizes of anchors are people using and happy with?

I have a 5kg Bruce. It is probably a bit heavier than necessary but I already had it and it has never given me a moments doubt that it would hold.

Also, how much dead weight are people adding for ballast?

The amount of ballast needed depends on what else you have on board. The 180kg quoted on the plans is presumably for an otherwise empty hull. As you add more anchors, motors, tools, batteries, food, bicycles etc you would reduce the ballast. What is critical is that the boat floats to her lines. Too little weight and she will be tippy, and may not self right. Too much and she will be slow.

I am down to about 50kg of lead at the moment.

Can't say I'm excited about working with, purchasing or adding a couple hundred kilos of lead. I'd much rather use water but I'm thinking there might not be enough room for that.

I don't know what the situation is now, but I got all my lead from a garage in the form of old tyre balance weights. These were classed as hazardous waste so they had to pay someone to take them away. All it cost me was a 6-pack.

If you got the lead in the form of flashing it would be easy to fit it along the rear of bulkhead 3 below the floor, where it would hardly be noticeable.
