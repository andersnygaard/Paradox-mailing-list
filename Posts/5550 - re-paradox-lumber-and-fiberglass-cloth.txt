How wide is is the 4 oz.? You should be able to overlap it if it is too narrow to cover in one go.

The 7 oz. sounds good too, but it will mean more money spent on epoxy in order to fill the weave.

Not familiar with the crows foot or twill weaves, but I like 6 oz. I might be tempted to try samples of each - but then you may be strapped for time that way.
