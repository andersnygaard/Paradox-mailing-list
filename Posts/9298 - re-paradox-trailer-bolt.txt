I have, in fact, upgraded my winch since that photo was taken. My current winch is rated at 950kg, but more importantly it is a braked winch. No fiddling about with the ratchet and no chance of it running away. To haul in wind one way, to let out wind the other and to stop, even under load, just let the handle go.


The back of the trailer is at the back of the boat (when it is on the trailer). The idea was that when the wheels are at the waters edge there is enough water under the back of the trailer for the boat to float. It generally works well.
