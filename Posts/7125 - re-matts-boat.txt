Oh - sorry about that. I was really impressed with Sand Flea and would
like to learn more about it. Although I also know of course that
Wizard's ability has a lot more to do with it than the boat he chooses.
He always seems to be so efficient and never stressed. But he also seems
to prefer a design he can sail from down under cover.
