Subject: Re: Mk I vs Mk II vs 4 sided sprit

In my experiences with my home-made Mk I sail so far I have noticed that in winds less than 10 knots my Paradox slips to leeward so much that my windward distance made good is zero.

Silly me! I've just realised looking through my logs from the last trip that I was sailing up the harbour against the incoming tide when I noticed the leeward slippage. That's what the problem was, not the boat or rig. Duh.

I'm contemplating building a high peaked 113+ sq ft 4 sided sprit sail instead of the MK II, so that I can raise the sail's centre of effort significantly, generating heel in light winds, since I prefer doing my sailing in the early part of the day and to be anchored up by the time the afternoon sea breezes pipe up.

I've made a modification to my Mk I sail that I hope will remove the leech hook that it gets and I've also designed a 4 sided 102 sq ft sprit sail which has it's centre of effort in the same location as the Mk I. I'm going to make and install the sprit sail (not quite true - my wife is going to sew it) over the next couple of weeks and eventually I'll be able to report which I like best.

This is another reason why I like small boats. I can mess about with my Paradox's systems and it costs me next to nothing to do so.
