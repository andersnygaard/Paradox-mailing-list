Subject: Re: Enigma Plans?

Thanks Chris,

I really thought the waters around the world would be dotted all over with Enigmas by now!

I think Enigma was designed carefully to suit Matt as an entrant in an extreme event he wished to win. I'm a bit bigger and heavier than Matt, but am sure Enigma would accomodate me for some pleasurable, laid back cruising. I love that photo of Enigma on his car top! Fact is I'd like, say, three of them for people to independently sail instead of all being on the one larger boat.
