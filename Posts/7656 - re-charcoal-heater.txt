Thanks Jim and John,

I do tend to start new projects before the last ones are finished.  I guess I like starting things better than finishing them.  I'm not planning on rushing right into building the Paradox boat and I am still working on my self-designed one sheet boat currently.  If anyone cares to see what I've been up to with this boat, here's a link to my build thread over at the wooden boat forum.

Yes, I know I'm not building it out of the best materials or the best methods but I'm having fun and learning a lot in the process and that's what I was after with that project.  I'm building my second test sail right now and hope to test it out on the water pretty soon.  It won't be the best sail boat around and might not even work but I won't know for sure until I try it myself.  I'm a lifelong student a t the school of hard knocks.
