Subject: Chine Runners

Just one more note on the shake down cruise, The chine runners on Whisper before re-fit were no where near right. I sailed about a year that way. I took a lot of care and time rebuilding them. The best I can tell I got with in 1 or 2 mm of having them right. It made all the differnce in the world. The time was well spent.
