Just reviewed the files and photo section Paul, I think we can wait a while longer before starting a new group but you have tickled me into thinking maybe it's nearing time to archive some files. I'm also negotiating with a friend to put together a web site where we can store all this stuff. I never expected Paradox builders to grow to the extent it has. Thanks to every one for making this group so enjoyable.
