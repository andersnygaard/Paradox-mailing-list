Dear [recipient],

Thank you for the advice. This is what I have run into, hesitation from local sail lofts about a roller reefing lug.

I have a quote with Sailrite, other than that I have no interest in being a guinea pig for a sail maker. I want it done right as I plan on doing fairly epic journeys while pushing my paradox hard.

Best regards,
Cory
