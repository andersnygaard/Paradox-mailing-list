I would follow Don Elliotts guide for doing this but basically you are using thickened epoxy as your glue, assemble and clamp the various cleats, beams, drill nail holes in from the back. Then use a smallish number of nails into those drill holes it won't split anything with the drill holes there, make the holes just a little smaller than the nail size. The thickened epoxy will get on the drill bit and hammer somewhat. The floor beams will support the floor boards a bit of difference in size I don't think matters to much. Do get a real in detail how to including how to keep the parts from slipping around on the grease like thickened epoxy look at Dons guide.

I am ready to assemble Bulkhead #1

Are the cleats and deck Beam nailed on? In Caseys book it says hammer and drill will get sacrificed! If those part are nailed together THEN epoxy coated how will tools get epoxied?
I am waiting on my Ring nail order to come in. It seems to me nailing the deck beam on May split the laminates apart?

For the 19mm floor timber is it critical to be 19mm? I don't have a planner and have 25/30mm boards, I suppose if it is indeed critical I can plane it down by hand.
