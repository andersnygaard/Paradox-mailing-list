I've been lurking on the outskirts for a long long long time now and after deliberating for over 5 years about possible ways to modify or adjust for my own way of doing things, I've concluded that I will simply build the boat as designed. 

I started work over a month ago casting the lead for the ballast. I've purchased and received Okume plywood from Chesapeake Light Craft which is really beautiful wood. I'll be using MAS epoxy and fiberglass. So far I've got the boat bottom done and scarfed together, bulkheads #2, #3 and the transom done. 

I have the side panels all cut out and ready to create the scarfs and the rudder head halves cut out and ready to route the groove for the lower pintle. I purchased the best quality cypress from a saw mill near Milton, Florida and it is gorgeous knot free in 1X12 and 2X12 by 16 ft. boards. I couldn't get Douglas Fir in my area. 

I'll use the cypress for all solid wood parts and spars. Wish me luck!
