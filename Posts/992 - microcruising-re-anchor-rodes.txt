Hey Glen, thanks for sharing your experience. The sequence of events as you have relayed, is pretty much how I have envisioned. I've also been thinking about how a set of stern anchor rollers on either side of the bow would work (in the position of traditional chocks, with a centerline cleat as far aft as possible). I've used these on other boats, and found that they offer a lot of benefits, though I am ever concerned with weight. They are certainly heavier than a pair of aluminium cleats, so may soon be disqualified from consideration.

I've never had the opportunity to try the nylon single braid. Your testimony mirrors that of many others I have met. That may be the best option for my second rode (if not my first as well), which hopefully would not see regular use. After considerable thought, I have pretty much concluded that a portable reel would present more problems than benefits. However, a mounted reel loaded with webbing still has my attention.

Your story about losing your entire rode overboard in front of an audience made me smile this morning. Funny how the most syncronized, seamanlike manouvers are never witnessed! I once was sailing a small boat on a run, in which I had way to much sail on. As a trick manouver (girls nearby), I thought it would be quite striking to sail between two piles. I calculated enough height for my lifting boom, and only remembered my mainsheet when it snagged a pile, stopping me quite effectively. What a mess. It took forever to free myself from the pile, after great difficulty dropping all sail. The mainsheet was covered in creosote. I must have truly looked the moron. Thankfully, the rig was left intact, though the same could not be said for my pride. Interesting that the smell of creosote actually brings up thoughts of happy times!
