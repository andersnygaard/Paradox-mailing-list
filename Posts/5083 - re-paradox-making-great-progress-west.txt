Its a Mirror Offshore

In the wake of the success of the Mirror Dinghy the same newspaper decided to make a peoples=92 yacht.

So this is a yacht with impeccable socialist credentials.

It is triple keel so it sits very comfortably on the mud, weighs a couple of tons, has the sail area of an Enterprise dinghy so it sails like a pig but has an enclosed loo, full crouching headroom and an 8 hp inboard diesel that makes a surprisingly bearable puckeder, puckeder as long as you let it tick along at four knots.

I am a freelance journalist so am doing the journey between jobs =96 dumping the boat on drying moorings as I work my way around.

The journey may take me three years =96 depending upon how often the phone rings summoning me back to work and home.

In the winter it will sit ashore under a tarp somewhere.

There will be a book called =93keep turning left=94 and I will be posting material on you tube as I go.

The first bit was Bembridge to Rye =96 breaking gear on the 40 year old boat almost every day. So far the gear lever and roller reefing has gone and there is a leak where the echosounder meets the hull. But it coped admirably with this weeks force six.

The next section will be Rye to the Medway =96 where there are more mud berths at =A320 a week in lovely old boat yards.

The reason for the journey is that my son is doing his gap year =96 walking down the Ganges =96 so this is my revenge attack. 

I have also been a sailer all my life and every time I saw the weather forecast f it reminded me that I lived on an island and had never sailed around it.

Compared to the space in a paradox the Mirror Offshore is a spacious, sluggish, bungalow of a boat =96 but a battery and laptop and 3g connection means that I can sail during the day and work in the evenings.

I have been a paradox site lurker for a long time =96 because I think that they are amazing boats and that the people that sail them have more balls than a pornbroker.
