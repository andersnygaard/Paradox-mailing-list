Subject: Entering the Paradox

I'm new to this whole thing.
I've never really sailed and certainly never built a boat.

Any advice or encouragement for a ground-up beginner?

This project has really inspired me, obsessed me even.  I want this boat yesterday, but I can certainly wait a bit longer for everything
to take shape - indeed the "taking shape" part promises to be half the
fun!

I very much enjoy building things, and one of my other projects is to build a scratch-built CAR called a "Locost" basically from steel tubing and an old Toyota truck for donor parts.

Yet another of my projects is a 4-wheeled, 2 seat, recumbent quad cycle, from several old huffy bikes.

If I get to know pedal drive systems well enough, and a Paradox project moves ahead, I may try giving the boat a bit of pedal power instead of the more standard scullery.

I like to break from convention and dream big - this boat is anything but conventional and I think it could be a dream come true.  I love rivers, lakes, and water in general, and I LOVE to get away from it all.  Everything I have read about this sleek little craft makes me want one even more.
