Subject: Gluing sheers and Chines

This is probably one for Glen.

When assembling the sheer strakes and chine logs to the hull how did you go about applying the glue? The process of bending the chine logs into position looks as if it could take some time. If the glue were applied first it could well start to go off. If the glue is not applied first then how do you get it into the joint? What did you do?

Thanks.

Hoping for calm nights
