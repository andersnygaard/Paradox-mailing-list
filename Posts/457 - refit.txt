Hi All,

I'm finishing up the painting today, should launch next week. I have been shooting some video of the refit, and got to thinking, what about getting the shake down cruise on tape? Sailing, cooking, sleeping - to show what cruising in a Paradox is all about. Anybody interested in a copy?

In my part of the country, when you want to sail, the wind never blows, but when trying to paint, the wind blows like hell. Go figure!
