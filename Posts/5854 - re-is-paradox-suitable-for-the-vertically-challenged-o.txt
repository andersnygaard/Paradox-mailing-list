Subject: Re: Is Paradox suitable for the "vertically challenged"? ;o)

Wow, thanks for all the consideration.... seems like other tall folks have worked on the sitting height question. I have looked at other designs as Swaggie. That's a great design BUT I'm really intrigued with the shallow draft and simple design of paradox. It may seem lazy of me, but at my age (65), patience and skill level, Paradox seems much more doable and exciting the way she goes to windward without a centerboard, etc. 

I've owned a west wight potter, shallow draft, flotation, lots of good qualities, .... but probably not as strong and sea worthy as a paradox.

I had to laugh at myself: i checked back and it seems I raised this same issue of head room a couple of years ago on this site....embarassing to say the least ;0)

I'm in Michigan, my daughter is in Minneapolis and I think I heard a paradox was on the west side of Wisconsin or near Minneapolis....obviously it would be best if I could visit one.... have auto, will travel if there is one available for viewing... Most of all thanks for your thoughts, REALLY appreciate them.
