Subject: Aluminum mast - again

I did a quick search on aluminum masts. Has anyone actually fitted one and if so, how was it?  I have a nice piece of old mast with very similar dimensions to the wood one. 

My project is back in build mode after a long break for other projects mainly a house and a trimaran rebuild. 

Unfortunately I'm at the stage where the chine runners, vent trunk and tiller baffle need to be tackled so its all head scratching and slow progress. I've also started work on the rudder stock, not as simple as it first looked.
