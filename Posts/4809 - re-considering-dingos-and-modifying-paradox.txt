Subject: Re: Considering Dingos and Modifying Paradox

Can someone with paradox pics online , tell me there height and weight. I am 6'4" and 270# so the extra room inside would be really nice. Bill

Glen is 5'9" and 185 lb. (He only sails solo as far as I am aware.)
I am about the same size as Glen, but have decided Paradox is too small as I sail with a crew at times. So I chose a Bolger Micro instead. It has two 7' berths.
