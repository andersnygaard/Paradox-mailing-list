Subject: Re: Enigma Plans?

In recently asked the same question on the enigma-as-built-to-plan or some such. Don Elliott replied that Matt was still working on it. and suggested writing to Matt and expressing interest. Somewhere on the list is Matt's address.

I'd like to see/buy the plans also. Altho, from what I can tell, it looks like a smaller version of the Paradox without the fancy inside shelving and with little or no ballast.

I'v often thought of just building a smaller paradox, but I'm trying to finish a Michalak boat, and have ordered plans from himfor a second!
