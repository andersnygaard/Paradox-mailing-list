Subject: Re: Ballasted Chine Runners

I just do not believe you guys.
Why would you want to do these mods when with a little more thought would show they give no positive benefit. In fact they would be a negative.
Internal removable ballast is just that. Removable. 
Makes the boat lighter when removed and easier to move around on land. 
Easier to trim the boat when afloat.
Casting a pair of chine runners in lead would be beyond most boatbuilders let alone an amateur.
Then there is the problem of fitting them as they taper to nothing forward.
Stability would also not be noticeably improved, plus the aft ends of the chine runners are bigger so would be the heaviest the weight the wrong way.
As designed, internal lead ballast is placed forward.

A 3/4" thick steel "wing". 
If this is under the boat it will have to have a gap between hull and "wing". This would increase the draught which reduces PARADOX cruising usefulness and for trailer operations.
This wing would also increase the wetted surface. And you know what that does. Adds drag.
This "wing" Idea is not new and is an option that offer a shallow draught option on a lot of production cruising yachts world wide. 
If designed properly would be of cast construction and a lot smaller, and on PARADOX would increase the draught by about an extra 16 to 18 inches. You would not be able to sail into a shallow bay, dry out and sleep on board as the boat would be likely to topple over or end up resting in its transom with the bow in the air. Most uncomfortable and undignified. 
If the "wings" are fitted to the sides as chine runners this would give the boat a beam of 8 feet.
Both ideas proposed would give no benefit whatsoever, and only go to reduce the usefulness of the design.
