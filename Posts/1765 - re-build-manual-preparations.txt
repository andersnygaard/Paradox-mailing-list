Hi All,

I may be belaboring this point because I have just returned from an errand and have not read all the post yet and may not get through them for another couple of days but I for one can not imagine working without my old $75 table saw but will concede that Paradox could be built with a hatchet and hand saw. Would it be fun? Not for me. Do you need all those tools? No, but having the list in front of you or a least handy, you have a point of departure. Start building and when you come across some thing that you really think you will need and have use for in the future make the decision as to wither you want to add it to your tool chest or not. I want to thank DC for taking the time away from SWASH's building to put the list together and sharing it with us.

Tailwinds

Glen

To all. I've scrutinized the suggested tools list due to Al and David's suggestions of excess. I readily agree that the boat can be built without the need for stationary power tools.

What specific tools do you feel to be unnecessary? I don't feel that a minimal tools list would serve each member, though if there is a concensus regarding the unnecessary inclusion of a specific tool or tools, we can remove it from the list.

BUILD SITE.

Aside from considerations for the builder's physical comfort, this boat can be built where ever the builder chooses. Shelter for the boat and materials should be provided against dew, rain, and airborne debris, such as dust, pollen, spores, etc... This means that at the very least, a tarp strung up between trees could suffice. If the build site has no means of heating or cooling, this must be taken into consideration when purchasing materials such as epoxy, and paint products. Optimally, a garage would be utilized, but this is not absolutely necessary. A dolly or rolling cradle may be employed for moving the boat around, as needed.

TOOLS.

Every builder will encounter different tools needs and preferences, due to experience, and tool availability. Some builders may wish to collect the finest quality tools, while others will make do with tools from the local hardware store. Some builders may wish to assemble a complete tool inventory prior to construction, while others will be satisfied to obtain tools as they are needed. Some builders may wish to construct an entire boat without using a single power tool (not recommended), while others will strive to use a powertool at every opportunity. Thus, this suggested tool list is just that, suggested.
