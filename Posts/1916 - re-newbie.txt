Thanks for the measurements. I sent an email for the plans. I can't wait to get my hands on the plans and maybe get started. I read most of the post on this group in the archives that had interested me. Was wondering if Dan (I think that was his name in S. California) ever got started building his paradox?

Thanks again, 
Todd
