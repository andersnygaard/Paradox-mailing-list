Hi Dc,

Just to make sure I understand, looking at sheet 4 as an example. 
Bulkhead 1 lies at 700mm, and the dimensioned face (as Jim Michalak 
calls them), lies forward of the station line? So it's really the 
outy bevels that we have to calculate from sheet 2 that determines 
the actual dimensions of the bulkhead right at the station lines? No 
wonder inny bevels are so much less confusing.
