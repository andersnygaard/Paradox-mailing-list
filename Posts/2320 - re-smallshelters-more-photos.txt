Nels-Greetings,

When I turn the Hull over I am going to Put Deck screws through the Ply wood into the solid wood strips on the inside of the Hull.Everything else is screwed or nailed--Ply to Wood. Also- I am using a lot of Glue and I put the boards across the Hull-Starboard to Port not Stem to Stern so they don't have to bend either. This is only my second Boat so I am doing a lot of thinking before I actually do the work. I really appreciate your input too, You have very sound Ideas.

Take Care

Dave Blow

"I think deck screws are fine - as are ring nails. I am just a bit curious how you get enough "Purchase" in the plywood - To hold well - when you are screwing the boards to the plywood. The usual practice is to screw the plywood to the solid wood.

Cheers, Nels"
