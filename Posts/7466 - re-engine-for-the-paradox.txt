Subject: Re: Engine for the Paradox


Hi Nels,

yes there are alternatives ways, but to go on a long journey with a Kayak is a hole different story than with a paradox! I got over 100.000 miles in Kayaks, there are small and light, a Paradox is not, 
so it is a different story to go upstream in a fast River with that kind of boat...
I am over 50 now, that's why I want a little Boat where I can sleep in, to much camping out for me the last 25 years.....
Regarding the motor, yes, that's what I thought, or better feared that a 5hp is to heavy....
Regards Chris
