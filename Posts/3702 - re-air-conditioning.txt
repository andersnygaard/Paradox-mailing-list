Hi David,

I would be interested if it will run on 12V or an inverter. I currently hook up to 110v dockside and run my window AC which fit snuggly on the companionway. This Ac is less than $100.00 at Walmart versus the $900.00 marine AC which is mounted on the hatch. Please fill us in on this product.
