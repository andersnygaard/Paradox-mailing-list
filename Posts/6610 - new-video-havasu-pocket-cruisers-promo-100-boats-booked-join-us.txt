Subject: New Video - Havasu Pocket Cruisers Promo - 100+ Boats Booked!! Join us!

Please take a couple minutes to check out the new promo video for the Havasu Pocket Cruisers Convention at: www.sailhavasu.com or on youtube at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3De-3zJGdDQQU 

We now have 102 boats/crews signed up and additional crews flying/driving in. On the website you can see a "participants map" that will show where everyone is coming from, the Meet the Sailors page has bios and photos of many of the boats and crews attending, you can see the seminars that are planned, and on and off-the-water events we have in store. The website is updated almost daily. Lot's more to come. We have 115 days to go to the start. Plan on joining us. The more crews/boats we get, the better event we can put on. 

The group's demographics, when we reached the 100 boat mark looked like this: 

- 100 boats registered 
- 14 States represented 
- 2 Countries represented 
- 535 miles average driving distance (Not counting Hawaii or Lake Havasu City attendees) 
- 39 boat models (all of a particular make and length considered as one model) 
- Most boats of a model - Montgomery 17 - 17 boats (Can't wait to see the class races) 
- Least boats of a model - 29 different boats - 1 boat of that model (The boat show is going to be way cool!) 

I sure can't promise the weather, but I CAN promise you will meet one of the finest, friendliest and most diverse group of folks you could ever imagine. 

If you think you might be shopping for a boat and don't know what boat to buy...COME!!! Fly into Las Vegas, see a show, spend the night, then rent a car for the 2.5 hour drive over to Lake Havasu City. Rent one of the rooms at the resorts (You can get the same great group rates) and mix and mingle with the sailors. Attend some of the seminars, more than likely we can even get you sailing. Check out more trailerable sailboats, in one place, on the water than just about anywhere else. Speak with the folks that sail them to get the "real" info. This is trailer sailor market research at it's best! 

If we get enough people flying into and out of Vegas on the same dates we can probably even arrange a to get a great rate on a shuttle van. Two-bedroom suites with 2 bathrooms, a kitchen, and living room can be booked still for $149/night. Split the room between two couples and MAN! You are staying in a resort, on the water, at the event...for $75/night...and they are NICE rooms! 

Don't want to share a two-bedroom suite, No Problem. The Nautical Inn Beachfront Resort still has room available too right on the cove! 

Come join us Feb 14-21, 2011 We're gonna have a great time....AND NO SNOW!!! Treat yourself to a great winter break! YOU DESERVE IT!!! Drag that boat here, drive here, fly here, walk here....however you need to do it...We want you to come celebrate sailing and friendships with us....What could possibly be better??!!!!! 

See you in 115 days!!
