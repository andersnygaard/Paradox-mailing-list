You think you joke? I did at one time print off some leaflets to 
reduce the explanation time. Last year I found an on-line printer of 
business cards offering 100 free so now I have some with a nice 
picture of Little Jim overlaid with basic information and web 
address. It saves me a lot of time :-)

Anyway, I look forward to taking it out in two or three months, when my time less constrained. The part I
most look forward to is getting a comfortable seat, and just relaxing
and sailing. Scurrying about a deck and tweaking lines etc. is not my
style. 

Take the beer with you, once you get the boat sailing just lay back 
drink and take in the scenery or, as I do, read a book.
