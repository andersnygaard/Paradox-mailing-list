First; over time fiberglass does not completely keep water out. There is most often some water getting in that we are not aware of until the rot sets in. Second; when looking at fairly small boats, the cost differential between marine and exterior grades is not really worth the worry considering the overall project cost and the life of the craft. (IMHO).
Bottom line - I will use marine ply on my current and future boat projects.

I used exterior grade and sheathed the boat in glass, the big difference in todays fiberglass boats is EPOXY, its not the same as your dads Poly also priming and paint are also important, epoxy does not spider crack like the poly of old days...... among other qualitys that are not desired. many have said it before here, use whats the best you can afford!!!
