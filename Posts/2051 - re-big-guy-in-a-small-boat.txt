The idea behind PARADOX is to assure maximum safety by "boxing the sailor in the craft" incase of a knockdown ... By sitting on the aftdeck you are negating these advantages and raising your boat's center of gravity as well (?) ... Would the proper approach consist in verifying if one is comfortable in the prototype, in the three positions (sitting on the helm seat, sitting on a 4 inch cussion on the sole amp; laying on a mattress on the sole), for one or two crew?

If there is a size problem physically demonstrated on a prototype, then perhaps one should build a carboard mockup on the main cabin specifically sized to one's dimensions (single or double crew); Mesure the resulting upscale factors, in lenght, in beam and in hight from the prototype sizes on the original drawings, decide on the lead upscale factor amp; use same for all three dimensional changes to the original drawings; i.e. beam dimensions X "a" factor; hight demensions X "a" factor; lenght dimensions X "a" factor. The decide on the most economical layouts on the sheets of plywood for the cutting oprerations and move on to construct as per plans, adjusting ballast quatity to bring the boat down on its "upscaled" lines" (upscaled design water line) ... It has already been established on this site that at 16 feet in lenght you could retain the original rig demensions with no performance penalty... There are also figures avalible in the files section on upscaling the boat...

I think the boat is worth the effort, since it is such a genial design, wether it is 14, 16 or 18 feet long ...
