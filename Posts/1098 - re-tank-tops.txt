David, I would think that a screw every four inches would be just fine. Have you noticed any flex while sailing whisper?

Hi All,

I need some advice, on the plans it states that the tank tops are structual. I do not use them as water tanks just storage. Do I need to epoxy and screw them down ? or will just screwing them down be ok ? I would like to be able to remove them for inspection. Thanks

David
