Subject: Re: Removable back window for Paradox


The back window could be modified to swing back over the aft deck, very much like a door, except the hinge would be on the lower side.

That's how my Folksong washboard worked. I used it as seat while facing forward and steering at the same time, but I doubt steering Paradox with her internal line steering arrangement could be done.
