Subject: Re: ballast placement

Al has , as usual, shown his good sense and practical
ability and a thorough grasp of the physics
involved,.... while I admit to having a tendency
towards hare brained schemes..;-)

But I still think that my idea has some merit. Perhaps
if one left some leeway for trimming ballast....

Would the extra inertia near the bow and stern cause
problems ?
