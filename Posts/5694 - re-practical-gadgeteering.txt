Al,

About the shallow water. The draft of 16 inches compared to a draft of 9 inches is not so bad I think. The lower unit would just kick-up like a normal outboard motor. If it is not a success then I only have bolt holes to repair. Oh, by the way how deep does the bottom of Bills outboard go down below the waterline?

I don't know for certain, but I think I remember him saying that the hull would ground before the o/b, which makes it less than 9 inches

As to the boarding step. I did not want the drag of it when the rudder is raised and I'm using my poor arms to propel the boat. Also there was something you said once about a plunging sound the water makes when your sleeping on the boat while afloat. In my mind I saw the boarding step plunging up and down as the swells lift and drop the stern of the boat. And also another reason. I have the idea that a ladder or a shelf to sit on when I'm swimming and climbing in and out of the water. It would go on the right side of the transome. I have not made it yet. Free diving is something I aim to get into someday. 

I think the plunging was because the bottom of the transom was out of the water so ripples could slap against the bottom of the hull. Since I loaded the boat up and it sits deeper in the water the noise has not recurred. The step is always completely submerged.
I doubt the drag is measurable at 2 knots.
The shelf idea is interesting.

Hoping for calm nights
