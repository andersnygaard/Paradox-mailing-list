Thanks Deric,

She has certainly provided me with some amazing sailing in places unreachable in conventional boats. The Abrolhos islands are a good example, about 30 miles off shore consisting of hundreds of tiny islands all of which are expressions of large coral reefs in very shallow water. Small Fry with ultra shallow draft was able to sail anywhere (often with the rudder raised to horizontal). Her sturdy bottom meant the possibility of accidental collisions with underwater obstructions were of no consequence, and beach landings could be made anywhere which looked interesting. The picture attached shows Small Fry landed on an island somewhere in the Pelsaert group of the Abrolhos.

Small Fry, Fremantle.
