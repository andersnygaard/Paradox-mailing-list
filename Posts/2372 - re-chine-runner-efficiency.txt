I don't think chine runners will work as well on a dory hull as a sharpie hull. The closer the angle is to 90 degrees between the sides and hull bottom the better the effect.

I bet that is why Sven Yrvind does not use them as his boats have slacker bilges.

Centerboard or fin keel is the best for a dory hull.
