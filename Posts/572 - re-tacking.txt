Hi David;

Have you tried falling off (pointing further away from the wind) to gain
some speed before trying to tack?

You might also be down by the head - do you have a lot of stuff up in the
bow? This can cause a boat to miss stays (I think that's the correct term)
:)

P.S. Did you happen to name your boat after Hal Roth's?
