Robb, 

Yep, that's how I read it. I don't know for certain that I did it right but this is what I did. I made my bend to be from the pivot-ish area to each end. The trouble with this is that there is springiness to the wood. When I clamped the layers of wood together with the bow built into the clamping system and some glue, I guessed I would deflect them at maybe 60mm. I sighted over both ends of the yuloh and a little wood block made 60 mm high just to sight over which I put near the pivot zone. After the glue cured and I unclamped it I saw that the springback was more than I wanted and I ended up with less tham 30mm. 20 mm is about what I got. As soon as launch the boat and try to use the yuloh I will know something. That is if I ever learn how to use a yuloh. Something of a paradox huh? I curious to hear what the oldtimers have to say too.

Good Luck, Steve Yahn
