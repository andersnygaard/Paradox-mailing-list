Hi Alberto

Sorry that you've had a poor summer.
I understand the need for a bowsprit to give clearance from the mainsail and if you have more photos of your jib in use we'd all find it interesting.

The secrets of my new sail?=A0 Mainly, it's important to get the right amount of camber in the right place so that the sail forms an ideal aerofoil section. Our=A0 Paradox sails should be shaped with more camber further forward than is normal with a sloop mainsail=A0 because we have=A0 no jib to cause back-winding and slot effect. 

If you use a jib the mainsail camber should be less and further aft to avoid back-winding.

The windward performance depends largely on air flow over the 1st third of the sail's width.=A0 Maybe you can find an on-line=A0 technical=A0 explanation in Spanish=A0 of=A0 sail=A0 aerodynamics which will explain better than I can. Pay attention to 'lift/drag ratio' , 'centre of pressure',=A0 'upflow'..and=A0 'slot effect.'.

But our boats are low-tech with a low aspect ratio cruising rig,=A0 not racers,=A0 so we mustn't expect too much.

Hope this helps.

Best

Jim

Hello Jim
I could not taste much the jib as this summer has been very stingy. What I have noticed is that I put a bowsprit to carry forward a little to not enriede with the mainsail.
I've sailed with the jib alone and
 responds very well.
I will keep you informed when making new evidence.
And if you can tell me what are the little secrets of your new candle.
Best Regards
Alberto

Hello Alberto

My new sail was made here in the UK by a local sail-maker.=A0 Mainly,=A0 he followed the=A0 instructions given in the files section of the paradoxbuilders site , but being used to making unusual and 'traditional' sails he included a few of his own little tweeks here and there.

BTW, There is a photo on the paradoxbuilders site of your boat with a a jib. Could you tell us how that worked out for you?

Best

Jim

Jim, you took the words out out my mouth:) 

Folks will spend hundreds on an outboard but use a tarp and expect the boat to sail like a champion:( 

I don't have a Paradox but love the little boat and will build one someday. I don't know how he deviated from Matts plans, but I'm building a Wharram catamaran right now and am shocked at the builder modes to his design. I know it's hard to stick to the plans but that's probably the best course.

There is an interesting letter on Jim Michalak's web site  about a Paradox owner who wasn't happy with  the performance, fitted a lee board and reckons it is a great improvement.

Not much detail. From the picture it can be seen that he has made  some design changes during construction, whether any of them are significant to the sailing performance is not clear.
