Subject: Re: Bigger Paradox

Hi Roberto, 

sorry but your Google translation is very hard to understand...
I think you ask why I ask amateurs in a forum for advice.
Very simple, thy have a Paradox and have the experience and some do know how to build boats!
But, if I had listen to all the advice from Professionals, non of my expeditions would have happen....
I trust good knowledge amateurs more then , the so called professionals.
Every professional told me my ORCA for the 2007 Expeditions would not make it, but as you see, she was perfect, thanks to the advice of some very knowledgeable amateurs...
And as I mention, a Boot Building Master from Germany will help me, so I think everything will be OK, but it is never wrong to ask people for advice, one just has to filter the answers......
I know what Boat would be good for my way of travel
Regards Chris
