DC, found your post very interesting as I have been considering building an 18ft sharpie based closely on a Bolger design, but with chine runners rather than leeboards. When I get around to it(it will be a while since I just finished a dinghy cruiser based on Herreschoffs "Marco Polo Tender" design), I plan on using 1/4 inch steel plates bolted and bedded underneath the hull, and extending the appropriate profile outboard in the chine runner shape. I thought of this for much the same reason as your lead fillet idea, but the advantages would be that the weight is as low as possible, and an incredibly tough edge protection. Tentatively, the part extending under the hull itself would be about 10 in wide, It would either be faired into the bottom or rabbeted in flush. These plates could be temporarily bolted on with mold release or saran wrap type plastic on the protruding edge while an epoxy based fillet is molded on.

Good luck    
Mike
