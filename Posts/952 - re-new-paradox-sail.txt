Another thing to consider when making a new Paradox sail is the weight of the sailcloth. We used Sailrite's 3.9 oz red dacron for Little Cruiser which proved adequate, but for our next sail we will use the same 4.5 oz sailcloth that Matt employed in his Paradox sail. I think it will prove to be more durable and stretch resistant. The 4.5 oz cloth is available from Defender Industries for a reasonable price.  Also, for those of you out there who are new to sailmaking you might want to take a look at our webpage on the subject to get a rough idea of what is involved.
