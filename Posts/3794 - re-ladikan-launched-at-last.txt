Congratulations Bengt! Your boat is a beauty. I too did not put in a water tank. How much ballast did you use?

Subject: Ladikan launched at last

A couple of weeks ago my Paradox hit the water for the first time. It has taken me two years of learning, problemsolving and carpentry. Two fine years. I call her Ladikan which is an old swedish word for the little box. (spelled with two dots above the first a). As you can see on pictures in the photos section I have modified the cabin. It is in two parts, the aft part movable. No longer young and agile I was worried about getting in and out of her. That's not the only deviation from plan. For instance I have used screws instead of ring nails which I couldn't get hold of. And I have excluded the water tanks and the lightning protection. I'm in favor of simple not to say rude solutions and I don't care much about finish. But this group, your messages and pictures have been a source of inspiration for me. Thank you all! For instance I've tried to copy Zero's wooddesign of reefing/furling gaff. So far I have not had the opportunity to test Ladikans sailing capacaty. I have launced her a couple of times in the lake Malar but unfortunately (?) we have a stable high pressure weather with hardly no winds in the inland. But she behaves very reassuring in the water. I had her weighted on the trailer without ballast and the equipage weighted only 420 kilogrammes. Minus the trailer it should be around 300 kg. My leadpigs had to be made up with sandbags to get her down to the DWL. I'm not yet used to my digital camera and to sending photos on internet but I can see that my first tr=EDal has landed. I have some more pics from the building process if anyone is intersted.
