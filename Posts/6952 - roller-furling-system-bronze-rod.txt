Subject: roller furling system/ bronze rod

This question is for all those who have bent the rod for the roller furling system. How did you do it? Did you do it yourself? Did you have a professional make it? If so, what kind of shop did it? I've done everything else myself, but am leaning toward having someone else make this part.
