Subject: Re: Best shape for Chine Runners?

More interesting reading about the use of chinerunners but on aviation. 

If you google "49er performance enhancement report" you will find a PDF that is interesting. They try to maximize flow separation by making the chines as sharp as possible. The chinerunner is a "supersharp" chine - with a sharper shape than a regular 90 degree chine. 

Cheers,
