Hello All,

My paradox is showing signs of wear and needs a major refit. One of her biggest problems is the aft (not to plan) drop-board. I actually love the feature, but it's not the best setup. The cabin aft ends up terminating on the plywood deck with no reinforcement. On my boat, there are fine stress cracks around where the drop board hatch is located. There is/was no easy fix. I had to cut off the nice wooden handholds and had to remove the side windows too. Ultimately I'll need to do lots of work to make this right but my question today is:

There is a ton of 100 percent silicone calk under where the windows were. My gut feeling is that I'll have to scrape the majority off, then sand the rest. I'm hoping someone out there has some magic beans type process that makes all this nasty silicone stuff go away?
