Dave,

Compared to Paradox, how did Little Cruiser tack and point, with no chine runners but with a "bow-mounted centerboard"?  Was the extra complexity of a centerboard worth any other advantages it had compared to a Paradox design?

Paradox acts like a long keeled boat and she has quite a large rudder to boot so I'd recommend gently nudging her over through her tacks. When I was sailing Matt's original boat, I experienced this problem initially because I was just slamming the rudder over like what I would do in my Blue Jay classday sailer. Then I watched him sail from inside the cabin, and I noticed he was moving the tiller much slowly then me. When I did it his way the boat sailed much better.  Since then I have used this method on LC and ENIGMA and have only had problems if I was moving too slowly or I had a strong head wind and short chop. Therefore, try to do your tacks when you are moving and move the tiller over slowly when tacking.
