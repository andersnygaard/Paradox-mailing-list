Subject: Any Paradox's near Dallas Texas ?

Hello everyone,

I was just wanting to know if anyone near Dallas Texas is building a Paradox. I have my plans and will begin building soon to build but would like to see one first. I do alot of long distance moto travel so if anyone is in the usa who would let me look at there paradox I would like to come take a look at it on one of my future bike trips.

Regards,

Wayne
