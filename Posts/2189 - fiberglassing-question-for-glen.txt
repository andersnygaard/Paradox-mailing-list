When you fiberglassed Zoe, what weight glass did you use to reenforce the chines after you applied the woven roving on the bottom and the 6 oz glass on the sides. It's apparent in the ground plate installation pictures that you did a beautiful job fairing all the different weights of fabrics together.  

Thanks,

Dave
