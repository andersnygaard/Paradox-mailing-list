Subject: Re: Boat Rollover

Hi Steve,

I rolled mine over the first two times on some old garbage bags filled with Christmas wrapping paper! But your idea with the boat trailer tires sounds much safer. I might have to try that instead.

I was thinking of making a couple of frames, but it seems like most of the work involved is just getting the boat on and off the trolley. I have friends who could come over and help, but they usually end up drinking all my beer and nothing gets done for the rest of the day...

Best regards,
Pete
