Subject: Re: Building Started on Irene May

I am happy for you. Because for me, this time when you have the raw materials for a project, but not any work accomplished, is the most beautiful. Because there is ahead of you the perfection of a dream made physical. The "process" of boat building is an adventure. Any really good story always involves a boat or ship. So, here it is, that we test our wits and our courage in a test of ourselves. It may seen silly, in a way but a tiny boat can scare you just as completly as anything bigger, if not more. Good Luck,
Steve

P.S. As a little boy I told my mother that when I grew up I would name my boat MARTHA LOUISE. My mothers name.
