Subject: Re: Roller reefing hull attachment?

Hi Bill,

I have seen recently on You Tube someone demonstrating furling and unfurling exactly this system, on a PDracer, but haven't managed to re-find it!! Suggest you ask a question on the PDracer group, and someone will know who it was...
Cheers,
Alan.
