thanks Al

Rowlock that's the word I was looking for :0)


If you mean an ordinary rowlock then be aware that there is high likelihood of tangling with the sheet, which may lift it out, and there will be significant wear on the oar, so good leathers are needed. But many people scull using a rowlock. 

If a rowlock socket is fitted it would be easy, later, to drop in the designed pin (or some other system) if the rowlock was unsatisfactory.


Questions: Is there any reason why I can't mount the yuloh in a standard oar socket? Has anybody any knowledge of the respective merits of 2hp Honda and Suzuki outboards?

Cheers  ...  Derek
