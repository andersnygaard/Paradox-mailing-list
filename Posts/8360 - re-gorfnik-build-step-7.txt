Subject: Re: Gorfnik build Step 7


Brian, on Gorfnik I think keeping the cabin as small as possible is very important because it reduces windage to a minimum. As you will soon see, the space on deck will be used to store the hatch when sailing in fair weather. It's also a spot to put muddy boots, it's the cooking surface, anchor is also stored there. As designed, I believe the cabin size to be just right as a compromise between forward accessibility and cockpit room versus windage reduction. The cabin height at 15 inches is also important to prevent excess windage and to give standup paddling or yulohing possibilities. More to come.
