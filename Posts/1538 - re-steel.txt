One more thing about steel construction: The recent introduction
of low-cost plasma cutters makes cutting out the plates for a steel
boat as simple as using a magic marker. You could literally cut ALL
the steel plates out in less than an hour once you laid them out. You
could also get someone in a muffler shop to cut them out for you
because most muffler shops now have plasma cutters. A $100 for time
and cutter consumables would be more than fair. Sheet steel can be
found in your yellow pages.

Finishing: Most steel boat fabricators do not use epoxy top coats.
They use good old red oxide primer and a reasonable quality paint
over it.
