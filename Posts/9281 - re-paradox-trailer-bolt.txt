Hi Nick and Al, 

Glad to hear folks are still sailing, testing, and reporting back on this post.

I shall try the one line approach as well; my halyard is thicker line than the furling, so I think I am ready to go with the halyard size for the furling line as well.

It is getting colder here in Central New York USA, and I have been thinking about starting the paradox projects. Too many to list here.

The topping lift started out as a good idea for me until I had a mess in some good wind. I do have the half topping lift and it works pretty good to help align the front of the boom. I still wish the furling was easier. It is not as difficult as it was the first few times I used it. My technique is better. There are some minor adjustments I need to make.

Love to read the updates and posts. Keep it coming.
