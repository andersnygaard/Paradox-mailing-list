Chris,

Another mod I'd like to make is to terminate the mast on the top deck and use "little cruiser" type mast braces. I'm also thinking about setting it up so the mast can fold down between posts (I'm sure there is some nautical name for these things!).

What type of sail are you planning to use and what is the area of the sail?
