Hello all.

Nice one Glen, I have pinned up your picture of Zoe in my garage to remind me where I am heading.

Having finished all the bulkheads on my Paradox I have gone into semi-hibernation for the winter. I shall start the hull assembly in the spring when I can move around outside more comfortably.

In the mean time I am doing some of the smaller jobs, spars and rudder etc. I am nearly ready to close up the mast and I wondered what the general opinion was concerning sealing the wood inside. Should I give it a coat of epoxy or will it be better left uncoated? I have come up with arguments both for and against, but am not too sure how valid they are. So, what is the general opinion out there?

Hoping for calm nights
