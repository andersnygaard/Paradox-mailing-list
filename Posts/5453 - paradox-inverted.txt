Subject: Paradox inverted?

Hi,

Been thinking about what might happen to an upside-down boat, perish the thought! Any views on how the turnbuckles would cope with this, or even with a 90 degree knockdown, especially if really heavy items were under the floor?

Also, wondering about water getting in. Even if the stern vent is closed, air can escape thru the mast-drain, thus letting in water through the cabin-hatch (if its under the surface). If the drain wasn't there, or was closed somehow, there might(?) be an airlock which would minimize that happening. Depends also on where the tiller-opening is relative to the surface I suppose...

Cheers,
Alan.
