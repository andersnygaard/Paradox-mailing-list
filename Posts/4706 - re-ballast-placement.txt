Subject: Re: ballast placement

The usual practice with ballast is to keep it near the centre of the boat longitudinally so as to maintain buoyancy in the bow and stern. This makes for a sea-kindly vessel. I believe Matt got it absolutely right. The ballast in 'Faith' is fitted according to Matt's plan and I have found no need for adjusting it (Including the water ballast which is situated right in the middle of the boat).
