Phil,

The cheapest I could find was Robbins Timber
http://www.robbins.co.uk/mar_fixings.htm

However I was lucky enough to buy most of mine at a VERY good price 
from Bill who had surplus stock.

Why did he have surplus? 
Because he found that the amounts quoted on the plans were way over the 
top.
I took his advice and have the same quantities that he used and it 
looks like it will be spot on.
The details are as follows:

25mm # 14 =3D 250gms    
32mm # 12 =3D 500gms    
38mm # 10 =3D 500gms    
50mm # 10 =3D 750gms    
65mm # 8 =3D 250gms

That probably represents a substantial saving on the quoted amount!
HTH
