I'm very happy with my fresh water pump-in pump-out system. Works like a charm and takes about 10 minutes to fill or empty. These days I fill the tanks at home, because the boat tows a little better with weight in the ballast tanks and it's one less thing to worry about at the boat ramp. I usually empty the tanks before haul out though, just to make the boat a bit lighter to haul up on it's trailer.

Following the pump-out, I have to wipe the bottom of the tanks to get the last of the water out (1 cup of water from each tank). They don't have any kind of lining, just the epoxy cloth specified in the plans with silicone sealant in a few places where I didn't get a perfect seal when installing the floor with the deck plates in it. Wanda must be a shorter woman with correspondingly shorter forearms. I can only just get my elbow through with 5" deck plates. The problem is getting your arm to twist in the right direction as you push your arm through. I think it is vital to be able to get your hand everywhere inside the ballast tanks. I've also used a mirror through the deck plate to look around inside the tanks.

I would never contemplate filling the tanks with sea water. They are my emergency supply. I use water bottles for my drinking water, but if I was at sea, it's a real comfort to know that in a pinch there's at least 20 litres of fresh water available, without upsetting the boat's balance. To be fair, I've never tried to drink out of the ballast tanks, so I don't know what it would taste like, but I imagine it would be OK for at least a couple of weeks before becoming undrinkable.
