It is possible we are just bantering around ideas.  That in itself is not a bad idea.  

I agree that trying to ballast the chinerunners would be a large extra outlay of work without clearcut benefit.

I don't think you understood my "wing" idea clearly at all.  After reading your comments, I know you don't understand.   The "wing" would bolt directly under the paradox and provide a shorter and higher aspect ratio runners.  Matt Lyden's new boat enigma also has narrower, and higher aspect "wings".   Correctly added to the boat, there would be NO additional draft.   And again, you would get a lot of ballast down very low and in the middle, right where you want it.  Lastly, you would benefit from being able to "tune" the runners by making them longer than you think you need, and via testing, shortening them down until you find an optimal setting (or just guess!!).

Ether way, banter is healthy and critical to the survival of a species.  If the (US)"leader" would have discussed things with the people around him (in an open and honest way), he would not have started and lost a war killing tens of thousands with NO benefits and no positive outcomes.
