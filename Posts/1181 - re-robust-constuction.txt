Hi Jay. I agree with you. I think that a trip to the maritime museum
would help with the desire to overbuild a perfectly good design.
Actually, I think that what would be even better would be a trip to an
air and space museum. Looking at the old flying machines of yesteryear
will inspire anyone to practice more sound engineering. The rigging
and surfaces of the old planes are absolutely incredible! There is a
balance to which I think we could all aspire: efficiency.

You know the old film of the guy wearing crude wings jumping off of a
cliff only to immediately hit the dirt? well, that's because he
ordered, 'MORE FEATHERS DAMMIT! GIVE ME MORE FEATHERS!' Kidding.

Seriously though, I wonder how many experimental aircraft builders
tamper with building plans. "Yeah, I couldn't afford the alloy spars,
so I just went with the electrical conduit".

Back to boats. I recommend anyone who doubts the strength of a
particular boat to spend a few hundred bucks and build their choice of
Platt Monfort's Geodesic Aerolite boats. It's a good project for the
winter time, and is sure to inspire confidence in good design.

The 12mm hull sides of the Paradox design are not the least bit
troublesome to wrap around the bulkheads. Of course 9mm should suffice
for nearly any situation, but the boat was designed for 12mm. Like I
said in a previous post, she would be a cinch in aluminium, but alas,
she was designed for plywood.

I agree with you 100%, that it is better to buy the best quality
materials specified in any design, rather than double up with poor
quality. Good materials really are the cheapest part of the
construction of any boat.
