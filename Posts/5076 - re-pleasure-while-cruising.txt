Well, we can't have everything we want, can we?  My weight limits are pretty much absolute, if I want to have lively performance, so I suppose I'll have to be content with as much luxury as I can squeeze out of a small battery.

I can run a Walkman on dry cells, and my GPS is the same.  You can get a couple of movies from a portable DVD's internal battery-- enough for a three-day weekend.  Fishfinders can be run on dry cells too, and a compass light takes little power.  I may convert my running lights to LED.

And I'll still have an occasional burst of power to burn out the eyeballs of unwary towboat pilots.  (Kidding, sort of.  They've done that to me so many times that it's pleasant to return the favor, though my zillion-candlepower searchlight is feeble compared to theirs.)
