I have been hashing around an odd idea. I want to have a 2 HP honda outboard fitted to my Paradox. I already have one is why. And my hands are too old and sore for yuloing. Anyway if I mount the motor on the transom it will be very hard to reach, and refill, etc. I don't want to fit a removable panel to the cabin aft end. I like the cabin just as Matt has it. 

So I think it might be mounted outside, to the lefthand side of the hull near the No. 4 bulkhead. I would make some small clips to hold the motor mount so it could be dismounted and stored inside when not needed. The 27 pound honda engine would store inside too. In the rear area. I could start, refuel and adjust throttle, all while standing inside the hatchway. The thrust from the off center position would result in the need to turn the engine a bit to starboard to get the hull to go straight. I'm willing to give up some efficiency for handiness. 

So is this going too nutty? If anyone would care to comment I would appreciate it very much.
