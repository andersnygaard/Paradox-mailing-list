Subject: ECHO SOUNDER

Dear Friends,

These days a friend traveling to Miami and needs an echo sounder. I was hoping that one of you could tell me where to find one that is economic or used in good condition. It can be analog or digital. Alternatively, if any of you in the group have one to sell, please let me know.

Thank you very much.
