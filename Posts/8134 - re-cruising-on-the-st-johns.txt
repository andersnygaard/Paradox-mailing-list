Hello Andre. Thanks for the nice post about your recent Paradox trip. I'd like to ask a few questions if I could. It looks like you bought Steve's boat? Did you drive all the way to the PNW to purchase it, or did it make it's way to Florida before purchase? I was saddened by Steve's passing. He was always fun to talk to and offered for me to come and see his boat many times during the build. 

How did you feel in the Paradox crossing the lake in 30 kts? Did you feel confident, or was it a bit much? Lastly, you said the iPad mini doubled as a radio. Are you talking about streaming media, or does the Mini actually receive FM?

I recently purchased a Paradox and I'm very anxious to sail her. I have an Enigma too (e460) which I have sailed many times but I'm really excited to sail the dox. I expect her to be slightly slower, but an overall better boat (because she is on a more human scale). Thanks for the post again, it really helps to keep up the anticipation for all of us still on the sidelines.
