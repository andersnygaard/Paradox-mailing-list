What a concept! Great link Steve, thanks. Just when I thought that my vane steering gear would be my last major project for Raffles I now have another idea to think about. I have found that using the yuloh requires almost windless conditions and a lot more skill and patience than I currently possess while my cruise'n'carry has its own problems. Do you have any thoughts about optimum prop size? The main problem I am having a hard time getting my head around is how to get the main power to the prop with making any major compromising holes. Perhaps a series of universal joints could be aligned so that only one hole coming up through the aft deck would be necessary.
