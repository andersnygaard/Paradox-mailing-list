Subject: Re: Tack Strop Fork

Hi Derek,

Your strut looks good.

The 15mm pipe is plenty strong enough (as straight pipe). It was when I split it that it became too flimsy

I made a tapered punch to spread the other end and then curled it back on itself with a small hammer (to produce a rolled edge) so that it didn't cut into the deck.

A couple of pics of the Enuf (I hope) tack strop fork in the Enuf Folder.

I silver soldered an extra bit of brass plate across the forks this afternoon. I made a little forge by stealing the fire bricks out of the fire place and putting them in a biscuit tin. Used a lot less gas to get to enough heat.

I think Al is using 15mm copper water pipe but if it isn't strong enough I will try slitting another length and forcing it over the current one before soldering them together.

ps I know it needs cleaning up but I start back to work tomorrow and my trousers need pressing.

Hoping for calm nights
