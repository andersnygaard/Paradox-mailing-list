For the sort of cruising Al and I did to the Scillies there was ample storage space.  I never used all the space in the forepeak and I had room for the stowage of my bower anchor and a two gallon can of drinking water on the starboard side forward in the cabin.  I made a special stowage rack for the bower.  In truth I never needed the spare can of water, since I had a similar one with a pump in the lazarette.  Al and I could replenish our water supply at least every second day.

I found the way things were arranged for storage aboard 'Faith' just about ideal.

I wouldn't change anything, except perhaps to do away with the ridge formed by bulkhead #2 into the forepeak, as Al has done for the storage of his folding bicycle.  The removal of the ridge would make getting into the forepeak easier.  I need to go there now and again to check out the battery and if necessary top it up with distilled water. I do this with a pipette which means I do not have to remove the battery.

When I arrived back after the Scilly cruise there were lots of cans of food left in the stowage compartments under the floor.  I also stored perishable foods like rice, biscuits, cereals and chocolate in plastic containers under the floor.  The only time a meagre amount of water got there was when it was extremely cold and it came about through condensation - my boat does not have foam lining on the hull, which may have made a difference.
