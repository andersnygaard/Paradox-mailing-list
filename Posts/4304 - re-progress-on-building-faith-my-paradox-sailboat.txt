Hello Bill

bearings where there is some  sliding friction work better if there are dissimilar materials involved.

Hence your motorcar crankshaft made of a hard material (steel) running in a soft metal bearing (tin/lead etc)

So I'd guess that a stainless steel ball working within a copper cup would be a reasonably good plan.

Or, the stainless ball in self lubricating epoxy which the others have mentioned. You don't really want to use messy old grease, there do you?
