Hi Al,
    
One of the things I considered was a drift boat type trailer, you might want to do a web search for info on them. I know that they launch them into very shallow rivers from the banks. Another thing to consider would be using torsional axles as they are mounted independently from each other and would allow the bottom of the boat to be below the axle.
