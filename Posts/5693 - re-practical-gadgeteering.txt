Al. About the shallow water. The draft of 16 inches compared to a draft of 9 inches is not so bad I think. The lower unit would just kick-up like a normal outboard motor. If it is not a success then I only have bolt holes to repair. Oh, by the way how deep does the bottom of Bills outboard go down below the waterline?

As to the boarding step. I did not want the drag of it when the rudder is raised and I'm using my poor arms to propel the boat. Also there was something you said once about a plunging sound the water makes when your sleeping on the boat while afloat. In my mind I saw the boarding step plunging up and down as the swells lift and drop the stern of the boat. And also another reason. I have the idea that a ladder or a shelf to sit on when I'm swimming and climbing in and out of the water. It would go on the right side of the transome. I have not made it yet. Free diving is something I aim to get into someday.
