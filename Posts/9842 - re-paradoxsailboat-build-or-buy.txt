Subject: Re: [paradoxsailboat] Build or buy

I plan on starting my Paradox build in late November.  I would like to add an outboard.  Does anyone have any experience with installing an outboard on Paradox?

Very difficult to find a Paradox for sale, one comes up every couple of years.  I just finished building an Enigma, took me 4 1/2 months at an average of 4-5 hours a day. Mind you I had no plans and there was a lot of thinking time.  Took me a month to finish the inside of a Paradox.  Even if I have built several boats, I think it would still take me at least 6 months to build a Paradox. The cost for my Enigma was over $3000 without the trailer.  Paradox will cost more than that just for materials and sail.  Buying is by far the best option, at any price, if you can get your hands on one. I drove from the East Coast of Canada to the West Coast of the United States to get mine- and I am still convinced it was easily worth the 5 grand I paid plus the 12000 km trip!
