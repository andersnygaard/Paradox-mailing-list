Hi Phil

In these days of very high prices for all metals 27 quid per kilogramme doesn't seem too bad. Remember it is bronze you're talking about here, which has always been one of the most expensive metals used for constructing things.

While I'm on here, can someone explain why barbed ring nails are preferred to bronze wood screws?
