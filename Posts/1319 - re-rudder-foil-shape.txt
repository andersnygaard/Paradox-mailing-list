From what I understand - the rudder as designed is superior to an 
airfoil shape. That is because it gives more effect at the slower 
speeds that a Paradox would mostly be operating in.

Too much taper at the trailing edge makes for poorer control at slow 
speeds and more likelihood of damage. The eddies actually help to 
swing the stern over!
