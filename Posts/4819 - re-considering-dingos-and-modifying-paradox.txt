Hi Glen,

I have always been intrigued with the PEEP HEN design but have never been 
able to find a photo of one sailing. Motoring with the sail just flapping 
does not count.
How well do they sail and could you post any photos of one sailing?

Actually, I do sail with others on occasion and for that I have a 14ft
Peep Hen for quick getaway and delightful sailing. If you haven't
noticed this design by Rubin Train, you owe it to yourself to check it
out. We now have 4 of them in our family. When I first sailed my brother
Greg's I couldn't believe how such a broad beamed short boat could sail
so well. As for room, compared to a paradox, it is a palace.

Glen is 5'9" and 185 lb. (He only sails solo as far as I am aware.)

I am about the same size as Glen but have decided Paradox is too small
as I sail with a crew at times. So I chose a Bolger Micro instead. It
has two 7' berths.
