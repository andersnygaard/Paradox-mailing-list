Subject: Sarah Rules!

Just had a phone call from Gordon Lamb of Robbins (boss of Sarah Suck Teeth) and he is not happy that they sent me a piece of obviously weak wood.

From SmallSailBoats just this morning:
Best just not to tell them. It's not like you're erecting a squatters cottage on his lordships land.

Boy, Derek, are you ever on this morning. I truly feel you've missed your calling as a writer all these years, as you slaved away in someone's refrigerated, electronics room in TV land.

"Sarah Suck Teeth" is rich.
