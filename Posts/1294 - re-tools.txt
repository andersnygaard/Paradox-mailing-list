There is one tool that I find makes my life much more enjoyable for shaping complex boat parts:

A Nicholson pattern makers rasp will give a much smoother surface than an ordinary version or the Surfform rasp mentioned. They come in a couple sizes (get the big one-first) and have one flat and one convex side. The teeth are made in a random pattern so there is very little or no "grooving" cut into the work. With good pressure, It will cut aggressively and with light pressure, it will leave a surface about equivalent to 50 grit sandpaper. Very little cleanup is necessary. Great for complex shapes such as Kayak coamings or perhaps those chine runners on a paradox.

These are fine tools, the kind that kind that give the warm feeling you get when using a really well tuned plane, lacking only that sharp little <snick> sound the plane will make. They were designed for craftsmen who made wood patterns for castings in foundries.

The downside-they might be hard to find and they are not cheap. I paid $20 US about 25 years ago for mine, so get a file card to keep it and your other files clean. You won't regret it.

The most used power tools were the drill, jig saw and angle grinder.

Here are the tools that I used with some comments added.
