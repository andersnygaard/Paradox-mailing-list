Subject: ECHO SOUNDER

Dear Friends,

These days a friend traveling to Miami and needs an echo sounder. I thought that someone in this group could tell me where to get one at an affordable price or used but in good condition. It can be analog or digital.

Alternatively, if anyone in this group has one to sell, kindly let me know.

Thank you very much.
