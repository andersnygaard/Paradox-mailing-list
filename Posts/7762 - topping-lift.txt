Subject: Topping lift
Date: Fri, 06 Dec 2013 19:07:02 -0800

Me too Pete, like Al, I'm really interested! I consider myself a relatively strong individual, and without the topping lift, it's easy to get the sail up, but I can barely handle bringing it back down again. The last time I was out, the wind was on and off, and I put the sail up and back down again at least a dozen times in an hour. I was exhausted, even with the topping lift. Don't think I would have managed without it.

I'd really like to know how Matt Layden does it. Can't believe he's that much stronger that I am, so what's up? Ahh, perhaps it's technique, or, what I am missing here?

All comments from those with experience will be much appreciated!
