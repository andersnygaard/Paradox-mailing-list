Subject: Re: Plywood for Paradox

Are you going to wait for a few of the other guys to offer their opinions before you go out and buy the stuff?

I am waiting for my plans to arrive so I can begin working on my Paradox. I have read several past post on the different types of plywood that can be used for the Paradox but none really answered my questions. If I use the cheaper plywood not the marine stuff will I have to use more epoxy resin than if I used better wood. How long should the cheap exterior ply hold up compared to marine grade. Also, at my local hardware store the only exterior plywood they sell is green in color is this the correct type of wood to use? And does anyone know where I can get cheap Epoxy Resin?
