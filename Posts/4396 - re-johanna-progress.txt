And if it then turns out to be a bit flimsy, perhaps it could keep its original name - 'Wiggle' !!
Cheers,

Hi Pete. If I am not careful you will be afloat before me :-) 
Looking at your dry assembly, I don't see why you could not build her stitch and glue with two layers making up the bottom panel or even just one thickness of 1/2". My way of thinking in giving NOLI only a 3/8" thick bottom was that the original wooden  West Wight Potter had an even wider bottom and yet only had a hull thickness of 5/16" and these boats were designed to do the same things as PARADOX. Just a thought.

But there is something very comforting about that 22mm thick bottom, especially when I see others floundering around checking there are no rocks where they want to dry out.
