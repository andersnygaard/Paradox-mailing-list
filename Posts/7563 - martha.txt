Subject: Martha

Hello everybody,

I would like to announce my intentions to build a Paradox boat. She will be called Martha.

At this point, I am VERY early into the build. I have the building guide and am eagerly awaiting the plans that might come in a week or two (or three). I am a first-time boat builder, although I have participated in kayak builds and have built one on my own if that counts.

I am also kind of new to sailing, having had a 13-year break from it that I have somewhat regretted the whole time. I didn't do much sailing back then either but am really looking forward to it.

I live in Sweden, so most of the please-help-me posts will probably be due to the language barrier. My spoken English is ok, but I am having problems with (especially American) colloquialisms. I even had to look up what brass brads were. I recognized them immediately when I saw them; guess that was one of those Rumsfeldian unknown knowns.

And if there is any Swedish Paradox builders out there, I would love to correspond. I know there is at least one of you :)

Best regards to all,

Christian Skjutare.
