That's really not too bad, if I could get most of the bulky stuff done and still be around 350 lbs I think I could get some help to slide her over a few 5ft walls! :)

Also, what can I expect to be the most time consuming process in the hull construction? I may go down the kit route if this pre cut version comes along in time.
