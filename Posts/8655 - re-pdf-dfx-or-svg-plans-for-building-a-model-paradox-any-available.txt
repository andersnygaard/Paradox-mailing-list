Sorry if this was too much of a necro post. The initial poster's name is also Matt. But please post your results with your model. I'm hoping someone has these files so I can get a bit of CAD-assisted immediate gratification, versus scaling and lofting off the plans. I saw a YouTube video of an internally ballasted model Paradox sailing, so it seems that it's doable.
