Subject: rudder or not

Hi All,

Just got back from a great day sailing!!!I launched Whisper, motored about a 1/2 mile up the canal raised the sail and took off, she sailed great!! I thought to myself Im really getting the hang of this. After about 45 min. of GREAT sailing I noticed I did not put the rudder down, I left it up and kept going, tacked a few times reached a little........I believe this boat sails better with the rudder up!!!! 

I still need to do some more testing in stronger winds. If that pans out, I will try reducing the rudder size about 50 % or more. I will let you know how it turns out.
