I really like the Idea of a 20 ft Paradox!!

David

Another virtual remodelling of Paradox.
I have uploaded another virtualy modified
Paradox in the Photos folder.

I do not really take this too seriously of course. 

We (friends an I) plan to build a paradox this winter
what we want to do at this point is to hopefully
build a genuine paradox with no modification
what so ever.

Up here in Montreal(Quebec, Canada)(you know, north of Vermont...)
We have plenty of water to fully take advantage of Paradox's
ability to sneak in the most shallow ends.

I do however, love the idea of a 20 footer based on the
same beautyfull design, that could take you all the way to...
where ever... the Pacific... Patagonia... 

I know I'm not allone thinking like this. Mindy and Dave
have a first draft of a 23foot Paradox somewhere on their web site.

Once again I love Paradox as it is. And I can't wait till we build
ourself one. To cruise the ST-Laurent in it and maybe even spend a
winter in the Bahamas in it. Sound just perfect to me.

But maybe after doing all that I will think more seriously about
a full scale (although still small at 20 feet...) Ocean crossing vessel.

Who knows maybe by then Matt will have come up with a new set
of plans for such a boat. Whould'nt that be just perfect... ;-)
