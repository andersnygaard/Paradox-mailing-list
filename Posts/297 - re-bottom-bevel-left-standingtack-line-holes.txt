Subject: Re: Bottom Bevel Left Standing/tack line holes

1.) There are two holes so you can pass the tack line thru and then back to the tack grommet for tightening and making fast.
2.) It's boat builder talk and means that both the bulkhead and the floor timber are beveled. easy way to do it is to leave the bulkhead and floor timber proud enough that you can cut them together after they are glued together. (Proud means that they will stick out more then enough to cut to the finished dimension)

Tailwinds,
