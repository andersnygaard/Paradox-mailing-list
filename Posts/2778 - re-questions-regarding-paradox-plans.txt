Subject: Re: Questions regarding Paradox plans.


I don't actually remember what I did, which suggests it wasn't a big 
problem, but from the scribblings on my plans I think this is how it 
went.

The sides of the vent trunk come from the 9mm sheet with the 
foredeck, one from each of the wedge shaped bits of scrap.

For the 18mm sheet, take the bottom rudder piece and flip it about a 
horizontal axis. Now move it as far as possible to the left so it 
fits into the inside of bulkhead 3. there is room in the scrap above 
for the breast hook, and in the wedge, lower right, for the vent 
trunk front.

One of the reasons I had for doing this was that the rudder 'nose' 
falls off the edge of the sheet. With the new lay-out it is easy to 
put in a small infill piece when the two sides are joined.

If you have a problem with laying out a sheet (and don't have access 
to a convenient CAD system) tape up some newspapers and cut out the 
components. Then you can juggle them around on the sheet till they 
fit.
