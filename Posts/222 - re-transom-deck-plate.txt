Hi David,

I have found the port to be fine. In the event a breaking sea should slam into it, it might leak a little but any water would be contained by the baffle under the tiller and exit out the tiller opening. When in nice weather it is left open with a bug screen over it as a ventilation opening and I can tell you now from experience that a substantial amount of air flows thru the cabin from the vent trunk to the aft port when the hatch is closed. This, of course will be a necessity in inclement weather when you are confined to a sealed cabin.

As long as we are on the subject of ports, I might mention that I increased the size of my water tank ports from 4" to 6" because I found I could not get my arm completely into the 4" ones. I wanted to be able to get to every corner to clean so this was important to me. I have found that when I return from a trip I can fit a hose to the spigot of the galley pump and drop it out the vent opening, a few strokes of the pump and the water will siphon out of the tanks and overboard. A quick wiping out with an absorber removes the last of the water and the tanks remain clean and dry until the next trip.
