First let me reiterate that I don't believe any of this has any relevance to sailing that I shall be doing, so it is all pretty academic from my point of view.

Wouldn't any adjustment be made by adjusting the bridle? I admit 45 deg seems a bit much, but as I said above my opinion is just that and no more.

I would have thought you could have come up with something yourself, as they are hardly earth shattering.

My first idea was a self stowing anchor on the bow with the line running through fairleads (or a pipe) back to the cabin.

Second was a closed fairlead (through which the anchor line passed) attached by a continuous loop to the bow such that it could be pulled forward to anchor off the bow and pulled back to the cabin for anchor recovery.

The one I use is a line permanently attached to the bow, lead back to the cabin. Deploy the anchor from the cabin, attach to the bow line, let out a bit more till hanging from the bow.

As a side issue I have a snap hook on the bow line. I attach the anchor line with a clove hitch. When not used for anchoring it is snapped into a hard point near the stern and provides a line the length of the boat for the safety harness.

It also helps when coming alongside a pontoon as a stern line can easily be attached during the approach and then you step ashore with bow and stern line ready to tie up.

When picking up a mooring buoy I clip on a large (6") snap hook and snag the buoy as I sail by leaving me free to stow the sails before going forward to make a more permanent lashing.
