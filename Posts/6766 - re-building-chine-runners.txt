Subject: Re: Building chine runners

No photo, I am afraid but try this description. When the bottom panel is wrapped into position it is wider than the sides, so sticks out a bit each side. This is then filled with a huge fillet, between the bottom and the side, which is what is visible and is called the chine runner.

The chine curves in both vertical and horizontal planes. I found it almost impossible to hold a full length strake in position to glue it and ended up building it up with battens about a foot long (like building a brick wall) and lots of epoxy.

I can recommend building a simple rough model (balsa for the bulkheads and card for the skins). I built a 3d computer model before I started cutting wood and it cleared up a lot of queries.
