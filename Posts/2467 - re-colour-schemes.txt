Designers use complimentary colors when they wish to attract the eye of 
the viewer. The color scheme in compliment will give the impression of 
energy as the colors have their own sense of vibrancy. You can use any 
of a hundred different colors in the general green scheme to enhance or 
reduce this effect. A trip to a good paint store and the use of their 
chip charts will give you the relationships you wish.

Keep in mind that this type of scheme can also become tiring for those 
on board as it excites the part of the brain that responds to color. If 
the hull colors are kept muted above the gunnels, it should provide for 
a more sooting effect.

Another issue with which to contend is that epoxy, when heated strongly 
by the sun, can become softer if it gets in the neighborhood of 150+ 
degrees F.   Darker colors enhance this effect and should probably not 
be used except closer to the waterline.
