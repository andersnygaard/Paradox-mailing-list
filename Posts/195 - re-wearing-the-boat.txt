Hi Glen,

1.1 works fine for height and width, but not for things that are on angles like the bulkheads, stem, pipe used in roller rigging and cabin supports.

Now you are into either completely lofting it out and taking measurements off the drawings or using trigonometry.

The sail area increase, for example, would be a good deal bigger than 10% if you multiplied all the dimensions by 1.1. Don't you want the area to be 10% bigger or each dimension?

At its current dimensions, the width of the bottom of the hull = the width of a sheet of plywood. Adding 4" more on the width certainly creates more than a 10% increase in plywood cost.

Alas, nothing is for free.
