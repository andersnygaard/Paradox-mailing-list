I wonder if you can generate enough electricity to recharge a battery
pedaling one of these?


Then just use a small trolling motor. No holes in the hulls. You could
install the battery in the stern and have the petal unit wired to it
and easily disconnected to store in the bow area when sleeping. Also
could have a couple of solar panels to assist.

At least you could power your laptop, and also generate some heat at
the same time with the pedaling effort:-)

Maybe add hand cranks as well.
