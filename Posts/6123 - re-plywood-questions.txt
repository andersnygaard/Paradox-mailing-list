The only reason I can think of for going down this route is if you can't get the specified thickness in your area. It strikes me it would require a lot of glue to be sure it was properly joined, with no voids.

I used the cheapest marine grade I could get, and had no problem bending it. The sides you can do with 2 fingers. On the bottom I started nailing at the bow, with the stern propped up, and then worked back. For the final bit I got my son to sit on it while I nailed it. As you work back with the nails it just pulls it down.

As far as strength is concerned, if you think you need it stronger than as-designed then you are not sailing on the same sea as me. It is, by far, the strongest constructed boat I have come across.

On the other hand, with the Chine Logs Matt suggests these may be made from 2 pieces laminated and, unless you can steam the full sized piece, I would recommend going down this route. Gluing that in on your own is hard messy work.

Hoping for calm nights
