You have to sort this out for yourself. 

My solution is to have a socket at the bottom of the mast which can be extracted leaving a 20mm hole. At the top the wire comes out through a hole just big enough for the wire and is then sealed in place with silicone sealer. I hope this keeps out the water, but it won't be tested in anger till next year.

The wire just hangs inside the mast (with padding to stop slapping) so should be easy to replace. I just used 5 amp flex.

I noticed that one of the freqently replaced item on sailboat is electrical wiring due to corrosion. If the lighting wiring and the Mast-head light wiring are epoxy to the interior of the mast. Does it mean one have to cut the Mast open each time to replace these wirings?? (Or is there a Paradox design feature which allow one to do this that I overlook? )
