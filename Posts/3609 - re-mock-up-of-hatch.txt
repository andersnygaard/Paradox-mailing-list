I still think you will find it prevents the furled sail from dropping into the stowed position, but what the hell, prove me wrong. In the end, if you don't like it, there is nothing to stop you making another.

Remember, follow Matt's lead and take no notice of us nay-sayers, then we can say "I told you so" when it all goes wrong.
