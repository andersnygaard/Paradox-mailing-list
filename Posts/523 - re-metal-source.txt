No problem Roger, you get the bar stock and the last of the rod stock. I will only have bar stock now until gone. Send me your address at: ifida@nefcom.net and I will get it out to you.

Hi David,

The source I used for the 1/4" sch 40 brass pipe (it is actually bronze) is Quality Pipe Products,13201 Hancock Dr., Taylor MI 48180, PH# 734-374-5100. I had them send me two 4 ft sections and that left me with enough to redo the lower part of the Tack fitting when I found it was too short when built to plans. I would suggest leaving it about 3" to long and trimming it to fit afterward. Also with the four ft sections you have enough leverage to bend the pipe in a 1/2" conduit bender for the sail and yuloh fittings. as for the forward yuloh fitting you will need to apply heat and bend it around a piece of steel pipe. This stuff is incredibly strong. Their price including cod shipping (they are not set up for visa,or weren't at the time) was $23.65 in Jan 01.

The source for the bronze rod and bar stock used in the lighting switch plate is Atlas Metal sales,1401 Umatilla St, Denver CO, 82204-2432, Ph# 800-662-0143. I had to order a min of 6' of each for a total of $79.86 and will be glad to cut and ship what is needed at my cost plus shipping until it is gone as I don't know what else I will use it for. Anyone out there who wants to avoid having to buy large quantities of this stuff let me know. If there is a enough builders out there it may pay to set up a co-op for this sort of thing. I just measured my stock and found 64" of bar and 54" of round. I don't recall having much waste so you will need 8" of bar and 18" of round. I have enough bar stock for 8 boats and enough round for 3. I will sell the 8" of bar for $4.53 and the 18" of round for $9.77 plus shipping.
