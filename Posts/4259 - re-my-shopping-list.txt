Subject: Re: My shopping list?

The weather's warming up, and I've nearly rebuilt my boat shed, so I've been pricing up materials for my build.
I've found 3 sources of marine ply, all BS1088.
Robbins basic comes to =A3548, marineply.com "Far eastern" =A3252 and Okume at =A3472. (2x18,4x12,3x9,1x6mm)
At half the price the Far Eastern sounds attractive.
Has any one experience of the product? What would be the disadvantages of using it (weight, strength, workability)knowing that Matt only spec'd AC Exterior for the vessel.

I used the Far Eastern. The 6mm had rather thin outer plys, but otherwise it was fine (so far :-o)

Can any one guesstimate how much epoxy resin I would require to build and sheath the boat? (litres, gallons, bushels or West C packs).

Start with a 25 litre drum, and then buy more when that runs out. By that time you should have a good idea how much more you will need.

Hoping for calm nights
