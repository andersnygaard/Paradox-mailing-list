Subject: [paradoxbuilders] Ironsides Floats

I launched Ironsides today and all went well. The ballast may not have been enough ( only 395 lbs total ) but for the wind I had it was good. The trailer behaved well too. My skill at useing the roller reefing and topping lift will come with time. I had a couple minutes of using the yuloh. I'll need more time for that too. The boat did everything a good sailboat should do. The tacks went all the way around nicly. I was most struck by the freedom of not holding on to a tiller continuously. I could go for good long periods without touching the helm. Freedom! The friction of the tiller rope was loose too. I'm surprised it steered this way. I'm curious to see how she does in stronger winds too. There was also a nice gurgling sound from the choppy water against the hull. After about an hour of sailing, dark clouds rolled in and the wind seemed to fall to nothing. Retrieving the boat on to the trailer was not bad. I must make a better system of rigging out the boat fenders. Some small eyes and hooks maybe. I'll put up some photos in the gallery under Ironsides. Today Ironsides was successful and I'm happy.
