Hi Dave,

Actually, the paradox is a Sharpie design and sharpies started out as fishing boats in coastal waters of the Eastern USA. The bottom design is very good for shallows and they are beachable.

I sailed my 26ft sharpie (not a Paradox) all around the southern US coast and island hopped in the Caribbean. I am not sure whether the enclosed cockpit will hinder your fishing, but the boat should be fine for it.
