Many homebuilt aircraft, including ones I have worked on, have been made with 
steel fuselages (chrome/moly 4130).  

Yes, I am familiar with chrome/moly 4130 and others as well, but I can't see those 
types of alloys being practical or reasonable for small boats. 

I thought you were talking about the regular, run of the mill steel sheeting and tubing 
like a plant nearby turns out.

My next door neighbour is a welder and is going to build me a cradle for my boat from 
the nominal 1" square tubing. That is what I thought you were referring to.
