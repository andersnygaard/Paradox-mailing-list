I recall that Al Law had this happen. I don't know how to advise you. Do you think you could drill a cross hole for a small pin/rivet?
Good luck

On Sunday I noticed that my lower rudder pintle has some play, several degrees in any direction.  I took everything off.  The rudder head has been sitting in a warm, dry room fro three days now, and there is still some moisture around the pintle.  I think that means water has seeped into the plywood and is slowly coming out now.
How do I fix this?  And does anyone have any idea why it happened in the first place?  It is not at all a problem I expected.
I'll take a picture as soon as I have recharged the batteries for my camera.
