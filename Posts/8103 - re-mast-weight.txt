Hi guys,

Thanks for responding. I am thinking of building a Paradox but the mast weight is critical to me. I have had both shoulders operated on and a heavy mast could injure them again. I was thinking of using a tabernackle instead of a removeable mast. B&B yachts has an interesting arrangement on there Princess sharpie series that could work. The Paradox mast does not seem to heavy whether made of wood or aluminum. If a tabernackle was used, it would have to be built in and a perminant, structural component that would be keel mounted and not merely deck mounted. I sailed an Alacrity 19 for the last 15 years that had a deck mounted tabernackle and when raising and lowering the mast, it was a pleasure to use. I think that if a Paradox had one, it would be very easy to raise and lower the mast when transiting bribdges, etc. More thinking is needed about to build it in the boat. 

Thanks for the quick answers,
