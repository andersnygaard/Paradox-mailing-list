Subject: Raucous Sail today on Scout video links...

This was a great sail...steady 22-25 with gusts topping 30. Scout handled it awesome. Any doubters about chine runners...I'm here to tell you...she went to windward just fine...even clawing off that lee shore you see in the background. I am more amazed every time I push this little boat. Here are some short vids from today's sail

If you are building a Paradox...KEEP GOING ...it's gonna be worth it.   I'm going to load a few pics of getting hit with a 2-3 foot breaking swell. Scout shrugged it off , kept me warm and dry, and we pushed on no worries. :-) Love it!!!!
