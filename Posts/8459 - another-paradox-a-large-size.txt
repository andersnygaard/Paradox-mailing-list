Subject: Another Paradox, a large size
Date: 26 Aug 2015 11:04:24 -0700

Hi,

There seems to be a tradition that every Paradox boat has a "going 3D photo" posted here. And it looks like every Paradox has a name by the time. So I have "locked" her name and posted my 3D photo in Thu's album.

She's being built in Estonia, is a 20% larger version; the opposite way to recently posted, reduced in size, PO :)

When I assembled bulkheads to sides, I checked and fixed the diagonals for every section separately. I believe these can each be unstraight differently.

Regards,
Eerik
