Hi Kjell.

The photos of Paradox show the prototype mainsheet arrangement, in which the sheet was fastened to the boom, and then lead through the transom. The improved mainsheet arrangement is shown in the plans.

I'll probably fit some wooden chocks under the horns of my cleats, connected with bungie cord so they don't disappear overboard. I think that a dome shaped piece of material could be fitted on top of the yuloh point to help prevent fouling, as would a bungie from the rudderhead to the deck. 

Here's a small pic of some cleat chocks. It should not be difficult to improve upon the design.
