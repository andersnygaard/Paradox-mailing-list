Thanks for your response, Jeff

The footwell sounds like a great idea!  I hate sitting with my legs straight out.  In my Jewelbox Jr, which has a "Birdwatcher" type cabin, I recently added a low bench across the aft end of the cabin--only about 4 inches high.  That was all I had to work with, and I didn't have much hope it would do anything, but I find it makes a big difference.  It makes it possible for me to get my feet under me a little to change position (which I have to do when I tack, since JB Jr is unballasted).  

Ideas, experiences anyone?
