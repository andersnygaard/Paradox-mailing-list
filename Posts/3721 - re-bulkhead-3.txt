Hi,

You said the word :)

Being that the "steel" could be properly prepared with today's practices you trade strength for area, I don't see any reason why it wouldn't work. your best bet would be to sandblast and epoxy. make sure the sand you blast with is not "beach" sand. even abrading with a hand grinder would do it. I cannot remember off-hand the ratio of strength to wood, 5 to 1 or more. Steel is a well-beaten material here. lol
