I'm afraid I won't be able to make it this year Dave, Nancy now requires constant attention and my daughter has two little ones of her own to take care of so leaving her mother with her for more than a day or so really puts a strain on her. Who knows I might be able to get down for a day anyway. I was just getting ready to email you to see if you were going. Have fun!!!!!!!!
