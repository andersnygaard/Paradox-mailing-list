Drat!

I wish I'd created the Group.io group a few days ago. I didn't think it would be $220 (AU$320) to set this up. They will only do a Yahoo Groups migration into a Premium account.

I have created a group called paradoxsailboat. It is presently a free account until we figure out what to do.

How shall we proceed?
