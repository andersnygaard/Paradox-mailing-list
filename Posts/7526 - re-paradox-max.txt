Subject: Re: Paradox Max

Hi,

Paradox Max number 1 is under construction. After careful consideration, it is finally time to build a larger paradox by 20%. Now there is some sour burp but what the heck.

The first plan is completed, plywood comes Monday to Wednesday, epoxy should also exist. Timber comes in June. Timber for masts also comes in June. 

Okoume plywood in Austria in these masses (3100x1530) that I wanted very difficult to get, or only in large quantities. But then got plates 2item 3100mm x1530mm x 18mm for the bottom.

I have studied all contributions, as well as all images here. I noticed some differences in your seen boats and transferred what was important for me in my boat.

Odyssey is a very successful boat, but even Johanna, Faith, Cachivache, Ironsides, Paradox in Taiwan, ParaPlastic, Zoe, NZ Paradox, as well as other boats have also been very helpful.

Bye,

Günther
