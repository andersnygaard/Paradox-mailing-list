I built the tanks as designed and used them for the first couple of years. However I had problems with getting the inspection hatches watertight. It was also a pain emptying the tanks at the end of each trip.

After a couple of years I fitted 70kg of lead inside the tanks and used it like that. However now the boat was heavy on the trailer and I felt it wasn't doing it any good.

I eventually found some reliably watertight inspection hatches and fitted a submersible bilge pump into each tank. Now all I have to do is switch on the pumps to empty the tanks through the deck fittings. I am happy now with the way they are working.

I don't drink the water from the tanks, in fact I often fill them with with sea water. If you want drinking water be careful what you paint the inside of the tanks with.
