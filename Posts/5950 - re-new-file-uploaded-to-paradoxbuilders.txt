Hello,

This email message is a notification to let you know that a file has been uploaded to the Files area of the paradoxbuilders group.

File: /Paradox vent box analysis.pdf 
Uploaded by: light369369 <light369@gmail.com> 
Description: Interest analysis of Paradox air flow with different position of hatch 

You can access this file at the URL:

This is good, but it doesn't seem to take into account the vent in the transom. I know for a fact that the air flow in my cabin does not follow the pattern shown with the hatch closed.

Hoping for calm nights
