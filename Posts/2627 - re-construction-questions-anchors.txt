As soon as I hit send, it occurred to me that it was probably a typo. I guess Paradox is such an iconoclastic boat that I don't take anything for granted. If chine runners can work so well, maybe a lot of my assumptions about other stuff are wrong, too.

I'll probably never build a Paradox, but just reading about the design has done me a world of good. It shows, more clearly than any essay, how questioning conventional wisdom can lead to remarkable advances.
