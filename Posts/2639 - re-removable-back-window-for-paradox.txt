Subject: Re: Removable back window for Paradox

Sorry about this Dave and Al. Is there a simple explanation as to why some mail seems not to be getting through?

I was thinking that the window could hinge from the bottom down and outward onto the rear deck. As Bill says, the sealing would easily be taken care of. I was also thinking of making the lexan pane smaller and the wood frame larger. possibly even all wood with two small fixed ports in the side supports.

Special thanks to dave for putting the pictures up to help us.

Cheers  .......  Derek
