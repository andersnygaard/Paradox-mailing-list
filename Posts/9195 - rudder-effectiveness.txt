Hi,

Recently I sailed in a wooden boat regatta, as part of the local annual wooden boat show. I thought I would be the slowest of all the boats entered, I was certainly the smallest. I kept up easily and even overtook two others, it was a surprise to me.

My question is this: 

My tiller is always active, there is hardly a moment when, especially at speed, that the tiller is still, it's very tiring. Always pulling it one way or the other, sometimes by large amounts. Rather than use the rope steering as per Matt's design, I've extended the tiller into the cabin with a crude pole. It's still not a final solution but it works. My hands were getting very sore on the ropes, as I never seem to be able to just set and forget the rudder steering.

Is the boat's balance incorrect? Am I too heavy aft?

Has anyone noticed steering problems with a Paradox, "out of balance"?

Hope someone has a cure.

Nick
