To help alleviate the masses-of-rope problem I use the same rope for 
the halyard and the furling line. One end attached to the yard, the 
other to the furling drum. 12m of rope will leave about 2m (a doubled 
rope 1m long) inside the cabin. A 2:1 purchase on the halyard would 
mean more while sailing, but still less than when using 2 ropes.
