Hi All,

I would like to hear more about Glens modifications to the Reefing system. Im having trouble getting mine to work. What did you use to run your reefing line through? The plans call for a round thimble. Im getting a lot of friction in that area.

I have decided to use a good marine paint, and restore her like she should be. The bottom only has one layer of glass.( I think?) not sure what to do there? 

You Guys are going to love this Boat. My 3 yr old and I have a ball sailing her. This is the only boat I have that I will Take My son sailing on by my self.She Feels that safe.

David
