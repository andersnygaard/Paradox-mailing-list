Subject: Port Townsend Wooden Boat Show

Hello all Paradox (or microcruiser) lovers of any type! 

I wanted to let my West Coast friends know that I'll be taking my Paradox "Scout" to the wooden boat show in Port Townsend Washington this weekend. If you are a lurker and have wanted to see a dox up close and personal, this is your chance (if you live close by). Further, there will be 299 other boats likely far more interesting than the Paradox there too. Lastly, the weather should be nice, which for the Puget Sound area is a treat all it's own.
