Here she is afloat:

I've just had 3 days in Poole Harbour with Al Law and Little Jim. I hit one mudbank, 3 pleasure palaces (2 off them in one strike) fended off a fourth with my yuloh and narrowly missed the broken marker post that threatened to tear a hole in my sail.

The first night, moored in the R. Frome, I couldn't sleep because I thought that every lap of water was coming in the boat.
Second day was largely motoring -strong winds - but I sailed for half hour or so backwards and forwards and had a fairly successful go at yulohing for a few yards. The outboard is a double problem by catching the mainsheet and being difficult to control. I have to turn and lean over the rear deck to reach the throttle and then the steering wanders. My double strike was because the tiller caught in the foam and jammed and everything happened very quickly.
The biggest fright was going back up the Frome and meeting a multi hull coming down that looked bigger than a house.

I'm thinking to move the motor to the starboard side and extend the tiller so that it comes over the center of the rear deck. I'll try a different route with the mainsheet.
I need to make a new boom, mine has a bend and doesn't roll smoothly enough, and then it is back to Poole with lighter winds I hope.

I learnt a lot in a short time, all with Al's patient help, and was absolutely cream crackered. I'm looking forward to sorting the teething problems and doing a journey.
