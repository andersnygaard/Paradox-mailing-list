Subject: Re: Johanna maiden sail

Just a quick note to say I have completed my shakedown cruise. I've learned a lot and there are things that need changing/fixing. Overall things went very well although I did have my moments! There as a sharp learning curve to overcome,,,

I'll write up a full report once I get settled again!
