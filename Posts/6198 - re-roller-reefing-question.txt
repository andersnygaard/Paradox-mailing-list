I totally agree with your sentence.... "With someone like Matt, if the design feature looks a bit complicated there is probably a very good reason." Except, I would remove "probably".  The English are so wonderfully "reserved".

Ahh, if you are too dogmatic someone will come back with the one instance when it was not true :-) (I'm a Scot)

Why would " you removed the tack strop entirely" except to remove the rig from the boat?  I assume you are saying releasing the entire assembly from the deck? by accident?

I am not suggesting you actually do it, it was just a thought experiment to demonstrate that without the support from the strut the reefed rig would be unusable. In Matt's original design, and my (independent) simplification the joint collapses sideways in compression and does not give that support.
