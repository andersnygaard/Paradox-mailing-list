I would be interested in what kind of filter is good when painting and glassing?? Chemical filters would be a must for me and one of the reasons I don't build is concern for my health.  Just regular house paint makes me sick. Any experience??

I have always used one of the better 3M Valved Particulate Respirators, West Marine #2671147, 3M#8611
