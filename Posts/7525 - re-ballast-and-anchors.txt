Subject: Re: Ballast and anchors

On my latest trip to the Bahamas in ENIGMA I took only one anchor because of space, and it was a 8.5 pound Mantus, which I think is one of the best pieces of ground tackle I've used so far. I plan to get another one for LITTLE CRUISER since it comes apart and it is easier to carry then the HUGE 25 pound Luke Storm Anchor I've used in the past. At $90 the Mantus isn't cheap, but it works in a wider variety of bottom types then anything I tried so far. On the other hand, if you don't have the money, then a standard 9 pound Danforth will do the trick just fine. However, remember the only real insurance that you have that your boat won't go on the rocks/beach is a good anchor so getting something inferior is really a false economy. In anchors, I believe bigger is better because the heavier anchors tend to penetrate the bottom more easily, especially if there is grass down there.
