Subject: Re: grounding plate for lighting protection

Rod, in a nut shell, get a piece of copper flashing and drill small holes every 6 inches or so around the perimeter and then countersink the outside side. Now rough up the other side with course sand paper. Coat it with thickened epoxy and put it in place. Before hand put down mastic about three or four inches out all around and have some bubble wrap handy to put over the copper then a layer of heavy plastic drop cloth which will be held down by the mastic. Cut a hole in the plastic anywhere convenient and attach a shop vac sealed with mastic to the hole. Now when ready, turn on the vacuum and leave until cured. The bubble wrap will allow the air to be completely drawn out of your make shift vacuum bag and the cured epoxy in the countr sunk holes will give extra security in holding down the plate.
Hope this helps
