Jim, I sent that document to Westaway and asked to build to the specifications. I also sent some pictures of the sail as rigged on Zoe. They were unsure about my specification of eyelet position so I sent them a sketch. That and the yard offsets is all i did, they created the sail from those details.

Yes much better on port tack, however some of that was because the sheeting angle (that I have) encourages over sheeting whilst on stbd tack. Now that I realise this, I release the sheet when tacking when before I wouldn't have bothered.

I might lash something together and see if it works.

I may be along at Cobnor in a couple of weeks if you are there.
