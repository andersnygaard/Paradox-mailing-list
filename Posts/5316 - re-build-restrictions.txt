I have been thru this in the state of Washington. I believe it is identicle in all states because of Coast Guard laws. Keep all your recipts for materials as this is proof you built it and it's not a stolen boat. I went to the state licencing desk in my county. The place where you pay for licencing tabs. You should say on the forms, when asked, that you built it for your own use. (Not to sell). They will ask how much it is worth in your estmate. The state will give you a hull ID number which you permanantly afix to the right rear transom area. If you boat is stolen these will help the police to return it to you! That is about all I know. Let us know how it goes. Steve Yahn
