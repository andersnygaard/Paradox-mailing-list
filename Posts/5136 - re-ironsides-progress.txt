I thought I would do all the fiberglassing before I do the cabin. 
That way there is no delicat structure bearing the weight. I intend 
to use some old tires under the boat, as a cushion, when I roll it 
over. I've done this on another boat and it works nicly. Today I did 
more painting. I tackeled and finished a job I have been dreding. I 
melted the lead into the rudder blade. It was easy. See Pictures. 
Good Luck, Steve Yahn
