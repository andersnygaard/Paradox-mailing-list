Subject: Re: Water Tanks: First Time Use

Hi Nick,

The test you performed for water tanks: Bottled water against just using the tanks results 70 litres in the tank and 44 litres in 2 litre bottles. The weight difference is app 154 lbs to app 97 lbs. Almost a third of total lbs is lost using the water bottles.

Appreciate the testing and observations you made on the tanks.

I'll be performing a test on the starboard tank this afternoon. I have the tanks dry and the boat. I'll fill water 25 percent increments. i.e., below the filler tube, then above the tube.

I will report my findings on here thereafter.

Fairwinds,
Deric
