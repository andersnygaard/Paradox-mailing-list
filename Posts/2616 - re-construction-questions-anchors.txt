Matt Layden carries an 11 lb Bruce and about a 15 lb fisherman on his Paradox. On Little Cruiser we originally carried an 11 lb Bruce; however now we have a 9 lb Danforth and a 4 lb Fortress, which we find are easier to stow underneath our floorboards. These anchors work fine where there is good holding ground like in the sand or in the mud. However, where there is lots of thick eel grass or where the bottom is very hard, we usually deploy our 25 lb take-apart Luke Storm Anchor. Obviously, the 25 lb anchor is total overkill for such a tiny boat; but I have to admit that it's good to have the ultimate storm anchor and the peace of mind that accompanies using such a weighty object when an especially nasty storm is headed your way. Moreover, we find that carring the bigger anchor is not much of a problem since it is stored in the bilge where it serves as ballast anyway. 

I guess if I were outfitting my own Paradox now, I would probably just get a Danforth style anchor along with some sort of plow anchor for trickier bottoms. Then, I would attach about 10 to 14 feet of 3/16" - 1/4" galvanized chain along with 100 feet of 3/8" dacron line to each one, and I would be good to go.
