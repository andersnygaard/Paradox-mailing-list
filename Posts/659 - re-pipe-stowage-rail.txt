Subject: Re: Pipe Stowage rail


I *was* intending to fill the pipes with something inert (polystyrene beads?) then pour in resin and stick a bit of 8mm or 10mm studding in the ends. When it has gone off I will have something like a huge U bolt. Drill a couple of holes in the deck, add washers, stick through deck, another washer and a nut.

What do you see as the main drawbacks of this idea?

Hi All,
   Does anybody have any thoughts on how to install the P&amp;S pipe stowage rails. My plan was to mount a backing plate under the deck and drill a 1/2 inch hole, fit the rail and fill with epoxy. Any thoughts or comments?

David
