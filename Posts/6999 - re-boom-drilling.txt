Well, I take no responsibility if you emulate me, but I just clamped the boom horizontally in the vice and drilled it freehand. I did drill it oversize and then, standing the boom on end, epoxied in a length of 15mm copper pipe (to give a good bearing surface on the stainless bar I used. I put a cap on the pipe for the end of the rod to bear against). This allows a small amount of correction to be made if necessary during the gluing process. 

At the other end of the boom, to take the bolt for the sheet/topping lift tang, I drilled oversized, filled with epoxy, then drilled and tapped the epoxy. Make the tang much stronger than you think necessary, several builders have had that bend during use preventing the rig being reefed.
