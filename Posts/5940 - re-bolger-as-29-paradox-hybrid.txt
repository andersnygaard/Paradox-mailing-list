Would love to hear more about this design. Hogfish Minimus?

I would also like to know if Chris has ever mentioned the best hull shape for chine runners? My feeling is a sharpie with a rectangular cross-section amidships, and considerable rocker - like Jessie Cooper for example.

St. Valery's bilges are rounded off so would not work I would suggest.
