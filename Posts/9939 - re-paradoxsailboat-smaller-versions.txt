There's some pictures that n the log of Matt's portage set up on Enigma during the ultimate challenge. Needless to say, it almost ended in disaster, and probably lost him the race with all the wasted time. You've still got to take your hat off to anyone who portages a boat 40 miles!
There used to be some videos of this portage on the watertribe site too, but they sadly are no longer there.

Hi everyone!

We're looking at building a couple of smaller (3m) boats and I was wondering if anyone had information on enigma or elusion they could share? I can probably work it out from the paradox plans and pictures I've found online, but I know some folks have build little ones before so it seemed worth asking. Even just a table of offsets or something would be super useful.

We're also planning to use portage wheels. I thought I had read that Matt had a good system for portage wheels that were easily stowable. Do any of you have info on that?

Thanks so much, and I hope you all have a beautiful day!
Molly.
