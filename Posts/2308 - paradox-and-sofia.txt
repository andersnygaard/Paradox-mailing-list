Paul,

Thanks for the Photo Comparison between the Paradox and the Sofia. I am in the process of building a Paradox of my Own but I am also very interested in Sailboats in general. I really like the "Elver" Canoe Yawl by Steve Redmond. I have half the deck in My Paradox Strip Planked so far. Lots of extra work but,it is a Labor Of love---

Take Care
Dave Blow
