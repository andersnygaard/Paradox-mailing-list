My boat has a round hollow timber mast (bird nest construction) which is already pretty light and not a lot of windage. I have however thought of going lighter again with spun tapered aluminium - a lot cheaper than carbon. Not high on the to do list but as I approach 70 any weight saving getting the mast up will prolong use my use of the boat.

Hi Erik and Deric...I'm always interested in lighter spars, too. One possible source is looking at carbon windsurfer masts. I used an old fiberglass mast on a little trimaran a few years ago as a test, and I didn't break it, although I didn't sail it in any really heavy winds. It was an encouraging -- and cheap -- experiment because I got the mast for free. Another path might be to contact the folks at Forte Carbon  https://fortecarbon.com/  and see what they've got. Maybe there's some extra masts or booms sitting in the back room that they'd like to find a new home for. I've read about Hall Spars, too, as a good source for carbon spars. Supposedly the little Scout dinghy kit at Duckworks can be procured with a two-part carbon mast, so somebody out there must be producing them. But if you actually find something, make sure you're sitting down before you ask the price!

Cheers,
