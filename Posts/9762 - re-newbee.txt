Hi Andre,

If you still thinking of selling one of your boats I am interested. I think if I can get a boat already built then I can be back on the water this spring, then take my time building another.

Around Manitoulin Island would be a dream, but having just started a new job, it looks like my sailing is going back to weekends only. I would like to try some ocean sailing, but that is going to have to wait also.
Have you done any sailing on the St. Lawrence?

Covid sucks. We need to be able to meet people again.
