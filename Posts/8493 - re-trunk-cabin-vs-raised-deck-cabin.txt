Most of the space under the side deck is shelving and storage bins, so moving the windows out would not really increase interior space.

I have never been in any danger of hitting my head on the sides, I am usually lounging in the corner of the seat. As the sitting position is near the centre of rotation there doesn't seem to be a great  deal of relative motion.

If there were 2 on board they would be unlikely to be sitting side-by-side so the windows would be no closer than with only one.
