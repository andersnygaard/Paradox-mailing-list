There is one tool that I find makes my life much more enjoyable for shaping complex boat parts: A Nicholson pattern makers rasp will give a much smoother surface than an ordinary version or the Surfform rasp mentioned. They are available at Lee Valley and the price is more than double what you paid. They will soon pay for themselves in many ways including making paddles and oars:-)

If the link doesn't work, just go to leevalley.com and do a search under that name.
