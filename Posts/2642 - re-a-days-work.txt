Thanks Dave

Things seem a little rosier with the new day.
 
I'm going to try a different method. I have a spare set of dinghy trailer wheels and an axle. 
I'll mount that to a baulk and strap it under the point of balance of Enuf.
I was surprised how easily she slid along on timber and concrete.

The picture of the trailer is excellent. Thanks very much. I now know what I am looking for 
and I've seen similar to this on eBay. 
If you and Mindy are ever visiting the UK you'll be very welcome in Wolverhampton whose 
only saving grace is its proximity to Shropshire and Wales.

All the best .... Derek
ps The wife is nearly talking to me again. She made me a cup of cocoa last night and 
smiled. It may have been a snarl, but there was nothing in the drink 'cos I've woken up this 
morning :0)
