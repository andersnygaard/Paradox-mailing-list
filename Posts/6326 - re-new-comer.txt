Hi All,
My name is Gil Kolan, and I live in Israel.
I have built a PDR and sailed it on the mediterranean  and the lake of Galilee. 
The Paradox sailboat came up in one of the threads and immediately caught my eye. So I bought the plans, easy and straight forward. Yet when I tried to complete the order of paper work with the Paradox build manual I was not so successful.
Can anyone tell me how I can buy acopy of this manual?
Thanks
