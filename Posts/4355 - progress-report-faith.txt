Subject: Progress report 'Faith'

The cabin trunk roof of 'Faith' is now in place and I've fixed the 
runners for the hatch, along with the transverse pieces.  My next task 
will be building the hatch - any tips?

Photos will be posted to my web site http://www.paradox-uk.co.uk when I next update it at the end of the month.

Bill.
