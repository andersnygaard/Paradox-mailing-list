Hi Steve,

Without a doubt building the little boat gave me great satisfaction and if the first two days of sailing her are typical, I'll have a great deal of fun in store.

Bill,

By visiting this page http://www.smallsailboats.co.uk/paradox/build5.htm you can see two photos of my Paradox sailboat at Burnham Marina. She is now out of the water awaiting her West Country cruise to start towards the end of June.
