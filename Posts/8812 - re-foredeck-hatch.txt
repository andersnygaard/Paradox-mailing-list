Subject: Re: Foredeck Hatch?

Yes, Jack. We'd like more information. That sounds like an almost 30% scale up -- the largest that I have heard of thus far. Some information on length, beam, intended displacement, draft, and sail area would be appreciated. I would guess that you're looking at a 3000 pound displacement.
