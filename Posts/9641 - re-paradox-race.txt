Hi William,

I would like to add my voice to others in thanking you for you kind offer.

A couple of points:

1. I would love to participate, but the ice here in Canada is 3 feet thick right now. Maybe you could hold the race in warmer months?

2. A race in different parts of the world on the same day does not seem to be a good idea to me, since the winner will be decided by favorable weather rather than by sailing skills. Perhaps a solution would be to permit varying the race day within a one month period so that we could all choose a favorable windy day of our choice.

3. I also think that a fair race has to be done on a there-and-back course so that upwind sailing skills are included. Without this requirement, downwind only sailing for 12 hours needs more than 120 km of waterway. With an upwind leg, a 50 km long lake is likely to be sufficient. We are not all located near such large expanses of water.

Just food for thought, of course it's your birthday, you can do as you wish. But I for one like to have a year long birthday!

Again, thanks for such a great idea.
