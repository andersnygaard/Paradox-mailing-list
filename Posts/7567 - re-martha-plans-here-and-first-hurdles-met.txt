I've always gone plus size thickness with plywood when boat building. Sure the designer probably has extra strength tolerance built into the design but I don't know how much to I'd rather be conservative. According to CLC site the difference between 4mm and 3mm sheet is only 2lbs. How many sheets does a paradox require?

Here is my first problem and it is abot matereal thiknes. it seams taht all the standard thiknes of ply in sweden is often 1mm thicker then US standard. I have encontered this problem before wen building kayaks. The solution then was to just go with the thicker ply. A 4mm thick ply kayak is not to bad compared with a 3mm one. I do not know however if the extra thiknes,and therefore weight, will be to much. I think this will be a non problem in the end and i will probably just go with the thicker ones. I would however apriciate some input. Ither to confirm our discorage.If not my options are ither special order ply,wich is a financial nightmare. Our just planing down 1mm of the boards. I have actually done that with a swall model kayak. Buth that is just a horribble horrible nightmare.
