I've avoided this topic so far because I feel you have to go out there and find out what works for you. Having sailed the Paradox design now I have found that if you are in an area where disposal overboard is not a good idea, you are probably in an area where you can get to shore (you can wade) and use on shore facilities or dig a hole and dispose of it that way. After all if your in a shallow anchorage or dried out up a tidal creek you sure don't want to have "that" to look at. 

We own a 1967 VW camper and it became necessary to have a porta potty because of the places we find ourselves camping. We were able to get from K-Mart a very small one (Passport Potty 8L) measuring 11 1/2" tall by 14 " deep and 12" wide. I have never come across one any smaller. It works great, does not smell and is easy to empty and clean. It would fit in the forward compartment of the Paradox if I felt I needed it for a particular trip. 

Think about how much time you sit on a toilet a day and then consider what you are willing to give up and how much inconvenience you are willing to endure to have the pleasure of one on a micro cruiser. If you are not a camper, you might want to consider something larger. Believe me when I say you need to be a camper to enjoy a micro cruiser. I have never seen a toilet in a canoe or a sea kayak and they have been out there camping and cruising a long time.
