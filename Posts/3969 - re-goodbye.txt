Thanks David ... my email is on Bill's website

Derek,

You cant leave.........were all pals here.....But if you must please stay in touch.

God Bless

David Beard

Thanks to everybody for their help during the build. I'd like to particularly single out Al Law,
Dave Bolduc, David Beard and Don Elliot.

If my op works (booked in for next March) I may build again. but a lighter, quicker and dirtier
build perhaps incorporating some of Jeff Uk's changes and definitely making proper Honda
provision :0)

Cheers all ..... Derek
