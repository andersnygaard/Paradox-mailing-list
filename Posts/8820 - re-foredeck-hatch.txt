Jack,

I'm also interested in your construction technique. I am considering doing it that way because I have a bad back, and by using a strongback, I can conceivably break the larger segments such as the sides and particularly the bottom up into smaller pieces for handling. Indeed, it's not out of the question that I can set up the strongback so that I can rotate the hull to keep the work surface horizontal and at a convenient height.
