Subject: Re: Anyone building a paradox

Hi John,
I'm in the beginning stages of building a paradox. No mods as I am a new boat builder and will build to plan. Stephen is living in probably one, if not the best place to take advantage of the unique design characters of a paradox. The Sound is really beautiful place to boat in, and I have been powerboating there and rafting many times but the only downfall can be the maddening light drizzle that can fall most of the year and is somewhat unpredictable. There is really 2 or 3 good sunny months and sometimes only 1. I loved it .. the people go out and the place is beautiful but boating in an open cockpit sux!! "Ironsides" is gonna draw Stephen alot of envious looks I predict!
