Thanks for everyone’s input. 

So the plywood de lamination issue in making the beams had me reading through every post about deck beams today. I picked up some great tips from the read through, especially building the jig from the BOTTOM of the beam…now I have to modify my jig but at least I didn’t make 7 unusable beams!!!

I think how I am going to approach this is by making the laminated plywood for beams on Bulkheads 1,2,5,6 since they have bulkhead support in the event of de-lamination and use solid Mahogany strips (laminated) for 3,4 as they are unsupported and solid wood should be stronger or at least not separate like ply “could” - the solid beams are coming out to 48mm but I can either sand the 3mm off or set them 3mm lower on the cutout bulkheads I’m thinking.

I also saw someone laid out the bulkhead patterns and cut those into 6mm ply and glued/screwed a 3/4” hardwood to it. This option seems way easier but know nothing about that techniques strength?

Also researching 8x6mm vs 5x9mm for laminations strength, any ideas on that are welcome!
