Hi All,

Will an ordinary dust mask work ? Or will I need something else ? I want to be well protected sanding that stuff.

Thanks 

David

Hi David,

The only way I know of is to sand it off, a job I hate to no end.

Hi All,

Im going to add a few more layers of glass to Whispers sides and 
I need to remove her bottom paint that was put on last year. Any 
suggestions on how to remove it SAFELY.

Thanks

David
