Groups.io is capable of transferring all the data but they may be incapable at this time because of the rush from all the groups that have already signed up. One of my aircraft groups is grandfathered in for the first year for 10gb at $10.00 per month. Now it=E2=80=99s double that almost.
Everyone may need to save their own posts and repost them to the new website!
Groups.io does have the capability to transfer everything though as long as they can get to it before yehhoo erases it all.
