Looks very cozy Al. I noticed in the picture of the water tank you mentioned that your tanks leaked a little. Mine did also until I made a handle about 8" long and glued some short pieces of 1/2" dowel rod in it at the appropriate distance apart. I can now snug it down tight enough to keep it from leaking and also open them very easily.
