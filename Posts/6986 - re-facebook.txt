Today Facebook is the social network and greater penetration in the world, and as a professional media think it's a great way to bring more people aware of the boat design and its benefits. Integration with other email services allows real-time be informed of all movements made on your site, also has own mail. On facebook you can upload pictures, videos, notes, comments and any information it deems appropriate, which added to its binding to the cell phone makes the best means to communicate in real time today. I recommend that you investigate the site services and be amazed of the benefits. 

There's an old adage that says, "which proves not harm," and if we limit ourselves only to the yahoo group, few would have access to know the paradox. Nadia discusses the work he does in the group, on the contrary, thanks to him I could build my boat, which has its own site as well as many other builders, if we get carried away by his ideas should close them all and to all forums where there is information on the paradox. 

No my friend, no mistake, this is not to compete with anyone, nor pretends to be better or worse, only intended as a place where it is reflected over the excellent work of the designer. 

Best regards
