Hi,

I quite agree, that paradox is the micro crusier par excellence, the minature HR, or Has Christian anderson of the micro world, but for many of us crossing the north sea in a force nine, is not our cup of tea, however we value the benifits of interior sailing position, simplcity of design, self righting etc to be the essential elements of the paradox philosphy.

Yours,
James
