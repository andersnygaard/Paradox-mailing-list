Do the horizontal cuts only. When you come to join the sides to the bulkheads you line up the corners of the bulkheads with the top and bottom edges of the side panel. No measuring required, You can see immediately it is in the correct position.

I would recommend that you laminate the chine log. I didn't and it was by far the most difficult bit of the assembly so far. Physically hard and potentially dangerous as you are winding up a lot of energy as you bend it. 

You are supposed to do a dry run, then remove it add glue and re-assemble. I could see that there was no way I could do the re-assembly before the glue cured, and I wasn't sure I could safely disassemble it after the dry assembly, so I opened up the joint in position and shovelled in some glue. It appears to be ok, but I am sure there are lots of voids in there.

I read this in the plans but was too lazy to write it correctly.

Question: the sheer clamp notches should get the horizontal cut only, not the complete notch. Can the chine log notches be cut completely? Or should only the horizontal cut be made?

Finally started with some woodworking. I am building my deck beam mold and intend to laminate my deck beams out of 1/4" plywood.
