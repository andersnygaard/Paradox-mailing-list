What about getting hold of some old car batteries for the lead.

In the Uk we have to pay (lots) to be able to get rid of them from our garage workshop and if a Paradox builder asked for some we would be happy to present him with a load.

Might be a bit hazardous to break up and some common sense precautions would be in order. 

I can tell you that the acid from them makes an excellent weed killer....;-)
