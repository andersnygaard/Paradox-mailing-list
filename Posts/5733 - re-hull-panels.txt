Subject: Re: Hull Panels

There are many methods described in the boatbuilding literature and on the net. I think anyone building a Paradox would be well advised to read the Gougeons' book on epoxy boat building - "Gougeon Brothers on Boat Construction" - there is a detailed description of scarfing there and in my opinion it is the most comprehensive book on epoxy plywood boatbuilding out there. With that said, scarfing seems more intimidating than it really is. I agree with Al in that the ply veneers thems give a good indication of flatness and straightness. My advice to Robert or anyone with the same issue is to just dive in and don't be afraid to make a few mistakes along the way - it's the only way to learn, and if you're worried about ruining some expensive oukoume ply, practice on some cheap fir Home Depot junk.

On the same subject - has anyone come up with a simple jig or other method to ensure the scarf planing process is accurate for a good fit of the panels, or is it simply a matter of using skill and a good eye?
