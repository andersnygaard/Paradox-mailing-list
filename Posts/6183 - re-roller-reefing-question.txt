Subject: Re: Roller reefing question

Hi Kellan,

Yes, even Matt's plans evolved a bit on the roller reefing design. On the original plans, the bottom tube rope connects to the next piece of the structure. In May of 1996, he revised the plan to show it  connected using the split 'Y' type fittings.

I saw a picture of the roller reefing system used on a Texas200 boat and it looked very similar. Don't know if I have a picture of it.

Enigma looks to a certain extent like a miniature Paradox and she embodies some of her characteristics such as the chine runners, flat bottom with rocker and box sides, but she is a different boat in that she is a light displacement vessel by comparison with Paradox which is a heavy displacement boat.

George van Sickle is building a 15 foot version of the Enigma with a 'hard top' cabin. You can see his progress on his blog: http://e460.blogspot.com/
He also has a short video of him sailing his Enigma.

I have some pictures of the original Enigma on my webpage:
