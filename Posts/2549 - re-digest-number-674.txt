Go for it - I am 60 and have already got the ply and epoxy plus a good 1:5 model built so the project is underway  and, what is more, this part of the world needs many more PARADOX's ;-))

One comment I would add to those already well made by Dave Bolduc is that a big plus for the boat in these latitudes where high UV is a problem for those of us of this age and outdoors, is the sun protection that the enclosed sailing position affords.
