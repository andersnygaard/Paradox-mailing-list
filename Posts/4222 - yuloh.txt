Subject: Yuloh

I made my yuloh from a solid piece of spruce, but I failed to incorporate a 30mm longitudinal concave curve into it.  I'm about to modify the yuloh, but drawing 3 shows at least a 50mm concave curve when measured from the centre of the yuloh at right angles to a straight line between the tip of the blade and the end of the shaft.  Which is preferable?

One of the confusing instructions about the yuloh drawing on sheet 12, is the word `forward', represented by For'd because to my knowledge there is no forward part of yuloh, unless this is a designer nomenclature.

Quite clearly, the lower side, or under side of the blade has a greater cord (curvature) than the upper side.  I've searched many places on the Internet, but nowhere can I find a clear picture or diagram showing this characteristic.  I've also searched the archives of this group.

When the yuloh is in use I assume the flatter side of the blade is uppermost, and yet from the poor photos on the Internet, the opposite would appear to be the case.

This has left me confused.

Am I correct in assuming the centre of the pivot socket is 1350 mm from the top of the shaft and 1650 mm from the tip of the blade?

Bill.
