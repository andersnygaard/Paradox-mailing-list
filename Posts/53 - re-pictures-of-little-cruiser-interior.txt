Dave,

Send me enough photos (like the one you just posted), and a few rough sketches and dimensions and I will do a complete cutaway drawing of the interior of Little Cruiser, no charge, it will be yours for your book, that, I think is a pretty good deal. Also, I would show some other detail views to clarify things. This will help the members visualize Little Cruiser a lot better. I would probably have to send it back and forth to you to get it right.

My understanding is that there were no plans or drawing made for this boat, is this correct. 

Don,

P.S. please use my personal e-mail address to get the details.
