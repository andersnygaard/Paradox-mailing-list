Hi Rob, 

Your points make sense and I could not figure out how to put a race together that would work for everyone because there are too many variables. I was hoping that someone would figure it out. As far as the money goes I set a little aside every check and on my birthday I do something impractical with it that makes me smile. Seeing paradox’s race would make me smile. And I was hoping that the larger amount of money would encourage someone to figure out racing but it sounds like it is impossible.

Rob what do you think about the most adventurous paradox in 2021 wins. If it was for this last year you would have won.
