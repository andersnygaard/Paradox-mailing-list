Al, why was the yuloh so far aft? 
New trim trick?  I love the fact that you sail Little Jim sans motor. 

The yuloh position was laziness mostly. I had been using the yuloh a 
few minutes before and expected to use it again as I came ashore in 
the sheltered water so had just left it mounted on it's pivot. If I 
had been travelling further I would have stowed it properly.

I was very interested to see the film myself. I had not realised the 
boat was pitching so much, it certainly didn't feel like it from on 
board. Thanks Pete.
