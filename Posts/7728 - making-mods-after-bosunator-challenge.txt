Making the Most of Lessons Learned During the 50 Mile Bosunator Challenge.

I was able to evaluate many aspects of the boat and myself during the 20 hours underway. Things that during a 2 hour long day-sail would never come to light, became very, very apparent. Chafing mainsheet lines, comfort, nigh-time lighting, paddling gear, and ventilation were just a few of the mental notes I made of things to address when I got home. Now the modifications are underway before the next test sail. I've got them on the Blog at www.fullnby.com.
