Subject: Re: Sitting in Paradox

Either a beanbag or a foot well should solve your problem. However, I would ask if it is a problem that you have experienced or one that you anticipate? Even with our British weather I find I spend little time shut below.

I would rate it more important to be able to change your sitting position occasionally. To this end I have 5 cushions of different construction which I change round every hour or so.

Also, when sitting below, don't stow the seat flat against bulkhead 4 as shown in the plans. By cutting a notch in the seat support battens it is possible to make the seat board into a sloping backrest which is much more comfortable.
