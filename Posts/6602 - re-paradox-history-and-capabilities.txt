Hi Rod,

Let me suggest that there has never been - to my knowledge - any controversy over the design from any person who has actually built one, seen
one, or sailed one. But a lot depends on where you plan to sail, how good a sailor you are and if you decide you want to go solo most of the time.

I think it actually fits into a fairly narrow "niche" in that regard and is why I was more drawn towards a Bolger Micro instead.  It can easily take 4  (or more)people day sailing and since I am not a sailor first, I like the engine located on the center line to fire up at a moments notice. I also prefer a cat-yawl rig.

I would still love to build a Paradox just the same:-)
