G'day John

What a great place to have a Paradox, Tassie! Maybe you can cruise down to the Dewent one day. I lived in Hobart for awhile and that was a great waterway but Launceston is a top spot too. Thanks for enlightening me about the metric plywood sizes. I knew there was a problem re Australian metric sizes but was unsure what it was. Do you have a workaround for the glitch ("...problem with our plywood with bulkhead No3 at 1214mm wide...") besides using imported ply? Even though it's a beautiful timber, Gaboon is Okoume (Aucoumea klaineana) aka Samara. As you probably know it is a West African hardwood that may have been harvested from old growth forests or rainforests overseas. I would prefer to use a local ply using a sustainable timber species if possible.

All the best
Shane
