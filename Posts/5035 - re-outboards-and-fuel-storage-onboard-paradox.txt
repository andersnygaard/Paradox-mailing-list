Just to put things in perspective in our power hungry society.

Back in 1979 a guy called Gerry Speiss crossed 3800 miles of Atlantic in a 10 ft sail boat he designed himself  in a tad over 54 days!

For power, all he had was an outboard and fuel, a gambolled portable gas stove and gas cans, and a sack full of batteries to power his radio's and tape recorder.
