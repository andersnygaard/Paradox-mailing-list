Hi Jeff,

Thanks for the photos.  The lines of NOLI look sweet; she should be 
quite a slipery Paradox type with a good turn of speed.  The extra 
length and light construction should enable her to leave Paradox 
behind in most conditions.

I'm looking forward to meeting you and NOLI if possible this summer.

Bill.
