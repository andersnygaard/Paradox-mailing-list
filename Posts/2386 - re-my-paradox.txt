Hi Derek,

Looking great! You should be able to pull the two ends together using a "Spanish windlass" I think it is called. I have never used one actually and can't find a description offhand. Maybe someone else will help.

Basically you attach a loop of fairly heavy rope around the ouside of both sides - something like a large noose. Then you pass a round dowel or pipe under the loop and start twisting it which will close the loop gradually and pull the sides towards each other.

You may have to install two temporary uprights just ahead of the loop to prevent it from slipping forward as the sides close up and I am not sure exactly where to install the windlass - perhaps 1/3 the distance back from the stem?

You will also probably have to install two temporary scabs to the bow ends so that clamps can be applied and the scabs will support them. Once you get the ends closed up at the bow you can then install a inner stem shaped to fit. Then you can remove the clamps and shape the stem profile and install an outer stem-piece. Not sure how that fits in with the original plan though. If you have a one-piece stem that will fit - all the better. You might be able to support the stem area with a temporary set of braces so you can remove the clamps. Or in your case - cramps;-)

This will require a helper unless you can lock the windlass in place by yourself. It just needs some twine siezed around the dowel and too the rope loop.

The seat you refer is called a "moaning chair" and is the first I know of that has wheels. It should have a beverage holder or two on it and perhaps a seat-belt if things get really bad:-)

Good luck, Nels
