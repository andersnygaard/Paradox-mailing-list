Hi Jim.

If you lower the cabin sole by just 25mm and use camping bedding foam mats in place of the insulation as drawn, this might do by giving you an extra few inches.

By trimming and leaving just over 100mm under the sole on frame 3, 2ltr bottles of water will be able to be stored there giving a plenty for over a week or two.

Sheet steel on the bottom. No. Too much hassle. There will still be more than enough room for ballast.

Leave out the lower side bins and cut frame 3 locally back to 85mm. This will give you extra sprawling room. And take the cabin sole right out to the hull sides.

PARADOX as designed is for long distance cruising, being away for a month or more without back up.

For the type of "dinghy" cruising we have in this country, UK, we are always somewhere near civilisation.

And a Tesco.

So we don't need such large storage.
