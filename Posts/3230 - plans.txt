Hey All,

I've been kicking the idea around the idea of building a Paradox for a couple of years now and finally sent off for the plans. Dave got them to me lickedy-split. I've been going over them and they are clear enough. Materials accumulation will begin this weekend and building may begin as soon as Boxing Day.

Everyone thinks I'm nuts. I live in the desert.
