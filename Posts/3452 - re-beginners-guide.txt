Subject: RE BEGINNERS GUIDE

Hi all, 

Just read through Derek's guide and it makes a refreshing change to have a new builder giving his take on building Paradox. There are words of wisdom garnered from actually going through the build, warts and all. It is a great pity that this has not been done before. I do hope that Derek will complete the manual, especially his take on getting Paradox in the water. Hopefully the group will add their own pearls of wisdom. 

Martin
