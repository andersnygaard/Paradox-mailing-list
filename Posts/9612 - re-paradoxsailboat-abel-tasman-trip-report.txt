The best starting point is to read what Matt himself says. They can't be treated in isolation.

Small craft advisor interview is here towards the bottom of the page...

Hi Graeme,    The comments from me and Chris are in support of chine runners on Paradox.   There have been other boats that used the chine runner concept with success.   The designer Matt Layden also developed this design over a period of time on several different boats also with great success.  My understanding is that Chine runners are designed to deal with the unique environment of the Bahamas where shallow draft sailing is required.  If you are in an area where a shallow draft sailboat is not required then there are other designs that might be better suited.
