John made a very good point earlier and my comment was not quite fair. Lots of folk start a new project before the old one is complete and just like having a variety of things on the go. I've done that myself at times too.

And thanks for being so honest and frank Brian.

Best,
Jim.

Thanks Jim and John,

I do tend to start new projects before the last ones are finished. I guess I like starting things better than finishing them. I'm not planning on rushing right into building the Paradox boat and I am still working on my self-designed one sheet boat currently. If anyone cares to see what I've been up to with this boat, here's a link to my build thread over at the wooden boat forum.

Yes, I know I'm not building it out of the best materials or the best methods but I'm having fun and learning a lot in the process and that's what I was after with that project. I'm building my second test sail right now and hope to test it out on the water pretty soon. It won't be the best sail boat around and might not even work but I won't know for sure until I try it myself. I'm a lifelong student at the school of hard knocks.

Hi Brian,

Thanks for the interesting reply. I don't want to sound discouraging, but can only suggest that you get one of the boats that you've already built sailing before starting a new project. Until you've tried it, you won't even know if you'll like sailing, so perhaps best not to spend any more of your resources on more boat building until then.

Good luck to you anyway, whatever course you steer in future..

Best,
Jim

Thanks for the tips and the new picture Jim,

I'm still waiting for the printed plans to get here. I guess someone in the post office wanted them first. Dave Bolduc did E-mail me the PDF version and I printed them out on
