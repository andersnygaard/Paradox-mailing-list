Not sure Ray but could be, I'm thinking that mostly it was in the hands of some one who really knows how to sail these little sharpies and the fact the the boat is very light. I'm not sure what it's sail area to displacement is but I would bet it is better then Paradox's. I was hoping to actually get to sail with matt just to compare performance but we were always on opposite sides of the out laying islands and going in the opposite directions.
