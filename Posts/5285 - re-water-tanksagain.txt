Subject: Re: Water tanks..again..

Thanks Al,

I was hoping to make one of these tanks for drinkable water and was actually gonna split the design using one half per plan and the other with a plastic tank insert. I was thinking with the water inlet valve I could control it so no rainwater would enter drinking tank. Add a valve to water outlet and I could control which tank to use. Desalinater for fresh water refill on long voyages or filter water from rain side to go into fresh tank.... all this sure sounds like alot of work after I just spelled it out for you. Prob best to stick with plans and carry drinking water jug with a portable watermaker onboard for long hauls. Hehe.... sometime I think I luv gadjets too much.
