Copperpoxy would be the best. As a less expensive and labor intensive alternative, VC Offshore would prevent marine growth and provide a nice slippery teflon finish as well. That's what I used on my SeaPearl 28 b/c it is trailerable and doesn't stay in the water all the time. Renewall of the finish is much simpler and quite a bit cheaper. I'd probably use an Interlux 2001/2002 epoxy interprotect as a base.

They make a color of copper not shown in this add that looks nice on mine. With your white boat the black would look nice (or even blue).
