WOW Paul! That looks fantastic! That's the kind of work, similar to modeling, which makes the eventual construction of the boat more straight forward. I imagine that just looking at your images will help others. Would you mind the inclusion of your work within the build manual (which I need to work on...)?

What kind of software were you using?
