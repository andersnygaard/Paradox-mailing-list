Hi Is the 65ft sail the right size or would it be possible to trim about a foot off the boom considering the strong winds we seem to get more and more these days, one could also have a light spinnaker for those barmy summer days. Where are you hoping to sail this summer? Maybe we ought to plan a paradox meet, Poole harbour? I am in Bradford, Yorkshire where are are you? But parents live near Poole. Will be cutting my ply today for my enigma type build. Thinking of using 3/4ply for my winglets approx 6" wide and 3ft long, as Matt suggests the higher aspect ratio helps. I will have to find the website that gives the scientific data behind chine runners. Also will have soft top ala enigma, but with timber rails etc. May convert to birdwatcher style later on. Yours James
