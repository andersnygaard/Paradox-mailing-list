Hello All,

While I was building my paradox I was skeptical to say the least about the likely performance of the design. Since my paradox was completed, I've ventured into some pretty wild conditions and every time have found Small Fry to perform very well. Having had quite a bit of experience by now, I am beginnning to appreciate the degree of experience which Matt has incorporated into his design. Years later I am still discovering every detail of the paradox, no matter how simple it may appear, has had plenty of thought given to it. For what it may be worth, my advice to those who are not sure, you should trust Matt as a designer, he knows what he's doing, and his suggestions about the paradox's designed performance do work out in real life conditions. Not only has Matt designed a sea worthy boat, but he has carefully thought through the building process and consequently the building process is not difficult. There is more detail and instruction included in his plans than some other well known designers who's plans I've been able to examine. If you stick closely to his design and resist the temptation to deviate the result will be good.

Cheers,
Geoff (Small Fry, Australia).
