Subject: Re: How heavy without ballast?

Hi,

I am building Enuf and when she was just a hull my son (20) and two of his friends were able to lift her quite easily. I think they were helped a lot by my clear and detailed instructions from nearby :0)

I am now near to putting the decks on (having loads of trouble bending the front deck sufficiently; any advice anyone?) and I can slide her around on wooden blocks by myself with some of my ballast in place. I think that 5 or 6 fit folk may well be able to lift her a foot or so into the air as she is now. I hope so, 'cos my trailer should be here on Saturday.

I'm not sure that any part of the build was particularly time consuming, although I have spread it out since August and had several breaks, but scarf joints in panels are very irritating to make; I've used a lapped butt joint for the floor. Chine logs are a pain (I cheated and made mine narrower) and don't leave the vent box until the bulkheads are in place. I did and it was a big mistake :0(

If the kit had been available when I started I would have used it. Having the panels ready shaped isn't going to detract from the pleasure of the build. Did I really write pleasure? Alec Jordan built me a hull for a Paul Fisher Coble (which I still haven't finished because I became obsessed with Paradox) and I was very happy with the quality of the work. There were time delays because Alec suffered some ill health, but they weren't important to me and I would happily recommend him as an honest fellow.

HTH .... Derek
