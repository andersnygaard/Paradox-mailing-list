Actually Al, while at the start of the Everglades challenge Matt was pulling "Paradox" out of the water on a high energy beach and during the process many large waves slammed into the stern sending quite a bit of water into the cabin. I got to watch as Matt pumped the bilge dry and as I recall it took a good many strokes before he finished up with a sponge. After seeing that, I decided I would like a bigger pump then the one I carried and also I think it would be a good idea to have a rubber disc mounted on the tiller about an inch away from the transom and large enough in diameter that it would seal against the transom if hit by a following sea and keep most of the water out or at least in the baffle compartment. It would still allow for flow thru ventilation but keep the seas at bay. I have never taken any water aboard "Zoe" that couldn't be taken care of with a sponge but I have had seas come aboard from the stern on other boats. One such was entering Ft Pierce inlet against the tide and strong wind opposing,everything was under control until a large sport fisherman barreled past and his wake swept over the transom and into the cockpit. Fortunately in that case I had put the wash boards in before entering and the seas were contained to the cockpit but it was still scary.
