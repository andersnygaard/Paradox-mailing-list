Hi Glen,

Sounds great! Actually I was in the process of getting info on the area for a cruise around April or anytime it will be warm enough.This 35 deg sailing I have been doing is for the birds, Plus I need some ocean experience. I'm open to locations as well. I'm free just about anytime with a couple weeks notice.
