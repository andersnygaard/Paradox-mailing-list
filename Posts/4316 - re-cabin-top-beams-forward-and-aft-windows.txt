Hi Glen.
Thanks for the input. They seem to make a nice sail.
Have you found with your new sail that extra little bit of shape has made a difference?
I had thought about buying from the States but I think I will stick with my usual sail maker, CAWS SAILS in Cowes here on the island.
Graham, a one man show as well, has made me several sets of sails in the past, sprit, lug and Bermudan, and he always comes up with the goods, and they always set beautifully. He also will try the sails on the boat and make alterations only if he is satisfied.
Ah well, back outside to do a spot more gluing. The temp is up to about 68 now.
