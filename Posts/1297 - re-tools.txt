Hello Al, the lists sound all too familiar, isn't this my list of tools from my "Building Paradox" booklet? The acid brushes, the straw, the epoxy palette, spray bottle for vinegar, and so on, all of it in fact. If you had been following the thread then you would know that this is so.

There is a major change to that list, the lead pigs were changed from the bread pan shape to, if I recall, square, long forms, these were molded in plywood boxes (See booklet). Maybe 3 x 3 x 12 long, that's a guess, I would have to check on the exact size, but they were melted down and re-poured to a shape like that, (perfectly square and long), see the upcoming ballast articles for that shape. Don

I prefer the wedge shape that the bread pan produces. Mine are 12kg each and can easily be lifted with one hand due to this shape. (Paint with Hammerite while still warm and in a couple of minutes your worries about handling lead are over)

Hoping for calm nights
