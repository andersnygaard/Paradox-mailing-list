CHANGE BRAND-METER MADE IN CHINA BY HAMMER OF 20 KGS.

The man will get up early, prepare a "Mate" (drink typical of Argentina) and said: "To this day he can glue around the Cachivache." Put your hands on the play, had a brilliant idea, check the steps of the bulkheads that were carefully taken with a brand-meter Made In China.

OHHHHHHHH surprise, did not agree anything.

Verified the instrument with various elements of measurement, including the subway seamstress, with DREAD was able to verify that these sons of the subway Asia has 99, what they were singing cms.

To sum up: the fool had to redo all the bulkheads.
