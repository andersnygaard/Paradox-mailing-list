Sorry if my comment on the depth sounder came over in the wrong tone, 
I was not having a go at anyone.

I was just question whether a boat of this size really requires so 
many electronic gizmo's?. It is a value judgement. I have enough 
problems talking to outboard motors!!.

All the best for your future sailing.
