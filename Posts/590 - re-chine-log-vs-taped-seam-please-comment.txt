Subject: Re: Chine log vs Taped seam (please comment)

Well, I'm certainly no expert, but I am half way through building a Paradox.

About the gap in the joint, I hope it works with a gap in the chine log joint or else I am in trouble :-)

I am not sure that a taped joint would work on Paradox, or more precisely I think it could be made to work but would not be worth the effort. The method/order of construction seems to have been very well thought out: 

First the bulkheads are constructed, on the flat, with all the fiddly bits. 

Next the side panels and bulkheads are joined. This is easy for one man to do, and once it is done the 'boat' is sturdy and can be rolled over and worked on with ease. It is during this stage that the straightness of the boat is set, again very easily.

Next there are some details and then the bottom goes on. This is 18mm thick and must take quite a curve. Again this is easy for one man, starting at one end with glue and nails working to the other. The bottom is only roughly shape at this stage and is trimmed after assembly (a feature that recurs through the construction)

Later the deck goes on with (I presume as I haven't got that far) the same ease.

If taped seams were used a number of questions arise. Off the top of my head a few are:

Are all the joints (bulkheads included) going to be taped?

How do you pull down the bottom with just the ties to hold it?

How do you work out the correct shape for the bottom panel?

how do you hold the structure straight while the joints are made?

These problems could no doubt be overcome but why bother when the system as presented is so easy?

I have to say that when I considered building a boat I rather assumed it would be taped seam construction as the only other boat I have built was made this way. It, however, was a light 8ft dinghy whereas Paradox is a heavy displacement craft. (I have spent some of the last week sorting the fitting of the ballast and shifting 180kg - that's 400lb - of lead in and out of the boat a couple of times has convinced me of that). 

With the construction as drawn the only thing I have had any assistance with was turning the hull over after fitting and glassing the bottom. That was because I am building in a narrow garage and the hull had to be rolled onto its side onto the childens' roller skates so that it could be pulled across to allow it to roll the rest of the way. (Does that make sense?)

Have you got a copy of the articles that Don Elliott wrote? These are a must if you are serious about building a Paradox. contact Don at delliott@tomah.com or on the Smallboats Yahoogroup where he is the owner.

So I have no hesitation in saying go with the plans from an ease of construction point of view. From a strength point of view I can only say that my hull is already extremely sturdy. I suspect that taped seems would make a less rugged craft.
