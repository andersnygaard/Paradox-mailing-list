Subject: Re: Do you want to swap boats?

The only way I can see a Burmudan rig working is to have an incredibly long boom behind the boat. I haven't done the calculations, but the sprit works with the mast, sprit boom and yard all measuring 4m. Any longer and you're going to have to carry them outside the boat. I'm not sure the extra hassle is worth it as that was one of the features my Whiting 16 marveled at... all the rig is stored inside the boat and it's so fast to assemble.
