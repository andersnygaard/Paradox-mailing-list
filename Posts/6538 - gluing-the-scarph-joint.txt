Subject: Gluing the scarph joint

Hi there,

I glued my bottom scarph in place on the boat. First, I glued the bow pannel (short), which came on very easy. The aft pannel and the scarph itself were a bit more work but it turned out very good.
I clamped the bottom pannels to the sides and bulkheads using bunch of pipe clamps and 2x4s (across the boat) to spread the load. 

I will recommend this. It's easier to deal with smaller pannels.
