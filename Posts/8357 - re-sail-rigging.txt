Hello,

I hate to report on my every activity but I am looking for feedback on my observations. I tied the tack strop extender close to the mast as one person suggested and this greatly improved things. I noticed when the leach end of the sail swings to starboard the tack strop is more vertical and the rolling mechanism works much better. When the boom swings more aft the tack strop swings forward and rolling the sail onto the boom is very difficult also the Luff rolls tighter than the leach. The sail itself rolls onto the boom more evenly when the boom is swung more starboard. Is this a function of the Yard connecting point? also, would a topping lift improve this?

Thank you.
