I'm working my way through Don Elliots build manual. He mentions in there that he thinks a table saw is more or less essential. I read somewhere else that someone said a bandsaw was more useful. Do I need either, neither or both IYO?

Also I keep seeing reference to a Skilsaw. Is this what I would call a handheld circular?

Sorry for all the silly questions....
