Subject: Re: depth finder

A simple depth sounder can be purchased for less than $100. I believe that a simple fishfinder can be had for only a few dollars more. A handheld GPS can be had for a similar price. I personally think that these prices represent an incredibly good value, financially, and as peace of mind.

As I have had occasion to both utilize a great many electrical nav equipment, as well as lose them, I must say that few losses have given me concern more than the loss of the lowly depth sounder, that even as I felt quite confident that I would not run aground. Around the Pacific NW, it is often said that a depth sounder is the most useful navigational tool for proceeding up or down the coast. Just hang onto whichever fathom line suits your liking. This also gives an LOP for use with your regular dead reckoning. Around here, using the "touch and go" method of depth sounding can lead to loss of the boat, and demise of the sailor. 

It might help you to think of a depth sounder as a means of 'assessing distances from obstacles'.
