Hi Nick,

Your trip report nearly slipped past me with your title of Ballast, but I was very happy to read your maiden voyage was a great success. I'm always amazed at the speeds people report for such a short boat. I'm convinced the chine runners contribute to that.

Looking forward to more reports, particularly your promise of a heavy weather report. If it's the south coast of Australia you're sailing then it won't be long before we have your report!

Cheers,

Rob.
