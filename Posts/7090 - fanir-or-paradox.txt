Hi,

I am wanting to build another small sail boat capable of coastal short trips. Have just finished my first boat, a Bolger Micro, but want something a bit more solid and with less cockpit and more cabin. Must be self-righting, etc, etc. I am ready to begin a Welsford Fafnir but just wondering how a paradox would compare. I love the fafnir but a little concerned that the weight/sail ratio would make it very very slow.

Best regards,

Rod
