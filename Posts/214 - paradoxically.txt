Its a new year....

okay, got that out of my system..

Spent all day Xmas on Paradox, and have cut out all panels, ready to attach timber cleats to the bulkheads and scarf the side panels.

But: out of money, out of time. Gotta go away for three weeks on exercise so all i can do is a bit of workshop maintenance, and a little cleaning up of my cutting work. 

Everyone have a good start to the new year, its bl$%dy hot down here - 37-39 degrees celsius - just the time to go into the 'boonies' or bush as we call it!!!

I'll catch up with the group late Jan, early Feb.
