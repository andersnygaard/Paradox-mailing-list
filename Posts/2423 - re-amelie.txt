I asked on another group if anyone had any constuction pics of BW. Someone sent me a bunch of pictures of various BW's with an interesting one which looked like a plywood hull, with an aluminum deck structure. It looked like the sides were raised, and the top lower in comparison to a normal BW. He forwarded me an email address of the builder that started with aeneasprecht. I just found this address again, as I emailed him in 2000 and never received a reply. There is a Aeneas Precht in the phone book up there, I called yesterday and got an answering machine. 

Is this the same boat, and if so, did you guys see this in a boat magazine somewhere? I never asked the person who forwarded the pictures how he found out about it. Was wondering if there was more info somewhere. Although I was at a library flipping through a fiberglass boat building book, and seem to remember a picture of that boat in a sidebar, but no other info given.

I was trying to find out what he did to come up with the modified lines of the boat. 

Thanks,
Paul
