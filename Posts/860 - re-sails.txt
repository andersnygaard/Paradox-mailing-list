Hi Al,

I have made a very crude sketch of the rollers and it is attached. The rollers are 6 inch long 2 diameter boat rollers mounted on trestles made from 2 X stock mounted on 2X4s. Matt carried both rollers in the bilge compartment on the starboard side, which is to say they were made to stow in that area. They worked great (He had two sets) and would move one from the stern as the weight went on to the forward one. I think the overall length was about 30 inches and the width about 12  14 inches.

He also had a line attached to each one long enough that he could tie it to a cleat so that it would not drift off in the surf until he could retrieve it.

Tailwinds
