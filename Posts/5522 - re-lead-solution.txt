Subject: Re: lead solution?

Gold would be better than lead, but your Idea has merit, If lead is too 
expensive, or hard to obtain, other materials will work fine, this is 
what you loose, space.. It just takes more of it to do the same job, 
space on the paradox is prime real estate, if your not planning on long 
term voyages and do not need to optimize every square inch, well its 
worth the trade off... one trip I just filled heavy plastic bags I had 
brought with me in case I needed ballast, beached it and filled them 
with sand. trimmed her out and got her down on her lines, the Paradox 
MUST be down on the lines to do what she does correctly.
