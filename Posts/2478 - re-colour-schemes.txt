Blech! Just MHO.

Perhaps a pale gold? The thing is - if you go with a lighter color,

Who has time for painting over? Wasting good sailing time.

Take my advice Derek and do what I did, open your garage door and see

Oh, and don't try to use pvc floor tape for the trim lines, it 
doesn't stay stuck. I shall be all green next season.
