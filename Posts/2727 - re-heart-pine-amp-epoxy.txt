I dont mind sacrificeing a few saw blades to get the spar's I want, if the epoxy will hold.

Thanks

Hi All,

I am slowly but surely fininshing my second Paradox and starting the construction of the mast. I have some Heart Pine 2x4 and 2x6 that I tore out of a remodling job on my house that was built in the 1920's. This stuff is hard as a rock. I thought about using it for the mast and spars, but am not sure how well the epoxy will work with the seasoned wood. Driving a nail in this wood is almost impossible. Any thoughts?
