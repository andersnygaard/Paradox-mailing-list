Subject: Re: Alternative auxiliary power...

Alan,
This is great post, and funny.
It is also very logical.  I can't verify the numbers but a person needs
the exercise and that is as simple a device as possible to generate
significant power.  
Does anyone know of an off-the-shelf device like that?

Hi,
If you grab almost any can of food, say baked-beans, you will read
that there are let's say 2000kj of energy in there, or about 500 food 
calories. If you then do a conversion or two, you can workout that's 
about the same as 500watt-hours. 
If Al's outboard uses 15amps @ 12volts =180watts, it will go about 2.7 
hours on the amount of energy in the baked-bean can, and doing 2knots.
The average human can probably do about the same speed in a boat this
size, by rowing, sculling, or using a yuloh.
Since it is known that Mr Average can comfortably produce 100watts 
output power, he should be able to keep going for at least the same 
time on the same can of food, and in theory about 5 hours!
'Food for thought' eh?
The human body is actually quite efficient, and you have to have it 
with you anyway...
Cheers,
Alan.

BTW Chocolate has more than 5 times the calories of baked-beans, so if
your 'fuel-tank' space is small, take chocolate!
