Subject: new poll - How many group members have built a Paradox?

I think it would be interesting to know how many of you have built the Paradox already, so I started a new poll "How many group members have built a Paradox?" 

I joined this group about a year ago, and bought the plans in March'09. I can't help being obsessed about this design, and I have built two models so far, using just paper, scissors, and scotch tape. (I printed the plywood layouts from plan #6, and cut them out, then taped them together). I've read many of the prior messages and obtained Don Elliot's booklet, both the PDF from his widow, and the hard copy from MAIB. Even though I think I'll build a 16' outrigger sailing canoe first, I plan on making the Paradox after that.
