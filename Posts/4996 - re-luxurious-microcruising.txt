I had a "Little Cod" wood burning stove in a 21 foot cruising sailboat. It took me a little while to learn how to use it. The problem was it was too hot. What worked finally was to keep the fire really small inside the fire box, and feed the fire one small stick at a time......every 5 to10 minutes or so. This was not as bothersome as it may seem as I was sitting in a small hammock chair immediately opposite the stove so I merely had to lean forward.
I spent about 5 weeks in November / December in Vancouver living in pretty reasonable comfort while doing some upgrading courses. Those familiar with Vancouver would vouch for those months being the worst as it is cold and WET.
I'd guess the Paradox would be fine with a couple of candles and some sort of heat diffuser

In the chilly UK during this April a little charcoal burning stove would be very welcome. 

Thirty years ago I built a YM Goosander 23 footer and fitted a small cast iron stove which burnt those oval compressed coal thingies. I lived aboard all one winter at Poole and the cabin was always toasty inside.
That stove was too big for a Paradox - about a foot high and nine inches wide with a length of scaffold pole for a flue.

I'm sure there is room in a Paradox for a tiny home built heater. Could perhaps be made from 3 or 4 inch diameter copper or stainless tubing with a 1 inch, or so, diameter flue pipe.

But you'd have to be careful not to get a spark onto you're inflatable mattress...; -)
