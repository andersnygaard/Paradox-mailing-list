I too have thought about enlargment by 25%. However When I drew it up 
it was just too big and heavy. So I redesigned the central frame. The 
hull sides give a wide enough space but the frame sides edge in too 
much. So by eliminating the side bins and using steel bar for the 
frame side they can be, say 1 1/2, inch wide. I'll post a picture when 
I get to that point.
