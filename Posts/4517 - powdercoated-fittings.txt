I have added three new photos of my latest work. The two rudder gudgeons are machined out of aluminum. I bought some thick plate at Boeing surplus. The arched deck keepers are made of steel. The flat disks are cut from 1/4 inch plate and the 1 inch dia tubing is electric conduit 90 degree bends. These I brazed together. To stop corrosion I am trying something new, powder coating. This new to me I mean. Al Law gave me the suggestion to change the arched deck keepers to a lower, stronger, and less rope snagging shape. These are 4 inches high. Cant wait to see how they do.
