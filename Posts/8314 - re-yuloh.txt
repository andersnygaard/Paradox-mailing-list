Very helpful. I am currently setting up a Guppy 13 for rowing (in order to ditch the outboard). The yuloh tips may have just taught me how to keep the oars in the locks. Thanks!!!

Can't wait until I finish my Paradox; so that, I can use Alastair's yuloh tips as well.

I appreciate this group very much!!
