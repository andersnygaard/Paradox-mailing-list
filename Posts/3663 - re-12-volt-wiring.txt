I like to use the smallest wire possible because, to me, exposed wiring is unsightly. When I built my paradox I was able to install conduit but when it came time to wire my brothers and my Peep Hens the wire had to be left on the ceiling under tape. I finally found some clear duct tape that almost disappears when painted to match the ceiling.

Your quite correct in my opinion. Some people like to make a nice match of the load to the wire. I tend to go for the easy overkill. But thats just me. I wish I could get the hang of using IMHO. I always admire it when I see others use it.
