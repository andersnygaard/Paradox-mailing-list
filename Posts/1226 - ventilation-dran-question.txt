Subject: Ventilation dran question
Date: Thu, 23 Oct 2003 23:37:54 -0000

Reading the following in "Little Jim's" web site (one of the best boat construction sites I've ever seen!!)I have a question.

 "Further investigation showed it to be water running in the deck vent into the vent trunk, and then out through the drain."

Where is the drain for the vent trunk? 

Any enlightenment would be appreciated.
