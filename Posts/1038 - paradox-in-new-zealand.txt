I've posted some pictures in the Files sections under "NZ Paradox" of a Paradox that is nearing completion in New Zealand.  I scanned these pictures for the 67 year old boat builder who took these shots several months ago.  Working mostly part time on the weekends, he is now close to being done.  The deck, bottom, cabin and interior are finished, as are the rudder, spars, sail and running gear. Everything was built according to the plans with the exception of the spars, which are round and were constructed using "the birdmouth method." Hopefully, there will be some new pictures when the boat is ready to launch.
