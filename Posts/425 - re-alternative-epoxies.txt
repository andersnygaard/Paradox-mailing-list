Subject: Re: Alternative Epoxies

As a note of interest, there are only two companies that I know of that manufacture epoxy. They are Dupont and Ciba Gigy. The companies that sell the epoxies sell one or the other. There are many, many different formulations. WEST holds a patent on the hardener they had developed.
