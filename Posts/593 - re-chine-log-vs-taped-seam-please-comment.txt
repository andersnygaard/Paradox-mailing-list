Subject: Re: Chine log vs Taped seam (please comment)

Many thanks Alastair for the information.
Exacly the kind of ideas that I was looking for. 
I guess I just have to trust the plans... and hope for the best.

Just cant wait to get started now...

Most sharpies with there perpendicular sides are built with chine logs rather than stitch and glue.  Multichine boats with lower angles do better with fill and tape.  For one thing the joints are more accurate when nailed.  At 90 deg they loose there self aligning characteristics.  If you must tape you would have to radius the shine first and then fill the areas on either side with thichened epoxy.  Then you tape over and fair.  This would add a lot of weight which is not be necessary.  The outside is generally radiased and the cloth goes on the outside.  I built a Micro this way.  Trust me, You could have driven a tank over it.
