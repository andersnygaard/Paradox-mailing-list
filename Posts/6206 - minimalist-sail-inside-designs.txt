Subject: Minimalist sail-inside designs

I've changed the topic, since this thread no longer has anything to do with ordering the build manual.

I don't think it would be at all difficult to turn Sand Flea into a sail-inside, at least not if you are relatively short.  All it needs is a minimal canvas cover over the top of the cockpit opening, much like the one on the Enigma 360.

As to cubes, any number of roughly cubical boats have been *proposed* over the years, but I'm not sure if any of them have been sailed successfully!

-- Bolger Superbrick
-- Gilbert Skippy (see the "Around in Ten" site)
-- Selway-Fisher Micro 8 and Micro 10

I guess Sand Flea is a sleep inside rather than a sail inside. But I can't imagine how a PDR would sail if it were a cube; which is basically what you'd have if you tried to fit a real cabin to it.
