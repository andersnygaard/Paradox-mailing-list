Subject: Re: How to attach an anchor to Paradox

This is important to remember, whatever system you have it is just an option, not a restrictive solution.

When I pick up a mooring buoy I have a huge snap hook which I fit to the end of my bow line. As I sail slowly past the buoy I hook it to the ring on top (or somewhere equally convenient). I can then get the sails down and tidy up. I then go forward and replace the bow line with a line that hold me much nearer to the buoy. By using a line doubled from a rear cleat I can cast off from the cabin.

You could easily use a fixed bow line for setting the anchor and then change to a different arrangement once settled.
