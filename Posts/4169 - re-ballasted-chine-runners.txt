One way to solve some of these issues (and I'm sure create more!) would be to forgo casting, glassing chinerunners altogether.

Could it be possible to bolt a large slab of steel, a bit like a wing under your paradox. You can shape it with a grinder to smooth the water flow. You could also make it somewhat wider than you might normally do, as a test. You could always lop some off so to speak.

A paradox, with a 2' X 6' 3/4" thick "wing" of steel might be an interesting way to get lots of ballast, and some chinerunner foils at the same time.
