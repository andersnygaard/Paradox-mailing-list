I didn't really use them for storage. even with all my cruising gear, including the bicycle, I have plenty of empty storage.

My problem was that the inspection hatches that I had originally fitted, while good at keeping water out, were not good at keeping water in. As an interim measure while I sourced some reliable hatches, I installed 70kg of lead in the sealed tanks. This would provide the same ballast as the water and, in the case of a swamping, would be neutrally buoyant.

I now have an arrangement that suits me. The hatches are watertight, I have fitted electric pumps inside the tanks to empty them and I have a loose pump on a wire to fill them.

When I want to row a long distance it is easy to empty the water out to lighten the load and then fill again when sailing is possible, and the weight when on the trailer is that 70kg less.
