My take on the answer (I am not an owner, only have the plans and have been paying close attention for several years): Two reasons. The hull is rather narrow, but has no weighted keel, so the weight some of it lead low and amidships) puts it deep enough to give the hull a wide range of stability--it's self-righting. Second, the hull iIS its own keel for purposes of lateral plane (greatly aided by chine runners), so it needs to be immersed deeply enough that it does not make too much leeway. There are not many good ways to make cruising boats of such shoal draft that are capable in open water; this is one.
