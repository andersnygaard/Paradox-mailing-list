Subject: Re: Great Loop?

True. It is primarily power. However, many have found that a sailboat, with its slippery hull and small engine is an extremely fuel-efficient (50% or more) means of doing the loop, although their masts have to be removed due to one (IIRC) 17' bridge clearance, and careful consideration has to be given to the draft.
