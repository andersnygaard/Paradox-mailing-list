I sent it off,

   You could also epoxy coat the parts, that would hold off rust for awhile too. You also might want to check out your local scrap yards for a piece of brass pipe.

hi Jack

I've checked out local galvanisers and there is a minimum charge of 
70. I think they just
don't want the aggravation of individual pieces.
I can always replace the piece as it rusts.  Galvanised pipe is very 
cheap, and often free, at
the local scrap yards.
Will you be able to send me a picture of your set up? I'd rather copy 
something that works.

Cheers  ....  Derek

Hi Derek,

   There is also a cold galvi spray product I have seen. I dont know how
well it works, and I have also heard of a product called zinga. To the
extreme I guess you could just have it hot galvinized, such a small 
part
could easily be done in a small shop. Black anodized steel would be 
slick.

Hi Jack

Thanks for your input; a picture would be perfect - a great help.

I wondered about epoxing the pipe ends to solve the rust problem and
I'd fit a soft metal
(copper?) cap at the end where the strut meets the deck.

Cheers  ....  Derek
