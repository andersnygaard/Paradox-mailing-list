I like the paradox a great deal especially the fact it can be beach landed however a little more space is need.
This boat 
http://www.duckworksmagazine.com/store/plans/jim/af3/index.htm seems 
similar in style but with a cockpit where our dog could possibly 
sleep.

The thing im wondering is if it would be as stable as the paradox.
Does any one have any thoughts on my points?

Bye for now.
