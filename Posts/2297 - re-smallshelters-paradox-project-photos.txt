Greetings Nel,

I might not Strip Plank the Hull-Haven't decided yet. I am on a very tight budget and don't want/won't pay the ridiculus price they are asking for Plywood nowadays--Unless I absolutley have to. I have all kinds of 2X4's 2X6's Etc. I can strip them up on My Table Saw-For Free.
The Bottom now has a layer of 3/8" Py on it, I was thinking of using Strip Planks over the Ply to bring it up to 3/4" thickness.
I am using Gold Deck Screws and Ring Nails, Titebond II Glue. Polyester Resin doesn't seem to bother Me, I did My Bolger Brick with It and had no reactions to it. And is seems to be holding up good.

Thank You,
Dave Blow
