Bring on the Edge of Shore

This past weekend I hooked up a topping lift. After the wind kicked up and the line got packed into a partially reefed sail, I was unable to mess with the sail in the manner I wished as I was tending to navigate "The Edge" between docks and other boats that jet out into the lake from the shore. The topping lift provided me with enough trouble that I renegotiated my thinking and removed the line after untangling it from the sail.

I found that grounding on a paradox is absent of drama. After reefing the sail, and removing the topping lift, I got jumped into less than knee deep water and pushed my boat out and jumped back on. Sailed away to my marina with reefed sail, and learned how lines can quickly become a problem.

I am sure that practice with the topping line is in order as well as other line management and technique. Perhaps in the future I may entertain the idea of the topping lift. For now, I am able to furl the sail by using the release halyard a few inches, pull reefing line, lift halyard a bit, repeat... I am really enjoying with the experimentation of lines, and techniques together.

Fairwinds,
