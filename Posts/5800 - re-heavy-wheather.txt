Hi Steve,

Pretty good compared to you folks in the NW USA. I live on the east side of the Coastal Range in south=3Dcentral BC, which doesn't get as much precipitation when the flow comes off the Pacific as the west side of the mountains get. And we sort of escaped the really cold temps getting down to about -25 C a few times. The lower Fraser River flooded east of Vancouver and did a lot of damage. Man - did northern Idaho ever get hit bad with both snow and cold and several snowmobilers died in avalanches in southeastern BC as well as elsewhere.
