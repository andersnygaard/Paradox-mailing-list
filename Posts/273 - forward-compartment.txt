Subject: Forward compartment

I am looking at drawing #7.

The whole in bulkhead two for access to the foward compartment looks a bit on the small side. I think I would get stuck.

The idea of accessing anything beyond bulkhead #1 seems pretty difficult.

Would someone with a Paradox please comment.
