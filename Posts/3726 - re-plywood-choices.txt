Subject: Re: Plywood Choices

Hi Joe. If you would go the the FILES section you can see some STUDY  
PLANS . The last item on the list is the Sail plans. If you print 
this out you can read what the designer says about plywood choices. 
My own boat, which I have just started, is made of exterior fir 
plywood since I plan for it to live 99 % of it's life sitting on the 
trailer. Have you ever built a boat before ? I shouldn't think a 
paved floor is necesary. There is an assembly scheme layed out in 
the "plans" which make it "self jigging" so to speak. Print out all 
the study plans and see what's there.
