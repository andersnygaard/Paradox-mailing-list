Subject: Re: To Hawaii?

Rod,

My first concern is for your preparation and your mental frame of mind. I suggest you first sign on as a crew on a voyage to Hawaii or some such place where you are exposed to the fierce and wild realities of the open sea. You will likely, I hope, have an experienced skipper to serve as a confidence booster/teacher. It can be scary and physically exhausting. In San Diego, you should be able to find a Yacht Club Bulletin Board with requests for Crew. Say you know how to cook! Then, after you come back home, you can answer your own question: Is the Paradox capable of such a voyage? The mind is the thing! Good Luck.
