Thank you, Andre for your suggestions and sharing your experience.

I had tested the yuloh with the rudder down, and now I shall also perform the test this weekend with the rudder up. Last night I applied epoxy to seal the inside of the socket. I placed a hose inside the socket as you suggested and will test again this weekend. I will also add weight to the boat and fill the water tanks with water to better get a sense of the motion of the boat when loaded.

I viewed a you tube video last night and I think it was Dave Buldoc who was demonstrating the yuloh technique. it appeared that he had a U shaped oar lock for the yuloh, but I wasn't sure. He is an expert as he had master control of the boat; slow, fast, steering, and it was all second nature.

In addition to the yuloh test, if I am successful to move the boat to the lake from the boat launch I shall test sailing. I am very excited about the sailing test; to learn to tack a boat with such a sail design and no keel will be fun.

Fair winds,
Deric
