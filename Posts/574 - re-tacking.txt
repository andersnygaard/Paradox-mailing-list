I might be sailing her to heavy? 400 lbs lead, most of it where the water tanks were to be 65 lbs of outboard 190 lbs of me. 6.5 gal fuel, 5 gal water, about 75 lbs gear,food,anchors, chain about (guess) about 750 lbs total. would this have anythig to do with her not wanting to come about ?

Hi David;

Have you tried falling off (pointing further away from the wind) to gain
some speed before trying to tack?

You might also be down by the head - do you have a lot of stuff up in the
bow? This can cause a boat to miss stays (I think that's the correct term)
:)

P.S. Did you happen to name your boat after Hal Roth's?
