Thanks for the idea!

You have to sort this out for yourself. 

My solution is to have a socket at the bottom of the
mast which 
can be extracted leaving a 20mm hole. At the top the
wire comes 
out through a hole just big enough for the wire and
is then sealed in 
place with silicone sealer. I hope this keeps out
the water, but it 
won't be tested in anger till next year.

The wire just hangs inside the mast (with padding to
stop slapping) 
so should be easy to replace. I just used 5 amp
flex. 

Thanks,
