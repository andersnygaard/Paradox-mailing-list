Subject: More topping lift pictures

Hi All,

I spent the week end running the topping lift lines thru deck and installing all the extra hardware required. I then went out and rigged the boat to make sure every thing worked............. and it did! While it was rigged I took more pictures of the whole affair and have posted them to the Topping Lift folder in the files section. They should clear up any confusion lingering out there.

Tailwinds,
Glen
