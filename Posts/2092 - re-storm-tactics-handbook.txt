Al, When I tack in light airs she will stop nose dead into the wind. Any
suggestions ?

I meant balance as in weight distribution. On a tack if I have too
much weight forward it hangs nose to wind, if too much weight aft it
won't come up into the wind.

How would you unbalance or balance the boat ? I have netural rudder
and the sail set so that if I am hit with a strong gust she will want
to head into the wind. I think I have my sail balanced right, but
still having trouble tacking in light air.

I've not tried heaving-to, though it is on my list of things to be
attempted.

I have noticed that if the rudder is fully raised then my boat
weathercocks till the sail is downwind. It occurs to me that if the
boom could be held in the desired position then the hull could be
made to lie at whatever angle to the sea that you liked.

Alternatively how about just having a couple of feet of sail up,
sheeted in fairly tight with the rudder turning it up towards the
wind. With such a small amount of sail up there wouldn't be enough
drive to get through the wind.

Another unconventional idea stems from the fact that if the boat
isn't balanced well I have trouble tacking, so if I unbalanced the
boat and set up for a tack I may well find I am hove-to.

Let us know if you find anything that works.

In light of the ongoing discussion on storm tactics, some may
find this book of value.

-1/ref=sr_1_1__i1_xgl14/102-3241667-9644135?v=glance&amp;s=books

Not that Paradox, as a coastal cruiser would likely ever see such
conditions, but it may stoke the belly fire of the armchair
sailor.
