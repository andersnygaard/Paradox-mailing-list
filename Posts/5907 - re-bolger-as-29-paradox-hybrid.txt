Subject: Re: Bolger as-29 paradox hybrid

Hi Gene, Andrew,

Indeed that is Jessie Cooper - which is almost an identical hull shape -
as an enlarged Paradox.

People inquired about JC being improved and the result was a new design
- the AS29. JC had a very heavy off-set daggerboard which could be a
problem if you hit something solid when it was fully submerged and
sailing at speed. It also had no handy location to mount an outboard,
and some other issues - all solved with the new design.

The problem as I see it is that both designs require a consider outlay
of money and time to build, and would one want to risk a chance that
chine runners would improve the performance all that much?

The largest hull with chine runners I think was Hogfish and a
centerboard was incorporated in the design - just in case - and
off-shore I believe - the centerboard was lowered for best upwind
performance.

Bolger also has written that the designed rig on the AS29 will
out-perform a junk rig. When a fellow built one and installed a junk rig
Bolger said it was no longer an AS29 and would not offer any further
comment. The builder later sold his version and the new owner is
considering modifying it again to turn it into a trimiran!

My impression is that a person must be very careful when changing a
proven design without undertanding all the issues that may arise as a
result.
