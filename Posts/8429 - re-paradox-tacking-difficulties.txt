Dave,

I'm sure you're right:  it's a fascinating development of the old roller-claw,  which disappeared from use because it rubbed a threadbare line in the sail.   Yours seems a lot kinder to the sail.
Using your attachment,  is it now possible to dispense with that complicated piece of copper tubing and tack-line in front of the roller?

I'm equally sure that my semantic ramblings will not improve it!

Best wishes,

John
