Hi Michael and Jack,

I live in Walpole MA, which is about a 45 minute drive north east of Warwick. I worked at the Raytheon defense plant in Portsmouth RI for a few years so I am familiar with the Newport area.

I don't own a Paradox, but I have purchased the plans and was planning on building one in the next few years, until I saw Matt's Enigma 460. I now think Enigma would better fit my needs.

I would be interested in corresponding with you both, since much of the construction is similar (scarfing, fiberglassing, sailmaking, identical sail rig, etc.) Your comment Jack, about the biax fabric caught my eye. Did you use biax cloth on the bottom of Jill Baby? I am thinking of using biax on my Enigma build, due to the added strength and reduced weight.

Thank you for your service, Michael. I attended the US Merchant Marine Academy, at Kings Point, many years ago, sailed on merchant ships and did 6 years in the Naval Reserve. Luckily the world was quieter then and I was never called up. One of my goals is to sail back to my alma mater in my hand built Enigma!

Regards,
Dave Raftery
