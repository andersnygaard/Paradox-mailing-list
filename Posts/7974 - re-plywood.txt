I got the plans from David Bolduc and the Paradox build book from Wanda Elliott. I have been searching for plans for a small boat that I could build and sail the Texas 200, the Everglades Challenge and to sail from Florida to the Bahamas. I first started looking at CLC boats the Northeaster Dory, but didn't want to be stuck out in the elements for the entire trip. Then I was looking a Jim Michalak's boat plans but I wanted something self-righting. I was on youtube and saw a video of the Paradox "Scout" and that sold me on the Paradox.
