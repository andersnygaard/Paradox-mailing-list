Subject: Re: Scout Update... Working it all out...

<p>I think I have to disagree with you john on the tacking angle and using the GPS COG function to figure it out. &nbsp;COG gives you your true direction of travel and automatically accounts for leeway and or tide or current. I am sailing in an area with little to no current or tide. I don&#39;t really care so much about the compass heading of the boat when I have the ability to use COG. Compass heading and true course are often quite different heading hard on the wind due to leeway. What I want to know is the true split between the COG on each tack and that paints a picture for me of the true tacking angle.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;">As for lighting....In the US here are the regulations:</p><p style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;"><br></p><ol class="ol" style="margin:0px;padding:4px 2px 2px 10px;border:0px;font-size:14px;line-height:18px;font-family:'Source Sans Pro', Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;color:rgb(80, 80, 80);"><li style="margin:0px 0px 6px;padding:0px;border:0px;line-height:16px;list-style:decimal inside none;">Sidelights are red (port) and green (starboard) and shine from dead ahead to 112.5° aft on either side.</li><li style="margin:0px 0px 6px;padding:0px;border:0px;line-height:16px;list-style:decimal inside none;">Stern lights are white and shine aft and 67.5° forward on each side.

They must be above the sidelights.</li><li style="margin:0px 0px 6px;padding:0px;border:0px;line-height:16px;list-style:decimal inside none;">Sailboats under power are considered powerboats.</li><li style="margin:0px 0px 6px;padding:0px;border:0px;line-height:16px;list-style:decimal inside none;">Sidelights may be combined into a single &quot;bicolor&quot; light.</li><li style="margin:0px 0px 6px;padding:0px;border:0px;line-height:16px;list-style:decimal inside none;">Powerboats less than 20m (65.5&#39;) in length need to show sidelights, a stern light and a masthead light.
