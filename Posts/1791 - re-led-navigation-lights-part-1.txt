Thanks for starting this Al, and for making it easy to understand.
When I spoke to you I remember you mentioning that you used 6 of 60 degree white LEDs. Would that be two rows of three in parallel?
Presumably, for 240mW a half Watt resistor is of ample size?
Lastly, what is the UK source for LEDs?
Best wishes......Derek
