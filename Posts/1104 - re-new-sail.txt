The sail is 5oz and made to Matt's specifications. Stuart studied the posting that Matt made and incorporated his thinking into the sail. He put as much draft into it as he felt he could get away with and still have it roll up for  reefing. 

Yes, DC, the tell tales are just aft of the mast and when I first saw them My reaction was that they would not be of much use. The sail trials proved me wrong as they work quite well. Stuart has a lot of experience with these sails as it turns out. There is a 17 boat fleet of Nutshell prams in Wicomico Church Va. where he has his loft. and he has built all of the sails for them. The fleet is made up of ardent old racers who are very competitive and want the most performance they can get. Stuart has had the advantage of sailing on the boats and talking to the skippers about what is needed ect.

DC, if you choose to build your own sail it is important to measure the bend in the yard so that you get the top correct. This was a failing in my old sail. While sailing with Matt, he commented that it looked like the sail needed about 2 inches of camber at the top. When I measured the bend by hanging fifty pounds of weight at the center while supporting the yard at the ends I found that there was exactly 2 inches. Matt sure has an eye for measurements. To get the camber pull a string tight across the ends and take measurements from the string to the yard at the quarter, half and three quarter points.

If any one out there has the time to add camber and pehaps some more draft to my old sail (Which is still pretty new) I am willing to let it go for $250, I paid $550 for it. If interested please contact me off list.

Tailwinds,
