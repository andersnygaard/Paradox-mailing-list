Subject: Re: Adding 3-4" to cabin top?

Hi Woody,

I did exactly that. I added 50 mm to the hull height and the cabin top will also be 50mm taller when it's done. As far as adding it to the hull, there were no issues whatsoever. I just added 50mm to everything and it all fit. Adding another 50 to the cabin top will mean it'll be a few mm narrower on top, but sizing those pieces is taken from the existing work, so that won't be problematic. As far as post construction factors go, there will be more windage - but for a moderate displacement cruising boat that doesn't matter to me.

I have seen domes on other boats (was it Sven Yvrind?) with some success. I had a plexi dome custom made several years ago - surprisingly inexpensive.

Regards,
Darren
