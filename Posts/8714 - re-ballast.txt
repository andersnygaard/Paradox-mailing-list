Yes, Stephen,

Stephen Barwell:

Earlier did you mean there is a Paradox being built now that will use a junk rig? Is that Paradox your Paradox? The physics of the junksail itself seem paradoxical and enigmatic. If you are the matchmaker I send my best wishes. I hope the Paradox and junksail engagement works out. Two wildcards that might make the perfect couple.
