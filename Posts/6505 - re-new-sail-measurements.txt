Subject: Re: New Sail measurements

Replying to myself here!
Just for info the measurements as specified are correct. I checked with Matt!
The tack angle is purposely increased to keep the sail up tight against the furling drum when the sail is rolled on the boom. He says that it tends to work it's way aft which is bad for balance and set. He actually unrolled his sail and checked the measurements as he hadn't guessed that the diagonals would have worked both ways.

He also assures me that a topping lift is neither necessary or desirable, so I'm going to try without to see how I get on.

Too late now as my order has gone in!

I've also specified that the grommets at tack,clew, throat and peak are in the sleeve, not above or below, as I think this makes more sense when attaching to the spars.
