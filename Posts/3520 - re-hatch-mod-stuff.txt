That wouldn't have worked in my case. All I had time to do was think "Oh s**t". We went from about 25 degrees to 90 degrees in about 3 seconds, and less than 10 seconds later were up and sailing again.

I would be concerned that the hatch might lift as it went over, letting in significant quantities of water. Some sort of fastening would have to be included. In fact, the more I look at it, the better the sliding hatch looks.
