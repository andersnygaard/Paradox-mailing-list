Hello amgraham2001,

Congratulations on successfully launching your Aussie Paradox! You have the honor of building the first Paradox to hit the water in your country.

Thank you for sharing your photos and sailing experience. The boat looks very distinctive and well-finished, and the sail looks great.

Regarding the tenderness, it seems to be an expected experience when the boat is lightly loaded. Stiffness should improve when all stores are on board. Please take notes on your voyage and share them with us, especially on how Paradox does in big winds and waves, and how well she gets to weather.

May I know what part of Australia you are located in and your name?

Thank you for sharing your experience and photos.

Best regards,
Nels
