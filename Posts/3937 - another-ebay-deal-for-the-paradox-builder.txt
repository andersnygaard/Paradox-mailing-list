Subject: Another Ebay deal for the Paradox builder

I recently bought a 50 yard roll of 4 oz E glass on Ebay for $35 (buy-it-now) item#: 170024129043. This weight cloth is excellent for handling complex structures like the toe rails. Normally this glass runs for up to $5 a yard if it is perfect, but of course the Ebay roll is not. There are some minor flaws that very occasionally pop up across the width of the fabric, and there is a slightly elevated thread that courses the whole length of my roll. Nonetheless, I've found the glass to be fine for making my own tapes and for covering smaller projects like a hatch. In fact, if you were careful, it might even be possible to cover the topsides of a Paradox in the 6 oz glass that they also sell. Lastly, I have no affiliation with the seller.

Here is my webpage showing how I used the cloth today:

Ebay item#: 170024129043 (Don't forget to look at this sellers other auctions. By the way, the shipping was very quick and the packing was fine except that my fabric did not come on a roll. In fact it was just wrapped around some cardboard so I ended up re-rolling it on a tube.)
