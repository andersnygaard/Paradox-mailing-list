Subject: Re: Plywood for Paradox

Wayne,

I used AC exterior ply for my Paradox, same as Matt and Glen. It will take a little more epoxy to achieve a good finish if you use AC exterior ply. I use Systems three epoxy just because I'm comfortable with it.

You might want to order the building manual from Don, its very helpful.

If you have any questions please do not hesitate to ask.

Happy Building

David Beard
