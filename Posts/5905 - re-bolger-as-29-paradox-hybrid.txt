The Bolger AS-29 is a different animal. It is a heavy ballast boat with pronounced rocker (bottom curve). When heeled any chine runner would not form a straight line like a keel but a half moon and create real drag in the water. They sail great as designed anyway.

Has anyone built a bolger 29 with chine runners ? Would it be feaseable . What would be the pros and cons . I am presently just dreaming of building one . I would like to combine the bolger and paradox with a ketch junk rig . 

Cheers
