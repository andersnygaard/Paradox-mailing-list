Subject: Mini Paradox idea

Hello to all on the list. I have bought the paradox plans and have spend much time with pencil, paper and calculator going over things. I am currently prepping my work area and thinking about the project. However, here is the rub.  I really want to go sailing now, and I can't find anywhere in my area that will rent me a sailboat for the lake I live near.

Whilst playing around with the paradox dimensions, mostly looking at a slightly enlarged version, I wondered about making it smaller also. I came up with reducing the size by .55. That would give you a boat at about 7.6 feet, 26" wide, and about 19" tall. You could end up using a sheet for the sides, a sheet for the bottom, and a sheet for the top, some bulkheads, and the transom. Then, I thought, do a quick build of a mini paradox, make it stitch and glue, make it quick, and get into the water before winter is her. I would forgo the fancy rounded top, and use some 1by stock to make bulkheads. The cockpit would end up being 42" long and about 22" wide. You would have to sit inside it, facing front and down somewhat in the hull, it could be comfy!. I'd still rig up a roped tiller to keep from reaching behind to steer.

So, I'm wondering if anyone thinks that lame, or I have my head in a dark place. I'm wondering if it would work OK. Should I go ahead and use a weighted centerboard, or just add weight to the bottom of the hull? I'm not looking for something fancy, I just want to get into the water and learn something in the process. I'm thinking building a mini paradox would: get me in the water, help me learn how to sail, get me comfy with the paradox style sail setup, and be a cheap and quick hull design to use.

So, what do you think guys (and gals)? Is it something worth playing around with?
