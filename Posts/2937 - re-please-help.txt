I'm sorry if I offended you in any manner with my impatince(sp?). It is to my understanding that most sailor's are just as eager as I to get into the water.
 
I can also relate to the Paradox being a "relaxed sail" as you so put it, but I still don't see what that has to do with wanting the plans to build her. Maybe i'm alittle to eager or perhaps I just voiced my opinion in the wrong spot or on the wrong subject.
 
In anycase I thank you for the link to their web site, however the e-mail as listed on their site doesn't seem to be working.
 
Again thank for the time.
