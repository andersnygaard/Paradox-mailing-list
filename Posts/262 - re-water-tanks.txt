Subject: Re: Water Tanks

Hi Dave,

I've never heard that west doesn't recommend using their epoxy for water tanks, Could be something new. I use a 5 part epoxy from Fiberglass coatings in St. Pete (800-272-7890) The only difference in it and WEST is the hardener (the pat. that WEST holds is for their hardener which is a little thinner). I have been using FC's epoxy now for about 9 yrs and have never had any problems. It's a lot Cheaper, about half.
