Hi Larry,

Maybe the Chief will have a minimum length of 15 feet next year.

I wonder if Matt happened to catch a couple of wind changes in the right place? I suspect that a Pearl with a 2 man crew and 2 rowing stations could be more competative. They could keep going 24 hours a day and have sufficient horsepower (OK manpower) to keep going in a calm.

The latest report from SnoreBringGator via Chiefs Wife:
He says he is on Cape Sable doing fine. Setting up to watch a nice sunset as a 21 foot Sea Pearl sails by.
Please enlighten me, none of my road maps show Cape Sable.
