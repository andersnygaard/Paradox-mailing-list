Subject: Re: 28 FOOT PARADOX LIVE A BOARD

Wooden Boat Magazine a few years ago, had an article on a 28 foot cold moulded sharpy type, but with rounded bilges and a centreboard. She also sported a free standing cat rig.

I have always thought a 28 foot PARADOX type would make a good liveaboard. Expanding the design by 200% will give you a displacement of 11,200lbs on a draught of 18" with a sail area of 400 sq ft.

But by adding a skeg aft you will be ineffect moving the centre of lateral resistance of the hull further aft, which will mean that the centre of effort of the sail(s) will have to move aft as well.

It might pay you to have a word with a local boat designer and ask his advice.

My thoughts on your project are that a schooner rig might be the way to go as the centre of effort for PARADOX's sail is a fair way back compared to similar boats, unless you can fit a small centreboard foreward.

Where are you building. The UK?
