G'day Shane

Seems to me if you use locale ply you need to rework bulkhead 3 by building it in two parts with a scarf on it bottom part. The side panel on the left on drawing 6 will not layout as dimensioned but there should be sufficient in the right hand panel to make up the shortfall on a 2400 long sheet. The aft bottom panel also is slightly shy on width in the area of the chine runners.

Using Gaboon gets around all these problems but presents the obvious ethical problems you refer to. I have been considering the use of Hoop Pine which has decent multiple veneers - considerably better made than Gaboon in my opinion. Another more toxic alternative is Proof Ply - glues and paints well and is very cheap but loaded with CCA or something equally nasty ;-))

Best regards
