The time for launching 'Faith' cannot be all that far off. I'm waiting for a nice warm day to complete the antifouling and after a week she can be launched. This will give time for the epoxy/copper antifouling to harden.

Meanwhile I've not been able to take any photos of the finished boat, as she's in the garage on her side until the temperature is above 18C which will permit me to apply the antifouling.

When updating the smallsailboats web site I included some photos of a few gadgets I have made for the boat. You can see them by going to the bottom of this page:
