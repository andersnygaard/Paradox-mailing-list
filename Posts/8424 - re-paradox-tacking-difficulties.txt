Hi Eerik

I thought that Chinese junks often had their masts sloping forward because then gravity encourages the sail to stay full when the wind is light and the sea choppy.

If I were building a Paradox I would make the chine runners as designed, as I don't know nearly enough to feel competent to change them.

Best
