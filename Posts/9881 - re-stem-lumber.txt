Hi Ben,

Many recommendations made by folks comes from a "bigger is better - more expensive is better" attitude. If you think about it, as long as the wood is kiln dried, is straight, free of big knots over 1/2 inch diameter or so and has no twist to it, I'd use it. Wood is wood when we are talking about solid wood. As long as it is free from the defects I mentioned, I see no reason not to use it. 

I have both Coastal and Interior Log Scaling licenses. A Log Scaler puts a price tag on a log between coming from the bush and before the saw mill cuts it up. The lumber grading is the next step along the line after the log has been cut into lumber. Yes, it's in place to give the buyer some confidence that the piece is free from the things I mentioned earlier and to tell the buyer that it might not be free from defects and of course will be graded accordingly... but don't kid yourself... The grading system is also there to make the manufacturer more money.

So trust your instincts, if it it's solid, straight, free of big knots and has no twist, I feel you would be pretty safe in using it. If you are really looking to save money, source a local "re-store" and see if you can find a piece of lumber that was used from a floor joist or similar from an old building that's been torn down. Chances are that board has been in a dry environment for the last 50 years or so and is in perfect condition with the exception of a few nail holes which are nothing to be concerned about.

Good luck, I hope this helps.

Ian
