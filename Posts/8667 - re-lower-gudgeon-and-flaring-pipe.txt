Thanks Al,

Haven't got to the battery quite yet, but I have been thinking about it. I was wondering whether those expensive deep cycle marine batteries are really worth it or whether just a normal 12V car battery would do the job, since it will be constantly being trickle charged by the solar panel.

At this stage, I was only planning on having it run a few LED's, a VHS radio on low transmission power (4w, I think they are) and perhaps a laptop. I also want to have a very powerful floodlight that plugs into the battery. Problem is I know that I'll probably end up wanting to use other electrical devices too. They do have a habit of multiplying!

Cheers,

Rob.
