Subject: Re: stretched paradox started today

Hello,

When you have time please tell us how you are doing the stretch. Are you increasing the beam and freeboard as well as sail area? What about the chine runners? Are they a percentage of the waterline length so would you increase them 25% as well? Are the chine runners centered on lwl or are they centered further aft?

I guess the rudder area is some percentage of the submerged area so you could the stretched to that percentage.

I like the idea of having a paradox-like boat at whatever length suits a person.

Thanks,
John Dean

Hello,

Just an update, so far I have all the bulkheads cut and have the two side panels scarfed. I used two and a half full sheets per side. I scaled beam length overall and freeboard all the same. I have just marked out scaled bulkhead positions on one side and put bulkheads on their side to check lines etc. All looks good so far. Yes, I am putting some stringers in before sides go on.

Before I go any further, I should say that this boat is based on a paradox and not simply a scaled-up version.

Cheers,
