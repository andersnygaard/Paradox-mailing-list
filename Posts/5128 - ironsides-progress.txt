Pete here you are, pictures. I have made and fitted the mast into it's home. And made it's hardware. The boom and it's harware are done too. Now I'm focused on the deck framing and I'm anxious to put the deck on.

The little stove I show here needs more work. I want to add a gaurd fence around it to keep the pots safe. The sole locker in the fwd stateroom needs to be installed. The pieces for it are getting painted just now. I have some nice thin plywood to panel the insides with. From the seat frame fwd to blkhd 2. Some 1-1/2 inch thick insulation foam will go in behind it.

I have 375 lbs worth on concrete bricks that will fit into the water tank place. They were 5 lbs each and .20 cents each. Much cheaper than lead, or iron. They fit nicley too. I wont install those until launch time. I still need to do the fiberglassing too. So I will need to roll the hull over etc. Making the mold for laminating the cabin and hatch beams will be worked in too. So far I have not laminated any beams. I have just sawed out the deck beams from 2 by 4 stock and left them 1-1/2 thick. Bouyancy and less work.

I must say all those angles in the cabin framing look like a headache!

Cheer, Steve Yahn
