A great simple and elegant solution.. good luck with your project. I'm jealous of of your organizational skills and time commitment. I seem to have neither at times.  Bill

Thanks Al and Will. I will bring out the wire from the aft face of the mast. The wire connection won't need watertiteness if I bring the wire upwards under the vent baffle ( just like the halyard and reefline ) and then socket in at a high location in the port side of the vent box. I did a search of the messages for this topic. There is lots of guidence. I should have looked there first. Cheers, Steve Yahn
