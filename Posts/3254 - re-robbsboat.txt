Intersting, now that you pointed it out. Looks a little wide for it's length compared to Paradox. Michalak always has an interesting take on his modifications of other designers boats. He has done numerous Bolger redesigns. I particullarly find the Cormorant (a 31 foot expansion of his Caprice design) an interesting approach to the shortcomings, perhaps, of the AS29 which was intended as a shallow draft near shore cruiser/livaboard  While the AS-29 is probably more seeworthy, it slaps miserably at anchor, weighs a lot and doesn't beach particularly well. It also doesn't steer well under power due to the motor being aft of the rudder post. 
The Cormorant is light and dries out nicely on the beach without danger of crushing its bottom due to a lighter load and the geometric shape of its entry makes it not slap. The motor well is forward of the rudder post providing thrust against rudder for more authoritative steering. It has a long slot cabin top similar to the Birdwatcher with a removable forward panel for great flow through ventilation and lots of forward access to standing headroom without the unweildly high windage of the Bolger box. For coastal and Bahamas cruising it strikes me as a much better simple solution to beach cruising with a modicum of seaworthiness as tendered by the prudent seaman. I am gaining more and more respect for Michalak's simple approach to solving problems.
