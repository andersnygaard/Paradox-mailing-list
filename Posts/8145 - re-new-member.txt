Hi Terry,
It sounds like you might be on the east coast. If so where ? I am in Sydney and interested in building a Paradox once I get a few other projects out of the way ....

Hi guys,
Thanks. Yeh I have seen the ASHIKI blog.
I picked up some more info from the archives here, no mention of the dismasting. It does sound like GD is a capable and low key Paradox sailor, shame he's on the other side of the continent from me.
Best, terry
