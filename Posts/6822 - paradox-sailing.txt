Hey guys,

I have a few questions regarding sailing in the Paradox:

1. Through how many degrees does she tack?
2. I know the avg speed on longer trips have been recorded as 3.6kts, but what is the top speed to be expected and what is her speed and roughly say an average of 12kts wind?
3. Have any of you had experience with a Junk rig for the Paradox?
4. How does she handle downwind and will one be able to use waves/smells to your advantage downwind to increase speed?

Thats it for now.
