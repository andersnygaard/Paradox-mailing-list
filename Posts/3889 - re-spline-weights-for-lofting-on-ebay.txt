Subject: Re: Spline weights for lofting on Ebay

Shipping was $14.26 to NC from NJ. I've seen these particular lead
duck sets sell from $20 to $61.  In my particular auction I was hoping
the price would stay under $30 because I knew the shipping would be a
little high.  On the other hand, you could always pour a set for
almost nothing by picking up old discarded tire weights or fishing
sinkers. I made up some small pigs of trim ballast for Swamp Thing
this way.  One last thing, I think the weights from splineweights.com
are probably a little nicer than the ones on Ebay, but they are much
more expensive. If you look at the picture on the bottom of the page
at http://physics.bgsu.edu/%7Elayden/FunStuff/Boats/Matt_Boat/05-02-12.htm
you will see that Matt Layden uses ducks that look a lot like the
splineweights ones.
