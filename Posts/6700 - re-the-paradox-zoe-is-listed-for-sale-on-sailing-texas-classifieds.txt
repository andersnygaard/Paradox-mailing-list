Congratulations Mark! Zoe set the gold standard. You have a beautiful Paradox.

I'm curious. Where are you located? You mentioned plans to sail in the San Francisco Bay. As a Paradox owner living in the Sacramento area I'd be interested in getting together with you if you'd like to sail in tandem over the summer. Since moving to this area I have only sailed in Folsom Lake.

Regards,
Mark W.
