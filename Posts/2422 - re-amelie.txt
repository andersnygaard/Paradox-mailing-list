Paul,

Anywheres near Radisson? Trying to locate the builder of an old Bolger Birdwatcher up there.

Radisson is quite a ways away. I remember trying to look that fellow up about 8 years ago but never got an answer at his number.
Do you remember his name? I think he actually used something other than plywood to built it with.

Cheers, Nels
