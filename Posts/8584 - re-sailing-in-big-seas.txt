Hi Nick

Thanks for posting that update and sorry to hear of the problems   Handling a Paradox is different to a normal sloop and there's a steep learning curve awaiting the new Paradoxer..

No Paradox in rough seas and with the sail deep reefed will make much progress to windward.

Having the sail reefed reduces its driving force and the short rough seas will tend to slow the boat down. There comes a point where the diminishing drive from the sail and the increasing braking effect of the waves are in equilibrium .When that point is reached the boat can only stop going to windward.

The more sail you have up, or, the better the cut of the sail,   helps.  But in 25knots of wind you're having to reef. There's nothing else that you can do..

The trick is to pick a destination that isn't directly into wind. Or, wait until the tide is going your way and hitch a free ride.. Or, to stay in sheltered water,  with little waves, until the weather improves.

Your problem with the boom.
Did you take up the slack in the topping lift before trying to reef?
If you leave the topping lift too slack the the boom will tend to catch on the hatch top if you let go the halyard. It's better to co-ordinate the operation of the halyard and furling line if so that there is always some tension on the luff of the sail.

Your motor sounds like disaster. Electric?. I use a 2.3 Honda and find it pretty good motive power although I've had some problems with it..

Best,
Jim
