Hi,

My original point, (over-simplified as Nels correctly pointed out),
was just to try and show that you shouldn't rule-out your own
human power, especially for such a small boat.
Remember also that many of the 'maintenance' functions of our 
food will have to go on even if you just sit there and do nothing.
That's like having an outboard using fuel even when its not in use!
So why not use it (body, that is)to help move the boat!
But I agree that there's probably no other readily-available fuel that has anything like the calorific value of petrol/gasoline.
Cheers,
Alan.
