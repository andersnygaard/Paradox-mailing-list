Hi Derek,

Here is what you wrote previously:

"Finish again! I am going to paint the very bottom red. The reasoning 
is: I have International Paints red from Caleb,"

I expect it is spelled the same no matter which paint you use.

However, just "SOS" would do it? 

Maybe ask your wife to explain it to you;-)
