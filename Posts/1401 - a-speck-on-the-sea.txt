Subject: A Speck on the Sea

Hi, 

I was interested to see that William Longyard is a member of this group.  I happen to be reading his latest book, A Speck on the Sea at the moment and just wanted to jump in and say that if you're a member of this group you would probably enjoy this book very much.  William tells the stories of dozens of amazing small boat voyages, many of which I have heard about but have always wanted to know the full story.  Like, for instance, the story of the amphibious jeep that circumnavigated the globe.  

Highly recommended.  Check it out.
