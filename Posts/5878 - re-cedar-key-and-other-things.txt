Subject: Re: Cedar Key and other things

Scott,
Welcome aboard. Where abouts are you?

Cedar Keys is an area on the West coast of Florida. It gets talked about on here because there is a small boat messabout every year, organised by the West Coast Trailer Sailor Squadron (WCTSS).
There been a few Matt Layden designs there in the past - Little Cruiser, Zoe and Enigma.

Here's a link to last years photo's

Don's manual can still be obtained from the same source as before.
On the other Paradox builders group, Don's widow posted the following:
----------
I'm Wanda his wife and he wanted me to continue to make his
instructional materials available to the public for purchase.
Unfortunately, I have limited knowledge of boat building so I will be
unable to answer any related questions. Procedures for ordering
materials will continue as normal, although initially there may be
some delays. Please withhold any orders until after Jan.1 2009
                                          
                                          Sincerely, 
                                          Wanda Elliott

Has anyone built the bigger Paradox? Not to the best of my knowledge.
