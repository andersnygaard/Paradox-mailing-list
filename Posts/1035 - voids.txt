Hi All,

I just got through laminating another 1/4 of ply on Whispers sides. I think it went on really well. I epoxy coated both surfaces with straight epoxy and then smotherd it with thicked epoxy (silica) and nailed to bulk heads and logs, and a few dry wall screws in between where there was nothing to nail too. 

I dont think I have any voids, hard to tell. If I do have a void or two what kind of problems if any will it cause ?

That extra 1/4 inch sure made a difference. Thanks !

David
