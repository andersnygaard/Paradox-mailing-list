Hannu (http://hvartial.kapsi.fi) uses baking flour.

I'm sure you're right,  Frank.
That's why I prefer it.

I have no evidence,  but,
creating spaces in the resin with microballoons puts less resin in the joint:  it's cheaper.
A porous material (like wood dust or baking flour) uses more resin.   It makes the resin more viscous,  less fluid,  thicker;  and fills the joint.

No?

Wood dust being porous doesnt extend the resin so its hard to sand.
Micro balloons and proper fillers are cheaper than epoxy
Jus sayin

I remember reading in Messing About in Boats that someone was using wood ash to thicken epoxy. Also, more than a few years ago.
