Hi Jack,

I've just uploaded some pictures and a diagram showing my setup to the Files area.

The pump I'm using is a fresh water 12v self priming diaphragm pump. It flow rate is low enough that you could easily fill a water bottle with it. I'm securing the pump to the bottom of the boat under the forward stateroom floor and all the hoses and valves which are very light, since you can pump the water out of them, I'm storing in the forward starboard side bin.  

I'm using a bucket as an intermediary in the same way that you have a header tank in your house to fill your low pressure hot water cylinder (I'm not sure that you have low pressure hot water cylinders where you're from).

Cheers,

Rob.
