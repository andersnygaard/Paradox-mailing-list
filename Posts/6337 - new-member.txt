Well i have just recived my building manual via pdf files, printed and bound in a file. Have a warm open fire place, carpet slippers and dog by my side. Now for the next few nights reading and trying to place things in my head. 

I have also sent for the drawing and looking forward to seeing them. Just hope i've not bitten off more than i can chew with this build. Having only built a welsh coracle and now finishing a ken simpson kayak for my young lad. thats all my knowledge of boat building.

all the best Dave
