Our aircraft group has a Donations thing built right into it on Groups.io I'm not sure if that's part of the Groups.io thing or what. It keeps a Talley of how much money has been donated. One of you group owners can find out about that. We had enough money donated the first day or two to pay for 5 years. 
The reason they jumped the price up was to pay for all the new servers to contain all the data from hundreds or thousands of groups leaving yahoo.
