Subject: Re: Hull Panels

I concur with the other who say that scarfing, for the complete novice (me)is a somewhat intimidating process. I remember the feeling of impending doom as I took my plane to the side panel scarfs. It was only once I got started that I realised that "this ain't half has hard as it looks". By the time I'd finished the sides the bottom panel presented me with no challenge at all (other than being one tough cookie to plane)

As Matt says in his Enigma build pages 
"After doing these taped butt joints that everybody says are real easy, I confirm my personal belief that glued scarfs are faster, easier, cheaper and bend fairer"
