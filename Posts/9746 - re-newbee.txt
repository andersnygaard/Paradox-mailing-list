Hi Steve,

I own two Paradox sailboats and live in Saguenay Qu=C3=A9bec. I have sailed in Ontario=E2=80=A6

One of my two boats I loan to friends because I like to sail in company, but since it isn=E2=80=99t getting enough use, I=E2=80=99m considering selling it, but I=E2=80=99m not sure yet. Last year a friend and I sailed around lake St-Jean in six days and we sure had a great time! Thinking of circumnavigating huge Manitoulin island on Lake Huron and also spending a few weeks on Bras d=E2=80=99Or lake in Nova Scotia, depending on when or if my friends are available.

Terrific cruising boats, no hesitation in using them to coastal cruise the Great Lakes.

The enigma owner in Ontario is Tom Pike, I would sure like to know how to contact him because I want to build an enigma clone this winter, as a faster alternative to my Gorfniks to go explore places where there are no boat ramps.

Happy New Year, good luck with your project!
