Subject: trailer for paradox

Hi all,

I have seen Al's trailer up close and am hoping to get something suitable at less cost.
I have a dinghy trailer available that has a large transverse leaf spring suspension, but I'm not sure that it is up to the weight of a laden Enuf. Also, the wheels aren't braked; is this necessary?

Whisper and Zoe seem to sit on fairly ordinary looking trailers and I wondered if I could get any information about them? Dimensions, suspension, handiness for single handed launching, etc. would all be helpful.

Any help apprecaited.

Thanks......Derek
