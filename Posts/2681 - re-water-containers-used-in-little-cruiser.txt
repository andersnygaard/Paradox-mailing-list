Subject: Re: Water containers used in Little Cruiser

We use one quart water containers that fold up flat. These fit perfectly in our bilge, and they are very similar in contruction to the clear plastic ones that you can get in the 2.5 and 5 gallons size at K-mart and many outdoors sporting goods stores. Incidentally, we use two 2.5 gallon cubes to top off our smaller cubes and to supplement the ones in the bilge. Unfortunately,however, the smaller plastic cubes are no longer available as far as we can tell.  We got our original ones from Campmor (in New Jersey) and from Adventure 16. The nice thing about these discontinued square cubes was that once you finished one up, you could fold it up and put it away. Then, in it's place you could replace the missing ballast with more food or anything else that was heavy. Someday, when our supply of these wear out, we will probably have to use round water bottles which take up more space.

Hi Dave,
I've read about your using small water containers. What size and brand are they? 
Cheers Daved
