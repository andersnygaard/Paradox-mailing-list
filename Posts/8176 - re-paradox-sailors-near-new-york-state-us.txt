I also have both the plans and the build manual but haven't started mine in PA yet either.  I would be tempted to save the mast, booms, and other sailing parts until last since a boat could be used without the sails but the sails couldn't be used without the boat.  Of course I previously built a little Summer Breeze boat that I still didn't complete the sailing parts for and a one-sheet boat of my own design that I only built enough of the sailing bits to try it out.  Had I made those parts first then I'd be done with them now but I did get a fair amount of use out of both boats without the sails.

If you might be impatient enough to test out the Paradox without the sails I'd say build the mast and other parts last and get something that at least starts to look like a boat first.  Just my opinion as a wanna be Paradox builder.  To be honest I'm more likely to build something like the Enigma since my boating would be mostly in a small lake and river and probably never see saltwater.
