Hi David,

Thanks for your comments. I am currently located in Brisbane, Queensland - East coast of Australia. You do not want to be here during Summer, today it COOLED DOWN to 32 degrees C. Night's are hot too. Winter here is great, just like Bahamas apparently - thats what Dave and Mindy have been telling me.. We get 25 degree maximums (C) and clear sunny days for weeks on end. Only cold nights with some westerly winds get down to about 8 or maybe 6 degrees C.
Yeah, I cant wait to finish building her, there are so many places up and down this great coast of ours to sail her.
Luckily, we arent going anywhere near the bushfires, although couple mates of mine have been called off course down near Wagga to help fight the fires. Brisbane is about 1000km/600mile north of the fires, and our exercise area is about 80km south of Brisbane, middle of the scrub. Had a good rain lately though, so no worries about fires.

Chris.
