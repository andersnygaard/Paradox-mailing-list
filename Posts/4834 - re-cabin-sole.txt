Subject: Re: Cabin Sole.

On NOLI I will simply drill two small holes through the outside of the cabin, through the wash board edges and then the retaining lip.
To secure the wash board I just insert a round headed bolt with the head outside and on the inside fit a wing nut and washer.
Solar vents. If you look in my NOLI folder you will see that I have one on the fore deck in place of the vent trunk that is in PARADOX.
Lets hope the nights will not be too warm as I don't think they work very well with moonlight ;-)

Think small. Think MicroCruiser.
