Hi Bill/Al.
You don't need to spend a fortune on an underwater digital camera.
I bought one of these cases, made in Japan, on eBay for my FUJIFILM F20.
The case works to 10 metres underwater.
There are several types for different sized compact cameras. So you will have to go through their list to find your camera.
Cost just under =A320 including P&amp;P on a BUY NOW.
