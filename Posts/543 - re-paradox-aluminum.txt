I can't see why you would want to! Paradox is designed to be made of wood/ply. A good aluminium boat would be designed to be made of aluminium. To use a different material seems to be throwing away the designers skill.

Can you remember back to when fibreglass boats were becoming popular? There were some abominations where a nice wooden boat had been used as a plug for a fibreglass mold. Then later they began designing in fibreglass and some very nice boats appeared

Anyone have any ideas about an aluminum Paradox?
