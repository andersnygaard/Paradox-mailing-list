I'd have been drier, warmer and far more comfortable aboard Faith.  
Under those circumstances there is little one can do other than keep 
oneself fed and rested as much as possible - don't forget to drink 
plenty of water to stave off seasickness.  The boat is at the mercy 
of the elements, and providing there is searoom she will usually 
survive; the weak component is the crew.  Look at the Fastnet Race 
where yachts were abandoned, only for their crews to perish in 
liferafts, but the vessels were found afloat, although partially 
flooded and with broken gear.

Normally Paradox would not be required to undertake an open sea 
passage of 300 miles plus, but if she were, she should be equipped 
with spares for things that may break or wear and there are few of 
them, because she has been so well thought out.  I suppose if I were 
doing an ocean passage I would take a spare spacer for the tack 
arrangement and maybe fit a second halyard on a separate external 
block.  In the bosun's chest I would have an epoxy kit and a few bits 
of wood, along with screws and an assortment of nuts and bolts.  
Mastic and canvas may also be useful, plus thread, needles, twine and 
cords.  The tool box would contain an adjustable spanner and a 
Molegrip, along with a hammer, screwdrivers and a mini-hacksaw.

I was surpised to hear that Jimmy Lu's tiller broke, because the one 
shown in the plan should have been strong enough to cope with any 
relevant forces.

There's nothing I would change for offshore use.  Matt prove Paradox 
could cope.
