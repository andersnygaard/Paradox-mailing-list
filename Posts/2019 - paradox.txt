Subject: Paradox

DC, I would commit 7 different kinds of mayhem to see a paradox under construction. I live in Wa State but my wife has friends that she visits in the Portland area. I would really like to see your paradox sometime if that would be possible. It looks like you are really building to a very high standard.
