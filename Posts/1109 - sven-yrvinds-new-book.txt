Subject: Sven Yrvind's new Book

Hello Group!

Last week I received Sven's new BEAUTIFUL book. I have not finished it yet. Just wanted to inform you that there is a chapter covering Paradox, chine runners and Sven's cooperation with Matt. To those of you in command of "Scandinavian": get it! Too bad the audience is limited. If someone would translate it to English (obviously not me!) her or she would do the international small boat society a great service.
