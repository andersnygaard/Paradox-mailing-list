This is getting intriguing. A decked Goose with a rag top. I wonder what you'd do in a capsize? Hmmm.... Several PDRs have done the Texas 200 or whatnot with little night cabins of one sort or another. The most promising looking of that lot, I think, was named Ranger. I'd stay away from car-topping such a monstrosity, and away from having bolt-on bits, though. I have a Piccup Pram, Bebe, that's technically car-toppable at 112lb, but is an ordeal getting up and down without help, and takes as long or longer at the ramp as my big trailer boat. I made a cute little wooden dodger for Bebe last year and took her out of Bullocks Cove, East Providence, anchoring overnight in Occupessatuxet Cove (Warwick), before heading upriver the next day all the way to the Providence hurricane barrier (closed, unfortunately). The dodger kept some spray off me underway and the wind off overnight, but added fully half an hour to my set-up time at the ramp. Now I plan my boats to be as quick at the ramp as possible -- so I'll have time to use them and want to use them! Someday maybe I'll make the little dodger more permanent and get a little utility trailer for her.
