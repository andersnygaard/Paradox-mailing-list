If you are going to sail where the beaches are rocky, as I do. You might want to consider putting some roving on the bottom of the top half of the rudder. ( Below the swim step) It takes a real beating, I had pieces the size of Dimes taken out. 

What do you think of the idea of splitting some copper pipe and capping the leading edge of the rudder with that?

I had also thought about adding longitudinal strips of steel strap as thick as would bend easily to the curve of the bottom of the hull.  Probably 8'-10' in length. Epoxy glass coat of course. The idea being more protection and addition of outside ballest.

Max has made a few comments of having to load the boat heavily to get the thing down to its water line.

Any thoughts?
