Subject: Paradox registry

I don't believe the Paradox registry 'database' has been updated in a while. Well, I did make one update today.

I switched my home computers to Apple a few years ago. The last year or so, it is hit or miss on being able to function with Yahoo Groups. This weekend was the first time in a long time that Yahoo Groups have functioned correctly on my Mac. So I am a bit out of touch, particularly for the most recent launches.

If you have time and are able to look the registry over, please do. I don't recall who can edit it. Probably me and the moderators.

Keeping it up to date would be helpful, particularly for somebody on the fence about building a Paradox. It may be worth a drive to look somebody else's over.

Please note on this thread any updates that need to be made to the registry. Also, let's keep this post to just registry comments. The last one went in a few different directions.

Respectfully,

Bobby

P.S. You may notice that I am now on the short list of Paradox owners, but not on the esteemed shorter list of builders. Mike was kind enough to agree to sell his 2nd build to me yesterday. A while back, I had attempted to buy his 1st build, but circumstances got in the way. Curious to see if he builds a third someday. I suspect he might.
