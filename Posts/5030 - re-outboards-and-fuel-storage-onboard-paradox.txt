Subject: Re: Outboards and fuel storage onboard Paradox

I would use one of these Alan, an Air-X Marine Mx-1 Wind Generator. 

http://www.defender.com/product.jsp?path=-1%7C328%7C337248&amp;id=336586

400 watts at 12 volts in 9 mph of wind, should be adequate for what we are discussing. I've seen them as cheap as 500 dollars from some discount houses.

This generator and 4 very good batteries could be used to replace the lead ballast in a Paradox and supply plenty of power for all the little things on a boat that size.

Hi,

Don't wish to be a doomsayer, but-
Unfortunately the numbers do not add up when looking at
electric power as your only system.
Solar panels wont be adequate for replenishing batteries
if these are to be used for propulsion and cooking,
and a wind generator would need to have blades of 6' and
upwards in order to get any useful amount of
power-impossible on a tiny
Paradox-size boat.
You could get upto 100watts from a pedal-powered
generator...
or a water-powered one if sailing with plenty of
wind might
be useful without slowing you down too much. Some of
these are
designed to be towed behind the boat, so no
complicated transom 
mounting required.
If the micro-wave mentioned is only about 50%
efficient, I'd expect
a simple immersion heating element could be more
efficient if used
in a very well insulated container to reduce heat
losses. A resistive 
(immersion heater) element is 100% efficient-all the
power it uses 
ends up as heat- so if you manage to not lose any of
that, I think it 
would be a better bet. Perhaps make up something
using a thermos as 
the heated vessel?
Having said all this, an electric cooker of some
sort could be good 
to have as a VERY occasional thing if conditions
were so bad that the 
gimballed gas stove was not safe to use.
Cheers,
Alan.

This is exactly the reason that I think electric
auxiliary power is a better option on something this
small. The stove is always going to be to close to the
outboard fuel supply for my tastes.

My idea was to replace a large amount of the useless
lead ballast with some very useful deep cycle
batteries. A small wind generator would be adequate
for charging the battery bank and the batteries could
be used for a lot more than just running the electric
outboard.

Some of the new radar system a very small and
light weight. An amateur radio for calls home. And of
course a way to keep the ever essential computer/gps
navigation system alive. 

And a small inverter and you can also have a limited
amount of AC on board for other essentials.

On something as small as the Paradox I think that
everything needs to provide some added value,
including the ballast.

When the Paradox is docked in the side yard next to
the house the wind generator and battery bank can
provide some useful backup power when needed,
which is all too often in my area.

Just my two cents worth ... Denny

Bill and all,

I have been reading for the second time Gerry
Speiss's account of his 
west to east Atlantic crossing as well as following
Bill Sergeant's 
cruising blog aboard Faith, both of which I'm
enjoying immensely.

In Gerry's book he makes notes about his distress at
the odour of 
fuel in the cabin space of Yanky Girl despite the
fact that his fuel 
cans were not leaking. I read that Bill has recently
lost the filler 
cap for his Honda outboard overboard!

All of which prompted my cuurent line of thinking
about the location 
of fuel on board Paradox.

As I'm at the pre-build stage at the moment, it
would be nice to 
design a space in her stern for fuel storage but
avoid the smell of 
fuel in the cabin.

Could fuel 'bins' be built in the port and starboard
quarters much 
like the water tanks in Paradox's design, where
filler caps and vents 
would be placed on the quarter deck and sealed off
from the cabin 
space?

Bill, how are you finding this situation aboard
Faith? How are others 
dealing with it aboard their micro cruisers?

Greg
