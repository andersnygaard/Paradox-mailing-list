Thanks, Bill,

There's no panic. I'm just happy you know about the problem:)

It's one of my favourite browsing sites. Lots of good links which are not always elsewhere, like UK Dinghy Cruising. I enjoy their adventures vicariously and there is so much really useful information. I have bookmarked it separately of course.

And your own sailing life is fascinating. I'm afraid I've been an armchair sailor for far too long. No longer, though!

Cheers,

Tony.
