Hi Chris,

You will save a lot of time and get a smoother cut if you pre coat your ply in the virgin state, it is more wasteful of epoxy but the savings in time is worth it (I think). When coating use a squeegee to spread the epoxy, it is much faster then rolling and is more economical as the epoxy will go farther. Keep in mind the first coat should be heavy because that is the one, which will soak into the wood. You will find the subsequent coats to take a lot less epoxy. Coating small pieces will be inevitable and a little trick I use is to make up paint/glue boards out of scrap ply, put at least three long sheet rock screws in the ply in such a way as to hold the part you are working on. Now coat one side and lay the wet side down on top of the screws and do the other side as well as the edges. When you remove the part you will be hard pressed to find where the panel lay on the screws because the screws are so sharp. To get a really glossy finish, tip the follow on coats with a foam brush or make your own by cutting down a foam roller into say three-inch lengths and then cut those into three sections. Make a handle by putting a slot in a piece of scrap wood that will hold your cut roller section. Using this method will allow you to always have the right size brush for tipping.
