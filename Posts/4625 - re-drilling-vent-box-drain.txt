Subject: Re: Drilling vent box Drain

Thanks for all the advice. In the end I drilled a hole for a 22mm dia pipe.
It all went surprisingly smoothly apart froma heart stopping few minutes when I lost the drill bit off the end of the bit extension. 
This happened probably within about 25mm off the bit breaking through the bottom. I luckily manged to retreive the bit by devious means and all ended well. The tube fits like a glove.

I've now completed my wet assembly of the basic hull and its all nailed up and curing nicely as I type. I'll move onto the sheer strakes next before I turn her over for the bottom work.
