Subject: Central tank divider

It wasn't until I placed the dividers/floor supports in their dados, preparatory to gluing, that I realised the central tank divider was off-centre to the port side of the centre line of the boat - correctly, according to the drawings of bulkhead #2, and bulkhead #3 - therefore the capacity of the port tank is marginally less than the starboard one, and, of course, the block containing the drain pipe within the port tank makes its capacity even less.

I know this will make little difference to the trim of the boat, but when looking at the dividers/floor supports, it is noticeable that the central divider between the lockers under the floor of the cabin is not in line with the tank divider. This came to me as a shock and it caused me to check Matt's drawings to assure myself I had got it right. I came to the conclusion that the construction drawing of the plan view (sheet 4) showing the tank dividers down the middle of the boat must be incorrect. When I further confirmed my conclusion by looking at photos of how other people had built their boats I felt at ease again.

Bill.
