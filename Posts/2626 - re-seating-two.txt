Subject: Re: Seating two?

After pondering this problem of sailing 2 up I decided the most comfortable system would be to have a 'soft-top' the full length of the cabin and fit another bench seat forward of bulkhead 3. then part or all of the roof could be removed. Unfortunately by the time I had worked this out I had already fitted the as-designed roof.

This would reduce the security (theft) and seaworthiness slightly, but not to that of a conventional dinghy
