I don't drink the ballast water either. The first year I filled it from a tap every time and when I cleaned it out at the end of the season there was an interesting slime left in the tank. No, if there isn't a tap handy, I will often fill from whatever I am floating in (using an electric bilge pump). This gives me the option of cleaning it out and filling with drinking water if I want to make a *long* trip.
