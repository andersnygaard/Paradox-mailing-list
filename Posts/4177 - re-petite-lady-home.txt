Thanks for your update. what you say is very reassuring.  I'm just a 
couple of years older and my boat 'Faith' is in the course of being 
built.  She has been built according to plan, except I have no 
insulation.  Her decks are in place and when the warmer weather comes 
along I shall try to fihish her for sailing in the summer months.  
Just at this moment there's a fall of snow.  So building has come to 
a halt.

Cheers,
Bill.
