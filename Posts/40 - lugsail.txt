Dear Glen and group,

This group is an excellent idea, Glen!
You have been very helpful in the past answering my questions on another forum.
I got the plans from Dave Bolduc, not with the intention of building a Paradox, but as a source of inspiration for a bigger, two person micro cruiser, which I am currently designing. Already it is clear my design will be quite different from Paradox, but the spirit will be the same. Perhaps I should call it "PARODAX" :-)

Anyway, I'm still trying to understand the functioning of the Paradox rig.
As far as I can see, there's nothing holding the yard to the mast, apart from the halyard. There seems to be no 'parrel' or something similar to prevent the yard to blow away from the mast, as in conventional Lugsails.
Can someone with a better understanding explain a little?
Another question about the rig is: how is the sail fastened to the rolling boom?

Best regards,
Bert.
