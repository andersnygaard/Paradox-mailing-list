Subject: Re: Stretched Paradoxes Sailing?

It's difficult to make comparisons.
No-one use the two systems on the same boat;  there are no 'boat-on-boat' tests.
You have an open mind;  we look forward to your data.

This past weekend my son and I sailed a 1932 built boat,  with a balanced lug,  on the Broads.
We were astonished at how well it sailed and how high it pointed.

As to leeboard and fin keel,  it's easy to arrange the same aspect ratio for both.
It's actually about aerofoil shape (perhaps hydrofoil shape!).
Fin keels must always be symmetrical,  but leeboards can be asymmetric and arranged to give high lift to windward.
Fin keels lose apparent area as the boat heels;  leeboards,  at an angle,  can increase apparent area as the boat heels.

Junk rig?  You clearly don't read the JRO's results!  Read some of Slieve McGalliard's results.

Marconi is entirely irrelevant to the discussion;  it refers to the way the mast is stayed.
You might have meant Bermudan?

Best wishes,

John
