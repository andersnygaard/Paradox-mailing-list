Subject: Re: San Fran area Paradox

Somewhere I read about someone building a full size model out of cardboard to get a feel for the size of the boat. I think it was a Paradox or might have been another of Matt's designs. I can't find the post or website that I saw that on but it might be an option for a non-floating model.

I keep thinking of making a model possibly just a box the approximate size of the main interior space just to see how it feels inside that size space. If I can find big enough pieces of cardboard and duct tape that should work or just a quick wood frame covered with a tarp. I might even build something a little stronger that would fit in the bed of a small pick up truck and actually try to camp in it. I'd hate to spend the time and money to build this boat for real and then find out I can't stand being closed in a space that size. I've gone backpacking before with a tiny pup tent so this boat should be better than that but I can't get a good enough idea of the size just by holding a tape measure beside me.
