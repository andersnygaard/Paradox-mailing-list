Great site. I love the story about your shake down cruise. 

Hello everyone, I finally got around to getting a web site up and have posted pictures of Zo there. I'll add comment to the images soon and try to get some construction shots uploaded. The site can be found by following this link: http://home.alltel.net/ifida/home.alltel.net_000001.htm
