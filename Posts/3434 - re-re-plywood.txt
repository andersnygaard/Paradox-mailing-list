Hi Derek,

All of my boats have been built to last, since they have been made of marine plywood. Such vessels whether painted with good quality marine paint or epoxy should have a life expectancy of 20 years or more, that's providing the construction engineering is up to spec.

As has been mentioned, the sealing of the end grain and edges of plywood sheeting is a must to prevent the ingress of water.

The exterior of the hull of my 50/50 was epoxy coated and most of the interior; certainly all parts below the waterline had 3 coats. The whole of the canoe was finished with 5 coats of International marine paint. If she's looked after and kept under cover when not being used, she should be good for many years.

Regarding Paradox, whether she is made of exterior or marine grade plywood, she should be heavily sheathed with fibreglass. The plans (sheet #5) show 4 mm of fibreglass and the sides and deck have one layer of fibreglass sheathing.

No water or moisture will penetrate 3 coatings of epoxy, and for protection from the elements, the epoxy should be painted with several coats of suitable paint that will bond with the epoxy. (Check with the manufacturer.)

Bill.
