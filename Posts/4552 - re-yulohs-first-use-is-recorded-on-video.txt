Looks to me like you had a lot less trouble with it then I did when first starting out. Using it is now a thing I don't even think about. You will find that when you relax and just move it back and forth it will do the falling leaf pattern by it's self. I still find myself wanting to twist it on occasion (all toughs years of sculling), but it works much better if I don't. Thanks for the clip.
