I can tell you what I have done. I buy oil-base enamel. I get Rustolium paint enamel. It is inexpensive. It is very durable. I put it right on the wood after all the building is done put before the deck goes on. I don't put any fillets anywhere except in the vent trunk and the vent baffle on the transome. There is plenty of expense as it is without looking for more special things to buy. I think I payed about $7.00 a quart. Enamel seems to me to be hard and more durable than acryic latex.
