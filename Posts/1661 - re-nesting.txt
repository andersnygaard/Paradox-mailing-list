Ok, the files have been uploaded into the Files section under CAD files. You will need the "Hull Designer" program from Gregg Carlson (free) which can be found here: http://www.carlsondesign.com/#Fun_Shareware for the Paradox.Hul file and a 3D Cad program (intellicad 2000 is great) for the 3D Paradox.dxf file. Have Fun!
