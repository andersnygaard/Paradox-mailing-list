Could you elaborate on the term "tufnol"? I have never heard of that before.

Thanks, Nels

Tufnol is an engineering composite of (I think) linen and resin. It is easily machined and doesn't react with many chemicals but is quite expensive. It looks a bit like bakelite if that helps.

Have a look at www.tufnol.com

I find it jolly useful for boat construction. It comes in blocks and sheets and we have a lot of offcuts at work :-)

I used the tufnol rather than building my own composite fitting as shown in the plans simply because I had a lump big enough. I imagine it behaves much the same though.
