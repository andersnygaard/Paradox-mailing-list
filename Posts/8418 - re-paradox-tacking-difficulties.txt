I've added a photo of my temporary boom vang in the photos section under Dave's Sharpie Stuff.  Basically it's a PVC pipe that has a segment removed to allow it too slip over the boom and the sail.  The inside of the pipe is lined with 1/4" foam to prevent damage to the sail, and there are different attachment points of the pipe for port and starboard.
