Subject: Re: Variations

I would recommend you make all the bits and pieces first (mast, rudder etc.) The reason is two fold. 1: If you are restricted for building room you haven't got the finished hull getting in the way. 2: It is psychologically better as once the hull is finished you are ready to go sailing immediately instead of having the hull sitting there tempting you while you mess about with fiddly bits.

One thing I didn't do, but would do next time is to make the chine log from 2 laminates (as suggested in the plans) or else steam the chine log into approximate shape before fitting.

One thing I did, which wasn't in the plans, but worked well, was to assemble the vent box onto bulkhead 2 before starting the hull assembly. I did this as I was working in a garage. Fitting the mast would have been difficult with the low headroom, not to mention the effort of lifting the mast in and out to check the fit. With the vent box on the bulkhead the mast and bulkhead can be set up horizontally on trestles and simply slid in and out while adjusting the fit.
