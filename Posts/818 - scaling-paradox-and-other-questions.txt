Subject: Scaling Paradox and Other Questions

I searched the message archives for opinions on scaling Paradox to fit two comfortably (or at least one tall guy like myself), but I did not find any definitive answers. So: Will scaling the Paradox (indefinitely) change the way the boat performs in a negative way? If one takes into account all factors, such as scaling up the ballast, sailplan, etc. could you make this an 18-20 foot boat safely?

Pardon my ignorance, but I'm not an engineer or a naval architect, so my knowledge of these dark arts is nil. 

One other question: To add stability and self-righting capability (at the expense of super-shallow water sailing), could you add a ballast keel or bilge keels without totally destroying the boat's theoretical performance? Is the boat self-righting if built to plan?

I am attending boat-building school, beginning in August 2003, and I want to build something to reward myself.
