I would think a cambered junk would do extremely well on a Paradox as it=92s so longitudinally stable, almost like a full keel boat. The one I built for my Marples 3m sea clipper tri does pretty well to windward. Not as infinitely reefable as the standard rig, but very easily reefable and maybe not as finicky seeing as how the mechanics are ancient and well proven/thought out.

Perhaps the cleverest thing to do with an aerorig is not rig an aerorig. Has anyone tried a cambered junkrig on any of Matt's boats? The cambers erasing the to windward deficits of the old school flat junksail.

To fit a Bermudan rig you'd need to add shrouds and stay(s), unless you did something clever with an aerorig (which you can Google).

To add leeboards you don't necessarily need to remove the chine runners:  just add battens for the boards to bear against clear of the runners.
