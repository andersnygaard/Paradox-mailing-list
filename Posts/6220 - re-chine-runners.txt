jhargrove - you are wright as usual;-)

I had forgotten to mention the larger rudder - which really gets upsized in Sven's new boat! I asked Sven about that, but he lost me in the explanation. But I do believe he plans on a small centerboard in the bow to assist upwind performance?

Bolger was the first I am aware of to try this (Small cb in the bow - large rudder area aft.) with his Dart Dinghy based on a dugout design from the Caribbean Islands and also the English Yorkshire coble. He expanded on the idea with his Cartopper design and also the Camper 640. These are all light displacement.
