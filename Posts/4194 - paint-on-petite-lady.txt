Subject: Paint on Petite Lady

Hi Glen, Jeff and all,

Petite Lady is glassed all over including cabin sides. I used a normal oil based undercoat all over, except the bottom, which is simply glassed and then coated with an epoxy copper dust mixture. My hull is painted with Interlux Brightside Yellow - I am impressed with this paint as it has stood up well and brushed on easily. The cabin sides are oil based standard white house paint, and the deck is British paints tinted to the colour I wanted. All the paint is in good condition and apart from a few chips could be used for quite a while yet without becoming scruffy.

Re my 40 nm trip, each year I sail to the Mahurangi Regatta, a total of 32 nm from my mooring, I generally take about 8 -9 hours to get there if the wind is steady, on one of my trips after the regatta, I sailed on to Kawau Island about a further 8 nm and after hanging around that area for a few days, I sailed around the island and sailed back to my mooring in one day, I think is was just over 40 nm and took me from memory about 12 hours. Most of my trips are uneventful, and thoroughly enjoyable. I try to pick my weather so there are no real dramas. I sail a lot over the tide around my local area - that generally gives me a six-hour sail. I generally have lunch on board - if the weather is light I just let the boat drift along and enjoy the peace and quiet. I am a lazy sailor and I enjoy the fact you can steer from inside when it rains or gets cold.

Sorry this is not terribly informative, but I'm afraid I never have any real dramas. It is a great little boat.

Regards, 
Hugh
