Hi

I have a pot bellied BBQ with a diameter of about 6" and a flue dia 
of 3" which would possibly do? 

The door is about 4 x 3" square, and I am sure a flue could easily be 
made up to fit, the legs bolt off as I remember so the height would 
be less than 12" just a thought. 

Any diy store woud have them for =A320 or as would ebay. 

Yours James

Ps, what are the main constituent elements of the paradox series design?
I have done ome thinking;- 
1) Inside sailing position, 
2) internal ballast,
3) simple lug rig, 
4) Chine runners,
5) heavy displacement (except enigma)

Possibly modifying one of the four cabin posts into something fatter,

somewhere a one inch diameter chimny for a little solid fuel bulkhead 
heater. Now which corner to choose?
