Subject: Re: scaled up Paradox

In the files section of the group there is a folder called LARGER PARADOX and it contains a word .doc file about how to scale it up.

http://groups.yahoo.com/group/paradoxbuilders/files/Larger%20Paradox/

I am interested in this topic as well and inquired about the scaling as much as 28 feet that was mentioned.

Glen-L boat plans says their designs can be stretched 10% without any noticeable effects and some cvan be enlarged as much as 20%.

If anyone has made a stretched version I would like to hear about the details too!

Regards,

Andrew

Subject: [paradoxbuilders] scaled up Paradox

I have heard and correct me if I am wrong....it has been said that Paradox can be scaled up by 20% without causing any performance issues.

I am curious if anyone out there has scaled one up?
