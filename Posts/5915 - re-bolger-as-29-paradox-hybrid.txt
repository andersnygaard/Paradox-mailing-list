Subject: Re: Bolger as-29 paradox hybrid

I believe that Matt first encountered this when sailing an small Bolger design that had the chine logs installed externally and felt they canceled out some of the leeway when the leeboard was removed. That design just had the leeboard clamped to hull and it could not be tilted back in shallow water so had to be all the way down or removed entirely. By "shortening" the logs and making them somewhat wider and more streamlined and parallel to the water flow - the chine runner was born.

And a boxy hull also acts as a keel according to Bolger - providing resistance to leeway, so the chine runners also function somewhat like end plates on a keel.

So this lead to Bolger's statement, "People don't realize that the looks they don't like in a square boat are responsible for the performance they do like."
