Subject: Water tanks

If enough water is carried to be a significant part of the ballast and the boat's stability, it will have to be replaced as it is used. One way to do this is to use smaller tanks or bottles, or gallon jugs of distilled water. Then as they are emptied they can be refilled with sea water etc. I would never, never, ever drink water stored in an epoxy tank. Tap water has a bad habit of going bad if stored for extended periods of time. Steam distilled water is totally germ and bacteria free. It keeps forever.
