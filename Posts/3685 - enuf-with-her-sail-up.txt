Subject: Enuf with her sail up
Date: Thu, 15 Jun 2006 13:52:11 -0000

Unfortunately still on her trolley but I ve posted three current views here:
http://ph.groups.yahoo.com/group/smallsailboats/photos/browse/ae11

that also show the current state of the hatch cover.
I'm thinking of dropping it further until it is just two inches high. Any comments appreciated.

Also, I had trouble furling the sail this morning. It was trying to move forward along the boom and ride over the furling drum. Didn't happen when I tried awhile back but I'm not sure 
there is anything different.

Thinking about it, the outboard end of the boom was lower, but why?
Any help appreciated here.

Note Fenry Honda ready for action :0)
