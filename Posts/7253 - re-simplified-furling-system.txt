I have a f/a topping lift, which makes reefing much easier under certain conditions. However I have to slacken it 
off when close hauled to prevent the aft line spoiling the shape of the sail. So in my case, when sailing reefed, 
the strut is helping to support the boom.

The tack fitting must hold the boom in place both vertically and horizontally (along the line of the boom). Tony 
seems to have found a simple solution to this but has, as you pointed out, made stowing the sail on deck more 
difficult. Not a problem for him on Miss Cindy, but it would be a bit of a nuisance on a Paradox. Though I am 
reminded that Bill, on Faith, used to leave his boom raised as his outboard got in the way of dropping it.

No doubt there are many other solutions which introduce their own compromises. To choose which is best for your 
situation you have to define what features are important to you.
