Subject: Re: epoxy resin

I used west system epoxy. I love this company and all they sell and advise. Plan to buy at least five gallons for the whole boat at least. I have heard nothing bad about Mas. Plan on using very many disposable paint brushes. From one inch to 3 or 4 inch wide. And rollers when doing the fiberglass coatings. You can save some of your sawdust to mix up epoxy putty where needed, to save a little money. Get into the habit of using surgical rubber gloves. I bought a box of one hundred for 7 or 8 bucks. It save lots of time in just cleaning your hands. I used two and a half boxes of these gloves. Steve Yahn
