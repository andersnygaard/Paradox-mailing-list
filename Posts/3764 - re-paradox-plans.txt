Subject: Re: Paradox Plans

Gary and Chuck were never really that far off-shore or in any kind of big seas and bad weather. Not that they may have been too worried as Frolic2 is a great design. Probably one of the most comfortable ones too!

Both Jim Michalak and Phil Bolger tend to be very conservative in suggesting their designs are off-shore capable. Perhaps for liability reasons? Even though a lot of their small boats are capable of self-righting from a 90% or more knock down, and unsinkable unless holed and/or caught out with the hatches open. 

Also both realize that the ability of the captain is just as important as the ability of the boat, if not more so.

Jim freely admits he would never go to sea in a Paradox either, but then he is not the off-shore sailor that Matt has demonstrated himself to be. Each individual has to make that decision for themselves based on an honest evaluation of their personal capabilities and not a macho fantasy. (Or making a mint on a best-seller:-)
And take it one step at a time. Matt has sailed/rowed/sculled/paddled over 25,000 miles in tiny boats. And even wintered over in the ice and snow in one.
However, he is reluctant to publish plans for liability reasons.
