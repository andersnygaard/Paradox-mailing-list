Al, 
The old chine runners on Whisper were real bad, the width, location, shape were off. They were so narrow, I just used them as a gluing base for the new ones. I believe Matt told me the angle (shape) was not that important as long as you had the area. I think.....Its been over a year scince I talked to him. Hope this helped

In what way were they wrong? should I have made mine more
accurately? I seem to remember just waving an angle grinder at
them till they looked about right. :-)

Hoping for calm nights
