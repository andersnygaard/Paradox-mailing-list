Subject: Re: Appraisal of a Paradox Sailboat

I went through those thoughts on sail position a while back, and came up with this: If the sail were further from the edge of the cabin then the tack strut (which is necessary to support the boom when reefed) would need to be longer to allow the sail to stow. If the strut were longer then the boom would be higher so a taller mast (which wouldn't stow inside) would be needed, or a smaller sail.

Once the boat is ballasted correctly tacking (or failing to tack) isn't a big issue.

Don't I keep reading that small cats often need a couple of strokes with a paddle to get them to tack?

When beating I usually head up till the luff is just lifting. My new gps tells me that I travel faster on the port tack (with the sail against the mast), though which tack is closest to the wind is more difficult to tell.

Hoping for calm nights
