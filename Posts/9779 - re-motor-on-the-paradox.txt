Very clever design, Eerik.

Your solution would keep the weight down while mitigating against any sheets becoming ensnared by the motor. Sounds like Chris C may have done the same with his dox. Nick relocated the block on his dox as an alternative solution.

After reading your response, I checked the Torqeedo site to learn more about the ultralight. It does appear that you could use their product without the mounting part to secure it to your dox as you have done with the trolling motor. If the Torqeedo solution offers more power. I have attached the picture herein so that one can see that the shaft and motor propellor part is the main point of interest. Another advantage is to place the battery inside the dox of a location of one's choice.

I am very attracted to the idea of low weight and keeping the main sheet lines free from entanglement with this possible solution.

When you going to upgrade Eerik? Now we are looking for you to test out and post results. ;-)
