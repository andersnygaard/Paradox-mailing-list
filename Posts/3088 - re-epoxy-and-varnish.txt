Hi Derek,

Not at all, but im critical of yours :) you mention knots, hope there small :) stay away from any encased knots, thats the type that has what looks like bark grown around it, small spike knots are acceptable if not too many in one spot there is alot of stresses on the sail rig under sail.. the leather was stolen from a "80's" style jacket lol nice leather it was black and matched my colors. I also use a piece of black rubber roofing around the base of the mast, you can get this from any commercial roofing company, just ask them for some rubber roof scraps, I may sew a leather one but I think the rubber will outlast it.
