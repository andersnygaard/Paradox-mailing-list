Subject: Re: Small Sailboats web site

The Small Sailboats web site can again be accessed using the domain name: http://www.smallsailboats.co.uk but the old address, http://www.btinternet.com/~w.serjeant, is no longer available.

There may be a few links needing attention, but the bulk of the site is functioning correctly.

Please let me know how the site can be improved and give me any new site addresses you think should be added.

Thanks,
Bill.
