Thank you Al. I like the idea of a disk or washer. I'm in the process of studying the plans. Another thing. The mainsheet is presented to the helmsman at his back, and this seems awkward. I had visualized running it forward a bit say two or three feet,along the starboard side near the tiller rope. And then round a block and running aft a bit and then to it's cleat or camcleat. As this way it would be in the front of the helmsman. Is it annoying at all where it is, as shown on the plans ?
Thank you again,
