Hi Paul,

Yes I understand what you mean and after the coffee wore off I became 
more stable in my thinking. Now I realize that the interior size 
could be better enlarged by adding the length to the centre!;-)) This 
should actually improve performance. Little cruiser is just the 
ticked bu there are no plans available to me knowledge. And Mat's 
newest designs are actually bigger than I need.

I have the same needs as you regarding colder weather, although my 
cruising is planned for British Columbia. So I agree with you on the 
hatch configuration, (I hate wet bedding) lots of insulation and no 
built-in water tanks.

I have never ventured to the Quebec side of James Bay but I have 
travelled all along the western coast, from Fort Churchill up through 
Chesterfield Inlet and past Repulse Bay. (All these settlements now 
have Inukitut names.) And the ones in Quebec all have French and Inuk 
names. I did all my traveling by plane however. I used to service the 
weather equipement and train radio operaters at the small airports in 
those areas.

I hope you really understand what it is like up in that area before 
you go. James Bay may not be too bad, but Hudson Bay is incredibly 
dangerous, due to extremely shallow rocky shorelines and significant 
tides. For example you can be 10 to 20 miles out from the shoreline 
and still not have enough water to float a canoe. And then you have 
the wind... In fact it is difficult to locate the shoreline in many 
areas as the whole topography is either ice or water it seems.
