Subject: Re: Sleep two in a Paradox?

The as-designed Paradox has a flat floor 1.9m by 0.94m tapering to 
0.78m (with a lump out of the narrow end for the mast step).

If storage in the side bins is sacrificed then at least another 100mm 
can be gained (if flotation is removed then 200mm).

Hoping for calm nights
