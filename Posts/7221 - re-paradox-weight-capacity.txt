Not sure what you mean here.

The displacement in sailing trim (with the skipper on board) is 640kg (1410lb). With little equipment on board 180kg of this will be lead ballast and 70kg water ballast. So, in theory, you could carry 180 kg of stores, anchors, bicycles, batteries etc.

In practice I have trimmed my boat for myself and then, on occasion, carried 2 other people without noticing any significant change in sailing performance. Mind you, we didn't sail far as it was a bit crowded in there.

Thanks for your response. I was wondering about the occupant weight capacity of the boat.
