Hi,

Don't wish to be a doomsayer, but-
Unfortunately the numbers do not add up when looking at
electric power as your only system.
Solar panels wont be adequate for replenishing batteries
if these are to be used for propulsion and cooking, and
a wind generator would need to have blades of 6' and upwards
in order to get any useful amount of power-impossible on a tiny
Paradox-size boat.
You could get upto 100watts from a pedal-powered generator...
or a water-powered one if sailing with plenty of wind might
be useful without slowing you down too much. Some of these are
designed to be towed behind the boat, so no complicated transom 
mounting required.
If the micro-wave mentioned is only about 50% efficient, I'd expect
a simple immersion heating element could be more efficient if used
in a very well insulated container to reduce heat losses. A resistive 
(immersion heater) element is 100% efficient-all the power it uses 
ends up as heat- so if you manage to not lose any of that, I think it 
would be a better bet. Perhaps make up something using a thermos as 
the heated vessel?
Having said all this, an electric cooker of some sort could be good 
to have as a VERY occasional thing if conditions were so bad that the 
gimballed gas stove was not safe to use.

Cheers,
Alan.
