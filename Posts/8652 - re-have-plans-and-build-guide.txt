Wanda and David came through within 24hrs of ordering the assembly
manual (written by her late husband Don) and the Paradox plans were
delivered via email as a PDF files. I have been obsessed with this
project and want to get started mid-summer after I get my Com-Pac 23
back in shape and in the waters of Lake Erie. I am planning to add
tools required to make this project as accurate as possible. In Don's
manual he states that a table saw is nearly a necessity. Would a table
saw have a significant advantage over a quality jigsaw? Any more info
on tools (I have the basics) that would be recommended?

I bought a table saw when I read that in Don's manual. It is possible 
that I used it twice.

However, If you intend to cut the cleats yourself, from rough sawn, 
then it could be very useful.

I understand that Matt built the original Paradox in a wood where 
there was no power, so obviously no power tools are *necessary* but I 
wore out my cheap jigsaw.

If you already have a selection of tools I would hold off buying any 
new ones (unless you are looking for an excuse) until you find you 
need them. This, of course, excludes clamps. I managed with only 10 
(including two 6ft sash clamps) but felt the need for more.
