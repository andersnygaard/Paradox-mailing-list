2 gallon's of gas and an outboard motor plus the box. That's about 50 lbs beyond of the transom.
You must trim your boat to take this weight shift into account by moving the crew and ballast.
As PARADOX's cabin forward sole is level with the designed waterline, it would be easy trim the boat correctly using a cheap caravan leveller http://www.towsure.com/product.asp?p=3D895 or a loop of 1/4 - 3/8" clear fuel line using marks on the bins equal height from the sole.
The fuel line would be a closed loop joined with a short piece of copper tube. Colour the water with ink.
