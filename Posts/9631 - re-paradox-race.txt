William,

The group can have several owners. You and I are both owners, and I have now added Glen Maxwell too. I don't know if Glen is about at the moment. I'm never far from a computer, though.

I think prize money can wait. I believe you're legit, and anyway it's a thing well worth doing, prize money or not. Let's see how big a virtual fleet we can gather for next Feb. :-) Some kind of real time tracking might be fun but I don't expect most Paradox owners to have some sort of SPOT tracker or similar. I'll think some more about what we can do.
