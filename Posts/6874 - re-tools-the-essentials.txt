Subject: Re: Tools - the essentials

Smilicus,

Remember when I said I was shopping for a digital camera to start documenting my build?  Actually that was the excuse I used to buy another camera...sounds to me like you have an ideal excuse to load up on tools and other bits that facilitate the boat building addiction we all suffer from.

This is the nut-and-bolt/meat-and-potatoes list of what I have used to build my last three boats and what I'll use as well on ENDEAVOUR.

1. Table Saw- great for those long rips and essential for squaring up a sheet of ply. Make sure the electric motor is rated as heavy duty.

2. Drill Press- When you need several holes drilled in uniform fashion don't rely on the hand held.

3. Jig Saw- Not essential but really nice if the piece your working on has curves.

4. Circular Saw- 7 1/4 inch and again rated as heavy duty.

5. Belt Sander- Would not build with out one!

6. Detail Sander- Some call it a mouse sander, some call it a jitterbug sander either way worth its weight in gold.

7. Screw Gun (hand drill)- makes quick easy work out of fastening hulls sides to bulkheads, and for drilling pilot holes.

I bought all of these tools and everything else needed at a local Habor Freight Tools store.  If you have one close by or can get to one they will save you TONS of money that you can later spend when outfitting.  This is by no means a complete or even a correct list...it's just what I have used and as I said...ENDEAVOUR will be my fourth build.

Hope this get you going....
