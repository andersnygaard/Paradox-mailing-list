Hi Bill.

I will tint with the green Micron. That way I know that all is
compatible. I've mixed the red and black Trinidad to arrive at an
attractive (perhaps just different?) black cherry color. 

I do like the initial coat of bottom paint to be of a contrasting
color to highlight when scrubbing and scraping have gone through the
top coat. This results in a few colors with which to experiment. Some
folks get creative and paint eyes on the bows, under the waterline. I
presume this is to ward off whales or submarines. I've seen playful
messages painted on bottoms of race boats, and even the name and hail
for that 45 degree mode of identification.
