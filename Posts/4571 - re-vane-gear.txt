Glen, I am reliably informed that at 120 sq. feet of sail and 1100 lbs
maximum displacement (SA/D ratio of 18) I will require a hurricane to
hit 5 knots.  I guess there's hope, though, because in daysailing trim
(800 lbs and a ratio of 22) I may only require a tropical storm.  I
attempted to argue this with numbers, pointing out that a fully loaded
Paradox has a ratio of 12.8, but to no avail.

All kidding aside, that's another beautiful job of engineering. 
You're good at this.
