Hey Andy....

I think that would work...although you may still need some sort of rubstrake on the corner of the deck/transom union to prevent chafe.  I'd say go for it! :-) It will look much cleaner than Scout's line which exits at the designed exit point, then travels up the exterior of the transom to the fairlead.
