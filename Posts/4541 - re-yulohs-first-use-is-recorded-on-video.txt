Hi Bill.

FAITH is looking good and the more you use her the easier it will get.
It's funny that the day I said I was going to start to finish the glass fibre covering. The deck, transom and sides, was the day it started to rain, and it has been raining ever since, but the few days it did not there was always someone wanting to get me to give them a hand.
I have lost five weeks now since the rains started. But I have been cleaning and filling the cabin inside and making another hatch as I am making the opening a bit larger.
My 16 foot rowing skiff is painted yellow with a shade called Mayonnaise with a light grey stripe under the rub rail. I was going to paint NOLI the same colour all over but I see you have gone for the same shade more or less.
I hope you won't be offended if I do. There is a photo of my skiff in my NOLI folder of this forum.

Hope the weather comes fine for you and Al soon then we might get to see some video's of both your PARADOX's sailing.
