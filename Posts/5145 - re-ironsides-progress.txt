I'll echo that too and add my vote of thanks.
Al's site has helped greatly in understanding the construction 
techniques.
I'd also like to thank all the others on the board who have posted 
photo's and info of their build. Every little bit helps it all fall 
into place.

I can't go without thanking Glen, whose inspirational article on Zoe's 
sea trials,
http://home.alltel.net/ifida/home.alltel.net_000001.htm
was probably what actually convinced me to buy-into this project!

Al and Bill's trip reports keeps, for me, the dream alive.
I've also probaly stolen a few ideas from both Bill and Glen. I hope 
there is no copywright!

Thankyou.

Pete
