Hi All, John

Just be very careful. Heat diffusers can be carbon monoxide generators and even with Paradox's excellent ventilation you don't need too much to have serious health problems. The worst thing about them is they are not immediately obvious, just slowly feeling lethargic, achey, often taken to be a flu coming on.

Enjoy
