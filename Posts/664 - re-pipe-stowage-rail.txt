Page 12 of the Paradox plans has the yuloh diagram.  A yuloh is an excellent way to propel a micro-cruiser when there is no wind.  Below are some links to sites on how to build and use this amazing oar. Construction and use:  http://members.tripod.com/simplicityboats/yulohpage.html. How to scull: http://www.geocities.com/Yosemite/Geyser/6383/yuloh2.htm
