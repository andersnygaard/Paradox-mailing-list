You may be onto something here. 
I had a Reliant for a weekend. As I went round corners it felt like it was going to tip over. 
Luckily, I got a swap for a BSA A7 which I swapped for a Norton. That was much better.
I wonder if God preprogrammed us to take a certain route to get to here? Worries me a little.
