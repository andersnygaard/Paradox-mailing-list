Subject: Re: Engine for the Paradox

I like much of the Paradox, but quite know why. It is much more beautiful and for other reasons. Scram the practical, but aesthetics stood aside. But if we look at the practical aspects, it is possible to find justification for opting for this project. The fact is that there is no ideal boat, just search the best relationship qualities.
