Yes, he's not been motivated to do so, for personal reasons.

At this point I will have to stick to my own concept: A 'sea plane' that is actually just a boat. Not sure yet if it will rest on pontoons or actually float in the water like a Piaggio P.7.

My favorite part of the build is that it will piss off every hardened boat builder who only lives to disparage anything new.

Bummer! Hopefully it will get good use. I don't think there are plans out there for any of Matt's other designes.

The paradox was sold over a week ago.

I am hunting for an Elusion or a Enigma.... the lighter the better. I'd be willing to pay for someone to do much of the work.

Is the paradox still for sale? I'm interested. At the very least I'd want to come take a look. I've been playing around with the idea of building for a while now. Even bought plans and building guide. But this may be a better option.
