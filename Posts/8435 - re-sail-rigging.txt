Hi William,

If I were building a Paradox, I'd avoid cutting a slot in the upper part of
the mast for the halyard pulley sheave. Mine has never broken - yet - but it
looks like a weakness to my eyes which could have been avoided.

I'd just glue on a little wood chock on the starboard side of the mast about
an inch and a half below the mast top and suspend a block from a short rope
strop just resting around the mast top. The little chock stops it from
sliding down.

You could do the same for the topping lift on the other side of your mast top, although there's less stress on the topping lift than the halyard and some just have little fairlead instead of the pulley block.

One issue that you may not have considered is the halyard sheave needs to be as near to the top of the mast as you can possibly get it, or else there isn't enough height for you to get the sail fully up.

Best,

Jim
