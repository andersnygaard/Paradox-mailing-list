I'm not really offended but I just think that the paradox isn't for everyone.  I built a robbsboat and already sold it.  Right now I'm working on a cross between a brick and a paradox.  www.microcruiser.net  I have also just re-acquired my enigma clone, Explorer, which was bought from me on my first trip out on the water.  The guy that bought it passed away.

Actually, I think I'd rather have the Robbsboat, it will certainly out-point the paradox .  That is my  only complaint with boats that use chine runners, they just can't do what a good daggerboard will do.  Don't get me wrong, I love the paradox.  Robb

You are right to say that you could add all the niceties to the Robbsboat, but if you were going to do that, you might as well build a Paradox.

I'm a bit biased here.  I have often thought of building a Robbsboat, but have not.  I'd like to see one get built, even of it is done by someone other than myself.

On the same note, I admire ANYONE who had the determination to build ANYTHING.  My own boat project is now 2.5 years old and I'm just now starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel.    I have a bit more glassing inside the hull, and then paint.  The spars, mast, rudder, and leeboard are done.  Only the junk sail is then left to build!   Last week I dug out my old sewing machine to start that process rolling.
