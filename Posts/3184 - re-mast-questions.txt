Subject: Re: Mast Questions

At the top I brought the flex out just below the wooden plug. At the bottom I fitted a socket as low as I could so that I could reach it from inside. Because of the taper at the bottom of the mast the socket clears the hole in the deck (be careful not to knock it off when inserting/removing the mast). I didn't want to put a hole in the mast near the deck as that is where the maximum bending moment is.

Inside the mast I spaced out 2" lengths of pipe insulation to prevent the wire slapping.

On the subject of names I am not the best adviser ("Little Jim" only arrived after 18 months). But definitely not Yoyo, it gives an entirely untrue impression.
