Subject: Re: Paradox history and capabilities (Oldshoe)

Bolger designed a smaller version of Micro called Oldshoe as in - comfortable as - an open design and later on talked about adding a slot-top doghouse to it, to enclose the sleeping area. (Optionally removable.) Unfortunately he passed away before it reached fruition. Interesting build site here, with lots of links.
