Subject: Lightning rod system

Can any of the Paradox owners with the lightning dissipation system, as designed by Matt, provide any firsthand accounts of how the system worked in an actual lightning strike?  I'm guessing there's a good chance that Matt and/or Dave/Mindy have sustained a hit or two considering the amount of time they have spent aboard in Florida and the Bahamas.

My question is not born of simple idle curiosity.  I'm working on my mast and having debates with myself about whether or not to install the lightning system.  I wonder if putting the charge down a hollow wooden mast is asking for an explosion of splinters in the event of a strike.  Also, I wonder about routing the charge down through the inside of the boat.  I realize that most sailboats with a stayed mast use the standing rigging to channel the charges and route the charges overboard, thus minimizing the chance for it to get inside the vessel.

I'm not trying to second guess Matt's plans.  The more I study them, the more I appreciate their practicality, and the greater my hesitancy to make significant changes or deviations.  However, if someone has some firsthand, or even secondhand, evidence of how the lightning system has worked in an actual strike, I would appreciate hearing about it. Maybe I can then quit the internal debating.

Sorry to be so long winded.
