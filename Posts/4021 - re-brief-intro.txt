Welcome aboard.

Last week I went out on Chew Valley lake with someone from Bath who is thinking of building. He has been sailing dinghies for 40 years and said he had not believed about the hands-off sailing till he was actually doing it. He also didn't believe, until he saw it, that I could launch it, park the trailer and get aboard without getting my feet (or the trailer wheels) wet (the slipway has no pontoon).

Pop down sometime and see what it is all about. 

Thanks for all the info Al. I'll take you up on your offer sometime. I'd love to see how your trailer works so that you don't have to submerge the wheels.

I won't be rushing into things (I've not got much time on my hands until next September) but might be able to make a slow start in the new year. I'm already planning my shake down cruise to the Scilly Isles!
