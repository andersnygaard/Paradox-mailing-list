Subject: Paradox Ballast/Runners

I have followed with interest the comments on Paradox ballast and the chine runners. I too have thought of these as an add-on to other designs such as the Featherwind of Carnell $200 sailboat. I went round round with the lead ballast idea with my West Wight Potters, and as an old bullet caster have no problems with the process....BUT I want my ballast to either do some work or be able to drain on the ramp so I don't have to tow it home.  Toward the first option, two or four golf cart batteries centrally located would add some options for propulsion or convenience.  The interesting option of casting the chine runners might overlook what complicated shapes they tend to be.  I wonder if the runners couldn't be patterned with offsets like you would see for a "warped canoe", where they are cut out and then tack and tape assembled from 1/8' doorskins (or cardboard first) for adding to other craft. The hard chines of the above mentioned Potters and the hull shape of my Hobie 16 which caries a LOT of sail with NO centerboard keep the what-if wheels churning for applying the Paradox runners to other desiigns. Keep those ideas flowing! - and for those of you who have them, I would still like to see more pics of the chine runners on the boat. Best regards, JImG
