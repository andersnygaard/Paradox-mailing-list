Subject: Re: Is Paradox suitable for the "vertically challenged"? ;o)

I am tall too, and wanted something in a large micro cruiser and thaought maybe a stretched paradox would work for me. After all there is a doc. about Matt Layden's blessing for a stretched ver in the files section.

Someone in here suggested to me to consider the "Swaggie" a design by John Welsford http://www.jwboatdesigns.co.nz/projects/swaggie/index.htm and I must say I am impressed with what he packs into it. Yes you can sail it completely enclosed like the Paradox. 

The drawing reminds me of Don Elliott's work. I found construction logs by people and also Swaggie in YouTube.

He has also designed a 21footer which he calls Sundowner class and named Resolution looks fantastic. Check "sundowner Diaries" on his home page or gpo to this link here http://www.jwboatdesigns.co.nz/plans/sundowner/updates.htm

o.k. I've been intrigued with Paradox for awhile now.... my problem is that I'm 6'4.5" tall and need sitting headroom of 39 inches (not counting a cushion for my aging butt). Sooo, shall I begin looking at other designs? Or could I realisticly fit... What are realistic dimensions for a paradox sailer?

Thanks and all the best to you folks,
