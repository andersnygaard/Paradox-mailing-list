Subject: Re: Paradox Plans

I think its more Monroe's sharpie that is the inspiration for the paradox.

I am building a stitch and glue sharpie with chine runners, inspired
by Matt's designs.  I had some ideas that I wanted to try out and
decided to design a boat on my own.  If you want a boat quickly and
with assurance that it will work well, follow the plans.  If you have
done some boat design and built a few boats, it might be fun to design
your own.
