Hi all,

It will take me three posts to explain the waterproof hatch cover for Gorfnik. The hatch cover is made of two parts which are hinged in the middle. This hinged hatch is removable and in good weather is tied on the front deck with fastex buckles on two straps, where it serves as a table for cooking from a standing position inside. To use the hinged hatch, the bottom half (with the top half attached by the hinge) simply slides on and off the front half of the cabin top.

In a previous post, I had explained that the cabin top had an extra 1/2 inch of height all around the rear half. The reason for this was to fully support a 1 inch by 1 inch aluminium angle all along the back half, whereas the front half is only supported on the vertical edge which permits inserting the bottom part of the folding hatch cover, hinged end first.

Before installing the side windows, I pre-drilled all the screw holes in their sides and bottom, but not at the top. At the top, I first pre-drilled the aluminium angle, and then used it as a template to drill the remaining screw holes. After a dry fit and liberal use of masking tape, I spread silicone with a notched trowel and screwed down the window as quickly as possible, every second screw first, then the ones in between.

You will note from the pictures that I routered a 1/4 inch wide by 1/4 inch deep «gutter» in the front half of the cabin top. At the end of the gutter (in the middle of the boat), there is a 1/4 inch hole which permits the gutter to drain through to the outside of the window. The gutter only serves as a backup in case a bit of water finds it's way around the hatch cover. More later.
