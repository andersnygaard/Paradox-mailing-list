Could shortcomings due to his sail cause some of his initial problems?  If the sail is really badly cut it could cause a lot more leeway and lack drive to windward. 

 I've recently bought a new sail for my Paradox and it's transformed the boat. It was previously very slow to tack and uncertain to go from port to starboard tack. Also could hardly make any progress to windward at all on port tack. Pretty well dead in the water then.
So I had to make liberal use of the engine if my destination was upwind.
The old sail was the first one that was used on ZOE BTW.

Now with my new sail all is sweetness and light. Much improved performance and I'm in love with the boat again. Well worth investing in a good well shaped sail as a bad one will kill the boat and disappoint.

Best

Jim
