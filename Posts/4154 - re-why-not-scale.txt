Before having all the trouble of ingreasing a Paradox,
why not to go to:
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/BolgerCartoons/files/
and look for Fiji Yawl. This boat look like a verry big
Paradox with living place for all the family...Roger

group for a few months, and it seems 
that there has been a fair bit of discussion on modifiying the 
Paradox design to increase the size. The designer, Matt, apparently 
has approved a modest increase in scale.

Some companies and boat designers who make a living designing boats 
often have similar designs in different sizes to meet different 
needs. Matt actually considered a couple of different versions of a 
bit larger Paradox (21' &amp; 23')and provides concept sketches in his 
disk that comes with his plans. It looks like a lot of thought went 
into these sketches, as was done for the original Paradox.

Perhaps if he was given enough incentive Matt might take some time 
from what he is doing to convert the concepts into a plan. 
Incentive? 
-- someone offering to pay for a design and someone actually 
building 
a prototype. It looks like this has been a practice with designs of 
Phil Bolger , John Welsford and Jim Michalak.

Maybe someone on this list could contact Matt to see if he would be 
interested and what the incentive might be, then poll the members to 
see how many would be interested sharing the costs of getting new 
plans made. There is a provision on this site to conduct a poll....
