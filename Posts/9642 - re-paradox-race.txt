Hi,

I understand a different time will be needed to have a large race where everyone can participate. I want everyone to race at the same time. If we figure this out all other versions will be easier. If it is going to be unfair to some people then maybe this can be done not in one single day but 2 or 3 separate days in different times of the year. You guys decide the rules. I only ask that I feel like I have a chance in my stock paradox in my local lake here in Texas.
