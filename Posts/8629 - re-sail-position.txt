Sure you can put a lug sail on the other side, just have to re-rig the thing. You have asymmetric performance already with a lug sail. I haven't sailed on in many years but my guess is better performance when the mast is windward. As normally positioned this means starboard tack which would be the preferred long tack for rights. 

Or are you speaking of moving the sail to leeward of the mast on each tack? Maybe workable in light winds.
