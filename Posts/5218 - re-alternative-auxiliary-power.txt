My brother scored a hole in one just a couple of weeks ago. It was on a 160 yard par 3 and he said he used a "hybrid 5 iron."

That is the first I heard they are now going green with golf clubs as well:-)

Golf cart batteries are quite commonly being used in boats nowadays and even some consideration to using the motors on the top of an old gas outboard leg.
