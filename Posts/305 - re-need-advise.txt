David from what I remember she is well worth fixing up. What I didn't do was a rot check. Take an ice pick and probe around the entire boat. What you are looking for is the presence of soft wood. if there is any the ice pick will go in like your pushing it into a dry sponge, no force needed. No need to try to break the surface if you find rot you will know it. especially check all the corners. Again let me emphasize, don't go poking holes all thru your boat with the ice pick just gentle probing, if there is rot there the pick will slide right in. Just do the inside as the out side is covered in glass. Do that and we will go from there. Don't despair if you find a little, it can be repaired. Do a good check and get back to me with the results OK?
