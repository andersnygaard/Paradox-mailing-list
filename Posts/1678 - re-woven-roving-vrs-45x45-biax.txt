Hi Jack.

Abrasion resistance. The stressed 18mm plywood bottom is hella strong on it's own right. I think that this laminating schedule is based more on economy. If I had biax laying around, I wouldn't hesitate to use it, though I would probably shoot for a total of 4mm. I'm sure you can get by fine with less. Mat is not suitable for use with epoxy.
