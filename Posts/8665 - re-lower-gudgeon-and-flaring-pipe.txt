Subject: Re: Lower Gudgeon and Flaring Pipe

Hi Jim,

Thanks for the reply. I've gone without sleeving in the lower gudgeon. I guess I could always add it later if I noticed wear occurring. It seems that as long as you align things correctly there's no need for sleeving for the halyard and maybe not the sheeting off holes in the mast vent box either where the clam cleats are located.

So that leaves the furling line hole and the sheet entry point in the transom as the only places where flared sleeving is required.

I'm going down the water ballast path because I used soft drink bottles filled with water under the seats in my last boat and they were a real hassle. All the filling, emptying, placement and removal was a drag. I'm looking forward to simply placing a hose on the deck for a few minutes and I'm sorted. Granted, emptying them won't be quite so easy. I'm planning on using a plumber's siphon to empty my tanks (a plumber's siphon is one of those rubber squeezy bulbs with a one way valve in it) once the boat is on the trailer. It would also enable me to use the water from the tanks if I need to for washing etc. I think I will stick with soft drink bottles for my drinking water though.

I'm looking forward to winter! We've had an unusual summer too with lots of high humidity days.

Cheers,

Rob.
