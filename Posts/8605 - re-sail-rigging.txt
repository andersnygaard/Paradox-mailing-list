Being a little older has many disadvantages. I not having the balance and strength as I once had I am having trouble installing and removing my mast safely. I am thinking about modifying my mast to allow it to hinge and rest on the cabin top. I could use the trailer winch to help raise and lower it. Any commits or sugestions?
