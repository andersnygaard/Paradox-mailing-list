After all my searching after suitable household paints I was in my cellar the other day and found two cans of International dark green that I don't remember buying. Paint problem solved.

What are the advantages of using fairing compound in the sheathing of the boat? Does it do anymore than make it look 'nice'? I don't want to spend hours sanding and smoothing to get a gin palace look on a 4 metre boat that I hope will have a hard life. I won't be using anti fouling because I intend to use the sea just to get to rivers and other freshwater where most marine growth will fall off anyway, and the decks will have silver sand in the last layer of paint for cheap non slip. I am thinking of not putting any paint below the water line at all.
Do I really lose anything if I just paint over the epoxy and glassfibre on the sides of Enuf?

Thanks for any help .... Derek
