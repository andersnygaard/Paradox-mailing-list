I would just flush them through with Milton or  other bleach of your 
choice.
I'd imagine that the water would stay fairly fresh because there is 
no breather and therefore no air enters the tanks as they are drained.
Why Wine and beer boxes stay fresh(er) unlike opened bottles.
I'd make a screw down plate  big enough to remove the bag for 
cleaning as required.

Oh well there's always next time. Chichester harbour is pretty 
shallow isn't it? I thought a lot of it dried out at half tide.

I'm trying to decide where my Maiden voyage will be. At the moment 
I'm considering Milford Haven for a shake down (although its not 
likely to be until 2009!)
