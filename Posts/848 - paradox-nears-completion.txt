Hi,

I have added a few more pictures to my photo record of the building of my Paradox cruiser Little Jim. You can find it at: www.asjg.clara.co.uk/little_jim/little_jim.htm

I have reached a major landmark as all the actual making is complete. The next job is the paint, and then fit all the bits and pieces.

I have been assessing the building process, and have come up with the following statistics.

I ordered the plans in April 2001 and started buying tools and materials 2 months later. I have been working steadily the whole time, with some work done nearly every week, however I haven't been rushing it.

So far the boat has cost 2751.16ukp and don't expect to have to spend any more before we are afloat. This includes most of the power tools used in the construction and other tools such as clamps etc.

The above does not include the trailer. I wanted the launch/recovery to be simple for single handed operation without getting the trailer wet. I also wanted to be able to launch/recover onto a flat surface (beach with the tide out). I also have quite severe width limits if I am to store it at home. All this ended up with me getting a trailer custom built to my own design (so it's all my fault if it doesn't work) with the consequent extra cost. It ended up at 1502.12ukp :-( and will be delivered in 4 weeks. By then everything else should also be ready.

I am hoping to have a grand launching over Easter, but 2 of my relatives are getting married this year (not to each other) and my 2 children have major exams so I may be over ruled.

However I shall keep you informed.

By the way, has anyone heard how Matt is getting on in the Everglades Challenge?

Hoping for calm nights
