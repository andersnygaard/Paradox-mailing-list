Yes, that's another cool idea too. Many different ways to go. Which one you chose will have a lot to do with where and what conditions you sail in.

Bottom line is at the moment it is very tough to beat a small 2 or 3hp, 4 stroke motor and a tank of gas. It's not as sexy as the alternatives but it is probably the most cost effective and efficient way to go.

A solar panel on your battery to keep your GPS and handheld radio alive will take care of the rest.
