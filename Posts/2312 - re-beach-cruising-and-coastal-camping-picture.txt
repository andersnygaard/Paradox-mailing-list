Hi Dave

I was hoping that someone else would ask this but as it hasn't happened here goes. 
Now that you are the owner of Swamp Thing is there any chance of detailed photographs, 
inside and outside, and/or plans? Even enough detail to allow an attempt to copy her ?
Best wishes...........Derek

ps My own Paradox bujilding has taken a step backwards because I couldn't get the stem 
to fit in the trial assembly. Also, I bevelled a lump off my finger while making a wooden 
spoon on a belt sander (got side tracked by Tudors). I'm giving it a weeks rest and will 
start agian with renewed enthusiasm on Thursday!

pps I'm finding that epoxy fumes make me retch. Any body got any advise on a good, UK 
available , mask. The ordinary pad type don't help.
