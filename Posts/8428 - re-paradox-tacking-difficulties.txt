Ha
Two nations divided by a common language, eh?  

Dave described his device very nicely and we all know exactly what  me means.

Sorry to disagree John but in the US the tackle to pull down
the boom is often called a boom vang or vang for short. =C2=A0
Terms vary a bit from place to place.

=C2=A0Dave,

Thanks for your interesting
comparison between Matt's different designs, and for
posting your clever vang attachment method.

I'm still curious how Little
Cruiser's bow centerboard affected her sailing
characteristics, as I've never sailed with a bow
centerboard? Do you think a bow centerboard makes tacking
more difficult than a more centrally-located centerboard
would? When reaching do you have an increased weather helm?
And when sailing downwind do you lift the bow centerboard to
reduce the change of broaching?

John

I've
sailed four of Matt Layden's boats which includes
Paradox, Little Cruiser, Enigma 360 and Swamp Thing. I
honestly can't say one is necessarily better then the
other=C2=A0since each=C2=A0is a bit different.=C2=A0=C2=A0I'll start off
by noting that Paradox is the most seaworthy of all of
these designs. If I was going to be caught in an especially
awful storm offshore that's the boat I would want to be
in.=C2=A0 Next in terms of survivability would be LC,
then=C2=A0Enigma and finally Swamp Thing.=C2=A0

As for their
ability to tack quickly, Paradox is the slowest; next comes
LC and finally=C2=A0Enigma and Swamp Thing are the quickest.=C2=A0
If staying on a=C2=A0course without touching the helm is what
you need then Paradox wins hands down. Enigma and=C2=A0Swamp
Thing=C2=A0are pretty good too but=C2=A0 LC needs a lot=C2=A0more
constant attention. Matt suggested improving LC with chine
runners, and you would then have the best of both worlds.
Chris Morejohn did just that with his two Hogfish designs
(the newest has a dagger board), and he has been happy. But
with a microcruiser, interior space is at a premium, and it
may not be worth it so I'm sticking with the chine
runners only for now.As for windward performance=C2=A0I
would have to say that=C2=A0Enigma might=C2=A0be the best amongst
the lot, which is probably due to her lower overall
deck=C2=A0profile and an especially well made sail. Of course
this is just my feeling. Matt probably would
disagree.=C2=A0Nonetheless, I just love sailing that little boat
to weather.=C2=A0

Now for sailing down wind
I've found that roller furling=C2=A0sails without a boom
vang like you have on Paradox, Enigma and Swamp Thing are
harder to manage, especially=C2=A0in heavy winds. Under these
more severe conditions, I've noticed the boom tends to
lift=C2=A0up in=C2=A0gusts which causes the boat to=C2=A0roll
excessively. This never happens on LC because her=C2=A0balanced
lug sail=C2=A0has a=C2=A0 vang. However there is no way to attach a
permanent vang to=C2=A0Matt's roller furling boom design at
present. Therefore, on my trip to the Bahamas aboard E
nigma, I added=C2=A0a temporary vang=C2=A0whenever it was blowing
hard downwind.=C2=A0

For those interested, this vang
consisted of a=C2=A0short piece of PVC tube which=C2=A0was split and
slipped over the end of the boom and sail. A=C2=A0line was then
tied=C2=A0to the tube and attach to the deck.=C2=A0I found that this
remedy worked pretty well and reduced the rolling
significantly.=C2=A0

Finally in terms of comfort,
Paradox and LC are the best.=C2=A0Their cabins are more
comfortable year round due to the insulation,=C2=A0and they have
ample space and storage for almost everything you will
need.=C2=A0=C2=A0Enigma and Swamp Thing are definitely more cramped
as you would expect, but I do enjoy sailing them closer to
shore with their=C2=A06-7 inch draft.
