I am surprised that no one has commented on the mast placement on Sven's new design and also the daggerboard placement in relation to the mast.

Of course the rudder is also acting as a lateral plane.

So you have lateral plane at bow and stern and the mast much further aft than usual. Also no backstay visible to keep the headstay taut.

Seems weird. But somehow I suspect it works!

Also that daggerboard seems awfully vulnerable. What happens if you hit something just under the water with it down?
