Yoh Admiral Clark,

Be prepared for your papers assigning you to the Persian Gulf.

Beggar that for a game of soldiers; I did my time when I was young and silly. Anyway, 
when Enuf is finished she'll be better equipped than many RN ships. Except for the crew of 
course:0)

Another alternative would be to paint it in Spitfire colours, just in case a Zero appears.

Makes you wonder if Zero has any Mitsubishi electronics aboard

(Notice I even spelled "colours" correctly in the Queens English:-)

It's nice of you to spell colour correctly Nels but I'm not conviced that Her Maj knows how 
to spell (maybe why we have a superfluous u in colour and no x in socks). Lot of german 
blood in her and she probably has a little man to do spellings for her anyway.

Sun's well over the yardarm and I fancy a drinkypoo, or two so I'll toddle orf to the 
wardroom now.
Adm C.
ps Sail arrived today. It's big and very red!
