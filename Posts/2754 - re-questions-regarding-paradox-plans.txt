Subject: Re: Questions regarding Paradox plans.

Whatever you do in the forward stateroom make sure all the bits will fit through the opening (it is originally installed before the deck goes on). I built mine to the plans, but it is literally a 2 minute job to remove all of the woodwork so it is easy to try different layouts to see what suits you best. I have decided to keep the central partition, but have reduced its' height.
