Subject: Re: Building chine runners

After looking over the plans the chine runner is unclear.  It looks straight on the chine side and yet the chine on the boat is curved.  Does anyone have a photos on building the chine and attaching it to the boat?

Like Al said, there was no way I was going to use a single piece of wood for the runners. I cut mine into small blocks and bed them in epoxy. See http://paradoxbuild-johanna.blogspot.com/2007/10/chine-runners.html and http://paradoxbuild-johanna.blogspot.com/2007/10/bottom-fitted.html
