Hi Rodney,

Check out this underwater power supply http://www.nauticexpo.com/prod/lvm/underwater-propeller-power-supply-generator-21773-52007.html. It can be dragged behind the boat on a line and will start charging at 2.5 knts. I found one that outputs 4 amps at 3 knts. Also was thinking wind turbine could be mounted on mast at night with a little work in a mount.. I like the underwater cause I'll just bet if u found a fast stream or river u could anchor and let er charge in the current. Hmmmm....

I notice they don't tell you what the drag is. I suspect it would slow you down quite a bit.

Hoping for calm nights,
Al,
Yeovil, England.
