Let us know how it performs for you and how you plan to set it up.
Another even more important (life saving) use might be to connect the
exerciser up to a watermaker. Something like this one:

Perhaps you could see if the company would be interested in
sponsorship. My feeling is that having enough water is the biggest
challenge to survival, especially if considering taking dehydrated food. 

It might take most of ones energy output just to get enough water to
make some food. A person may also need additional drinking water to
make water if you are in a hot cloudless area for very long.

Also try it out first as some of them put out water that really tastes
yucky,
