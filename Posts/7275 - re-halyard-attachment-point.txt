Jim,

I consider Al the expert when it comes to Paradox other than Matt
himself. So anything I suggest is based on speculation I hope you
understand:-)

I would consider adding a cut-out somewhere along the inner area of your
sacrificial patch. And then attach the halyard about at the centre of
the cut-out and trying it that way? Or you could try to contact Matt for
further instructions. You want the sail to set so there is no girt
between the throat and the clew. A bit of a crease the other way -
between the foot and the tack - is preferred and can be fined tuned out
by easing the tension on the tack a bit - from what I understand.

Perhaps Al could add his thoughts on that?
