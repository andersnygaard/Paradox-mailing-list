But if you raise any part of the cabin by 3 to 4" then you'll need to make the strop longer by the same amount or the boom will foul the hatch (at least mine would).
If you make the strop longer then the boom may not lay parallel to the dog house, the mast will need lengthening and will not fit inside the boat and probably other things that Matt thought of but I haven't worked out yet!
There's a huge number of interdependencies in this design. Believe me, most changes are not for the better.
The designer knows best...

It is only the corner that is a problem, the boom has to be able to rotate about the tack strut deck fitting.

However, if you raise the roof you will have to sit higher when in normal good-weather mode. This may bring your head into conflict with the boom on an unexpected gibe.

There is no obvious reason why you should not lower the cabin sole. The loss of water ballast could be replaced with lead.

If I sit upright my hair just touches the cabin roof, but never when I am sailing as then I am usually lounging in sybaritic languor.

A tip: Make a couple of notches in the cleats that support the seat. When you fold the seat up drop the back edge into the notches and you have an instant sloping backrest. Far more comfortable than the vertical bulkhead.
