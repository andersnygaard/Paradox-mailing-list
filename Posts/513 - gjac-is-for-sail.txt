Subject: GJAC is for sail

One of Matt's older boats if for sale. GJac is similar to Paradox except that she has no cabin top; however, there are accommodations for sleeping one below. Don Musante is selling the 14.5' x 4' x 9" boat. It comes with some cruising gear including anchor, chain, lines, stove, and fenders. A galvanized trailer with new wheels is included. The boat is located in Connecticut and all offers will be considered. DGMusante@aol.com or 860-448-3615.

I notice that Don added leeboards to GJAC because he sailed her "light" like a daysailer, but if it were up to me I would remove them and just add ballast- lots of it. The chine runners should provide enough lateral resistance to go to windward nicely.
