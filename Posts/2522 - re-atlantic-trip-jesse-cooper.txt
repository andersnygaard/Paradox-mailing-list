My mention of Jesse Cooper was actually to a file that Glen posted in which he compared the hull shapes of Little Cruiser and Paradox and how Jesse Cooper also compared. I would love to see how Hogfish Maximus looked in comparison as well.

I believe HM has both a centerboard and chine runners? It also has a much more high tech and expensive sailing rig than the others. And perhaps a more sophisticated hull structure.

Nice to imagine having a yawl rig with a Little Cruiser mainsail treatment. Sort of a modified junk rig without as many strings and battens and so on.

Hogfish Maximus is an interesting design and the most intriguing name I have ever seen for a boat!
