Well done! I recommend you make all the odd bits first (rudder mast yard etc). That way when you finish the hull you are ready to sail. Having the hull there ready and still needing to finish all the bits must be frustrating.

-should the transom sides be curved?

I made mine curved. I may have scaled the amount off the drawing, or more likely used the 5mm as shown on bulkhead 1.

- Are there any issues with epoxying wood strips after they have been steamed to bend them? My concern is with moisture content of the wood before adding epoxy. I am using Douglas fir lumber cut into strips for the deck beams. -

I too used Douglas Fir and the problem didn't occur to me. No problems after 12 years.

what is the side cleat size for bulkhead #4  ?

I used 25x35 as with b'hds 1 & 2. It is not particularly critical, they are just there to give you something to bang the nails into.

Don't form the bevels on the cleats until you come to the trial assembly of the sides. That way they will actually be correct . (Guess how I learned that one. Good thing epoxy is good at filling gaps!) And remember the transom cleat bevels stick out wider than the ply.

Keep the questions coming, we will do our best to answer them.
