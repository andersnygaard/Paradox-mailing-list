I've been wondering why that folder was empty, can we get copies of the ones on Don's group? I've never tried to join because I know he would ban me for spite.

Make up a bogus name with a fictitious Yahoo email account and just join anyway. If the Yahoo stuff is too easy to trace as a list owner, get a new Hotmail address.
