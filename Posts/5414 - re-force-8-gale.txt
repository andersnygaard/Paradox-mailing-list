I started with a length of ordinary copper water pipe, split at the end as per drawing. The split end couldn't take the loads when reefed and collapsed. I now still use water pipe but have made a stainless U piece to fit on top.

The Schedule 40 brass pipe, as called up on the drawings, is not readily available over here, but if it can be obtained it will presumably be ok as drawn.

I drilled the end of the boom, filled it with epoxy, then drilled and tapped for an 8mm bolt. No problems so far.

Because the main sheet is pulling forward there is quite a large bending load on the tang, so make it good and beefy.

Hoping for calm nights
