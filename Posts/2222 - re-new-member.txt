(1) Is there a set of plans for Paradox that is a little bit bigger 
than 14'?

Since the plans are metric it is quite easy to scale up I would 
think. Increasing all the dimensions by 15% still keeps it inside 
two sheets of plywood and gives room for a bed for two without being 
crammed too much.

Matt also gave the all clear on scaling the boat 20% on the same 
scantlings look in the files section under larger paradox for some 
numbers.
