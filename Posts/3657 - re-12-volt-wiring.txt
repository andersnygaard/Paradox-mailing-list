Use the thickest (gage 10) you can afford/borrow :) It will keep you far from any trouble. If you use too thin a gauge of wire it will do two bad things. It will get hot. It will lower your voltage to the thing you energizing. Too thick a wire does not exist. That is to say, it will have no poor consequences. If you can get your wire with a lite tin coating (under the insulation) it will not grow a creepy green crust. Also, if you can get insulated wire intended for aircraft, it would be an extra good choice too. Because the insulation will produce the least toxic smoke, if there should be some sort of excess heat or accidental fire. LED lamps should be very far at the other end of that possibility.

Hi All,

I'm in the process of rewiring my Paradox Whisper and am curious as to what type and gauge of wiring everybody else has used? I have all LED lighting a few Aux. Plugs and a GPS (handheld). I have industrial grade 10 and 16 gauge that we use at work. Any thoughts.

Thanks

David
