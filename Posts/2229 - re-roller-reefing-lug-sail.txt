Hi again Jason,

After posting the last e-mail I went and checked the photo section and could not find anything that would do you much good but if you will look in the files section under topping lift and specifically at TL07.jpg I think you will find the thousand word picture. Good luck with your project and let me know how every thing works out for you.

Tailwinds, 

Glen
