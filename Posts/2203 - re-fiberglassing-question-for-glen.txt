Subject: Re: Fiberglassing question for Glen

Thanks Glen for the info on how you fiberglassed ZOE so nicely. I have to admit that I was beginning to worry that Hurricane Charley washed you and your microcruiser away. Hopefully the hurricane damage in your area wasn't too bad.

Hi Dave 
Sorry to have taken so long to get back to you, please forgive me 
and thank you for the kind words. The cloth I used was 7 oz "E" 
glass which was cheaper then the 6 oz. In the area of the chine 
runners I overlapped the roving four times. My fairing technique is 
to use lots of micro balloons and just pour it on and smooth it out 
with a 12 inch drywall knife whose handle is almost touching the 
surface. It takes a little practice but by the time you get the 
bottom done you should be proficient enough to do the rest of the 
boat pretty quickly. I also turned the boat such that each side, top 
and bottom were up to let gravity help out in the flowing process. 
You can save an enormous amount of time during this phase by always 
applying the next coat of epoxy with in 24 hours so that you don't 
have to sand between coats.
