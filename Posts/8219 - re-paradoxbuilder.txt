Glen,

Thank you for your letter. It would seem that my email was hacked last night - malware posing as "what's app" made its way past G-mails spam filter and started mailing out numerous emails to my contacts. I changed my password, deleted the malware and tried to contact as many people as possible. I sent all the emails to spam and deleted them. I was up until 3pm doing this. The hackers are still trying to break in but G-mails is putting a stop to it.

I apologize for the headache. I wasn't aware this was going on until 11pm.

Craig
