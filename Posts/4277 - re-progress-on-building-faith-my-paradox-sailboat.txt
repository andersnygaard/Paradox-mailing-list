The yuloh plan is on Sheet #12, on the right-hand side. Don't make the same mistake I did by not putting a curve into the shaft.  The drawing shows a 30mm longitudinal concave curve, but the but Sheet #3 measures 50mm.  I'm inclined to go for the larger curve, because the yuloh will fit the deck better and it should be higher gear for when in use.

Cheers,
Bill.
