Nels,
We are situated just outside of Olds, Ab. And I'm not surprised that you didn't see any sailboats. Alberta is not a sailing mecca. There are some places though. Sylvan Lake 45 min. north, Glenmore Lake 90 min. southwest, Ghost Lake souteast of Banff. There are some healthy clubs out here, but you have to have a "yacht" to fit in. Not my type of sailing club.
I prefer the homebuilt "Michalak" crowd myself. And it was Labatt Blue for me, in the longneck bottle, of course.

What part of AB have you emigrated to? I just got back from there before the flooding. I went out through Crowsnest Pass and up 22. Spent the night at Longview and bought some stuff at Ian Tyson's Navaho Mug. Then on to Calgary and up to Banff. 
Two days in Drumheller phootgraphing the badlands on the way home.
Saw lots of horses, antelope, bison, mule deer, elk, one bear and even some moutain goats.
Did not see one sailboat that I recall:-(

Cheers, Nels
