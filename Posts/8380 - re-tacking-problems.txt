Hi John

The reluctance to tack is - for me- the most frustrating thing about my Paradox.
She tacks  Ok in a moderate wind and smooth water but always refuses when well reefed in stronger conditions.

I wonder about the cause of this shortcoming.   Is it due to the hull shape, or, alternately the sail having its centre of effort so far aft?

I have experimented by moving the halyard back along the yard a few inches , but this has its limits as the yard gets nearer to the masthead as you do this, so that there isn't enough room to fully hoist the sail.  Must admit that I didn't notice any difference to the handling during this experiment.

Best
Jim

 Interesting. So how does he control leeway? Leeboards, perhaps; although there are no signs. Centreboard?
 I've recently (last week or so) met Richard, who now owns Minnow. He really
 enjoys sailing her on the river, but says that she won't tack and needs to be helped around with the curved
 sculling oar.  I wonder if this is because chine runners behave rather like a long keel?From a slightly
 different angle, catamarans (the kind with two hulls) are often reluctant to tack. Yet Ray Aldridge has managed,
 by arranging a high aspect ratio dagger board, to get his Slider to tack.Of course, one wouldn't dream of putting a dagger board on a Paradox, but high a/r
 leeboards?  Might be very appropriate on a tiny barge yacht!

Best wishes,

John
