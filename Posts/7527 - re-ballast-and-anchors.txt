Nice job on your Bahamas trip, sounds similar to my last trip, a bit of serious sailing, unseasonal and weird weather, and finally through no fault of your own the boat tries to sink on you. 

The cost of the mantis anchor in the larger size isn't THAT bad, I do like that it comes apart, if only for shipping.
