Thanks Bill,

I had forgotten the name of Steve's boat:-)

A couple of observations based entirely on no personal experience with a
Paradox - so hope others can add their comments.

Steve's tack strop is a beautiful piece of work - far beyond anything I
have seen before. But here is the "however" part. Does it not require
some sort of adjustment mechanism to allow tightening down the luff for
best performance?

My understanding is that a tight luff is required to get the best
performance from a lug sail or any sail for that matter? Thus the down
haul in the origninal plans that runs through the tack strop and into
the cabin.

Secondly - the motor location. For best steerage control the engine
should be located as close to the center line as possible - in order to
"kick" the stern over when changing course.

I located a motor on a canoe somewhat similar to what Steve shows in his
sketch and it resisted turning to starboard in that location. Turning to
port was no problem - but if the wind was off the starboard bow - the
hull would greatly resist turning to starboard and with chine runners it
might even be worse.

I think Bill's advice regarding the motor location is worthwhile
considering.

A special container with the same capacity as the gas tank over even
less - and a long spout would likely overcome any chance of spillage.
There are also special spouts that shut off automatically when the tank
becomes full.
