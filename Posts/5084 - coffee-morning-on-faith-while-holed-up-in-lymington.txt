Hi,

Knowing Bill would be sailing past my home port, I had contacted him and asked if he would contact me should he be in Lymington for a while. Sure enough, with these strong easterlies, Bill invited me around for coffee on Faith this morning. It was most enjoyable; very dry, warm, and snug inside - just the opposite of outside. It was my first time on a Paradox, so it was very interesting for me.

We plan to have a curry tonight at Keyahven Sailing Club, which will give me a chance to show Bill the delights of Keyhaven.

I've added a couple of pics to Paradox in Lymington.

Brian.
