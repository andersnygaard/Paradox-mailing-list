Seems unlikely with a unique and eye-catching boat that is hard to value.

I beg your pardon, but I'm from New York and well I guess we tend to be conspiracy theorists.  Are you sure the remains of the fire are of the boat?  One could easily take the boat off the trailer, replace it with bits of wood or some other boat, put it all back into the container trailer and set it ablaze.  If you think the trucker is not telling you the entire story, then a more thorough investigation seems warranted.

My condolences,
