Perspex (acrylic) isn't as strong as Lexan (polycarbonate) and if you go out to sea in rough weather this could become important.
Yes, easy to reach outside the side windows for cleaning. Possible to reach around the front one too, but a bit of an arm stretch. 

If the wind is up and the sun is shining, the salt spray dries on the windows very quickly - as quickly as you can keep up with wiping it off.  A dry tissue soon gets saturated with salt and can smear it and makes vision worse. So you need a good supply of fresh tissues too.   Using sea water just gives more of the same.  There is never enough fresh water available to wash it off..

It's a bit like driving on an icy  cold day when the road has been sprinkled with salt. The car in front keeps spraying your windscreen with the detritus from its wheels and you have to keep using the screen wash fluid and wipers to keep the windscreen clear.... It's then that the washer fluid runs out because you forgot to refill it...
