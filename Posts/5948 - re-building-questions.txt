Welcome to the group! The scarf question seems to me to be a general guide when nothing else is available. It's not carved in stone. The per plans dimensions make a good boat IMHO. 

The drain hole in the bottom of the trunk vent goes all the way thru. If you look in the photos under Ironsides you'll see that I used a copper tube in stead of plastic pipe. In this way I made an electrical conection to the sea water thru the wire inside the mast and the copper tube. The portion of tube in contact with the water must be bare/naked, no paint, no fiberglass, just raw copper. The upper end of the tube has a tab or finger which runs across the mast step pocket. The mast stands upon it for a connection.
