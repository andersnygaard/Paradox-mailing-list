Turnbuckles!? :) We don't need no stinking turnbuckles! :) I seem to remember that Matt designed this boat to be very unstabile upside down. The high arch in the deck is from this effort. I believe that in any crazy kind of weather that would have a knockdown would also heve enough waves and swells to easily allow the ballasted hull to turn right side up quickly enough that any wee bit of water entering would be ok. I, however, have never heard from anyone that there has been a knockdown yet. On dwg. 9 there is a note by Matt that the vents are intended to prevent SIGNIFICANT WATER INTRUSION in any conditions Including 180 degree knockdown. Do you have a copy of the plans? There are no turnbuckles. The mast is freestanding. There is plenty of ballast called out on the plans. Also there is lots of bouyancy in the insulation too. There is a chart that shows the plotted stability at various angles. I'll try to find it. Good Luck, Steve Yahn
