Subject: Re: Anyone building a paradox 

Hello Al, if you dont mind me asking how tall are you? If I rember right the floor had 6'2" of length so maby you are closer to my height. Its good to know that the sleeping area can be extended please let me know your results next weekend.

I'm only 5'6". The cabin as drawn is ideal for me to sleep in. The reason I have enlarged the access forward is so that I can put my bike in there. When you get somewhere, being limited to walking can dramatically limit your range ashore. On the trailer, having a flat floor right through to bulkhead 1 with no dividers seems to make the access for clothing, bedding etc much easier. We shall see what it is like when we are afloat.

As far as Swaggie, I will look at her again but paradox size, cost , and the shallow draft are better for me. Around here we mostly have calm lakes with tree stumps just below the surface so shallow draft are prefeered for camping boats. And the shallow draft will allow some river adventures. But most important I want to have paradox to duplicate the trips made by Matt and David into the Bahamas.

I should think that Swaggie is a bit of a handful to get on and off a trailer whereas, with the right trailer, Paradox is easy.

Hoping for calm nights
