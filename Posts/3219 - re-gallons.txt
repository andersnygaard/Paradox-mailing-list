Hi Nels,

Never been confronted by an American beer although I quite liked root beer when Macdonalds used to sell it :0) I'm fond of Stella Artois and a few obscure English breweries but I don't drink much nowadays. I would still enjoy the lightheaded, carefree, optimism that alcohol imparts (I'm a happy drunk), but I'm finding it harder to get up of the floor.

Americans don't do football. As far as I can see they do a type of rugby mixed with all in wrestling. None of the grace of a Thierry Henry or Denis Bergkamp there. But never mind because in spite of their football Americans are the most generous strangers one can hope to meet.
