Subject: Re: Minimalist sail-inside designs

I've changed the topic, since this thread no longer has anything to do with ordering the build manual.

I don't think it would be at all difficult to turn Sand Flea into a sail-inside, at least not if you are relatively short.  All it needs is a minimal canvas cover over the top of the cockpit opening, much like the one on the Enigma 360.

Sand Flea already has a soft top!

As to cubes, any number of roughly cubical boats have been *proposed* over the years, but I'm not sure if any of them have been sailed successfully!

-- Bolger Superbrick

-- Gilbert Skippy (see the "Around in Ten" site)

Jury's out on that one. I'll believe it when I see it sail.

-- Selway-Fisher Micro 8 and Micro 10

Not boats for pottering around the coastline however and I don't see any rush for anyone to buid one.
