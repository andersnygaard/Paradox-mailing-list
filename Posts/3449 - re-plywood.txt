For mixing epoxyI use plastic syringes from the local farm supplies.They come in a variety of sizes,cost only pence.and can be used many times over.
My epoxy came from CFS in Cornwall.They are reputed to be good value and their products work well.They are cirtainly cheaper than buying from chandlers or boatyards.Their staff are very helpful and they do a mail order service.
