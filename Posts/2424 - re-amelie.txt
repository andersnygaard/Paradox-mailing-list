Hi Paul,

That's the guy I called once as well. Not an easy name to remember:-)

And I probably read the same article. I am wondering if it was in a Common Sense Newsletter that Benie Wolfard published?

I am currently visiting my son in British Columbia so don't have access to my own phone. I could follow up on it when I get back home in a week or so.

Cheers, Nels
