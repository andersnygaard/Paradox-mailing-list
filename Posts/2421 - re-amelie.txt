    I support the effort to enlarge Matt's original design (with his
    apparent, tacit blessing) but I don't think the use of steel is
    appropriate at these sizes even with the scaled stretch. The weight
    additions throughout the design would preclude another look at weight
    distribution, displacement and ultimate stability.

    Still, if you could get Matt on board, you might have a really tough,
    coastal cruising, world beater on your hands in the end. That, alone,
    would be worth the effort.
