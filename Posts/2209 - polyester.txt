Subject: polyester? 

Hi folks! 

My Paradox now looks like a boat in its first stage of dry run. It's a lot of sealing surfaces with epoxy in the instructions. What about polyester? Costs 1/4 of epoxy. Does polyester and epoxy work together? For instance, in layers on the bottom. Has anyone tried? I'd be grateful for any aspect on the matter.
