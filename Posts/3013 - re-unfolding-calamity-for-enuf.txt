Thanks to every one for the advice.

What I have done so far is ignore it and cut the blanks for the boom and yard. At least there has been a little forward progress and I am looking forward to planing them into shape tomorrow.

The forecast for tomorrow is good so I'll try the wheeling the hull out in to the direct sunshine and coat it with black bin bags. I will also try a hardener rich mix on my rudder blade and rudder stock because I coated them with the end of the mix and they haven't set either. In fact, I'll try that in a minute, although they have been in the sun for about 5 hours today.

The resin and hardener was an opened couple of containers that I may have bought in June. I used almost all of the 3.75Kg on the fabric and after 5 hours used the remainder mixed with fairing filler to fill the weave of the cloth. Neither application has set (as yet).

They mixing is unlikely to be faulty because we used the proper pumps and were mixing up 0.5 litre amounts at a time. If my boy made the occasional mistake it would have likely evened out anyway.

I told the proprietor of UK Epoxies what has happened and he commiserated. To be honest, I have been very happy with his stuff and he has been very helpful with advice at odd hours of the day. I've ordered replacement biaxial, filler and resin/hardener - 130 quid! It's a good job the wife works. If things go on like this I may have to go back full time. Perish the thought!!

Again thanks for the help. What a lovely bunch you are.
