There are no plans for Little Cruiser, but get in touch with Dave Bolduc at http://www.microcruising.com/ He owns Little Cruiser and I believe he hopes to create some plans. (He also sell the Paradox plans)

Paradox needs 10 sheets of ply (6mm up to 18mm). I used between 40 and 50 litres of epoxy and quite a lot of timber.

Hoping for calm nights
