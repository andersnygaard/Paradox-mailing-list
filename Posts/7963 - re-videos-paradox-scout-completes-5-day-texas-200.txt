Hi Sean,

All these changes being made by Yahoo are killing these Groups. I'm certain if you had made a post like this two years ago there would have been heaps of responses.

Anyway, I've watched all your videos and loved them! Particularly, that first one where you rescued the PDR. The look on your face when you're sitting there after the tow had started. Classic. Also great to see footage of that event from the PDR!

Finally, finished painting my Philsboat today; it will be out of the shed mid-week with a tarpulin over it and then the Paradox build can begin! The questions will probably start then too which might liven this forum up a bit.

Thanks again for these videos. I know they take a long time to prepare, but they do inspire.

Cheers,

Rob
