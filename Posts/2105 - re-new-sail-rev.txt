As one of those who has experienced the slow tacking of a Paradox I would like to put it in perspective.

Compared to a centre-board dinghy Paradox is sluggish when coming about.

Paradox is a heavy displacement craft (14ft long and over half a ton). It has the equivalent of a full length keel. 

I have no experience of the tacking ability of other heavy displacement craft with full length keels, but I would suggest that Paradox probably behaves as would be expected from the numbers.

Hi all

Referring to my earlier posting 1478, I am still wondering about how a lug rig works, since I am about to order the sail. There have been several testimonies on that the Paradox is slow to come about. Could part of the explanation be that the part of the sail that is before the mast is too small? i.e., the part representing "the jib"? In that case 1478 makes sense, thus it would be an advantage to move the halyard attachmen to the aft, 200 mm. On the other hand, the lug sail is pretty free to move around quite a lot as I understand it, so the whole thing might be obsolete. Any insights in the dynamics of the lug rig?
