Ok Kjellkkk, I just got off the phone to Fiberglass Coatings (1-800-272-7890) they have nine pails of T-12 in stock ($37.50) and 3 one gallon containers ($7.50) as well as Quarts and Pints. The gal there told me that the Hazard Materials cost for shipping anything over a gal is $20 an item. There is no HazMat charge for shipping less then a Gallon. Get their catalog they are one of the cheapest places I have found for buying epoxies.
