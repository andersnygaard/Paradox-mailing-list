Subject: Re: Epoxy and Varnish

Hi Jeff

Thanks for the idea which I have followed through.

A phone call elicited a response so speedy that I wondered if it hadn't been learnt by rote 
for these occasions. 

Because the reply left me feeling a little uneasy I have sent three photos of the knots to 
Robbins and invited them to consider their answer after seeing the pics.

I've told them that I am quite happy to epoxy the gaps if that is their considered opinion.

I'll let you know what happens.

Cheers ....... Derek
