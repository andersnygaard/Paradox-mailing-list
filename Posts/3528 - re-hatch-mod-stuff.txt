Hello Al,

I understand the point you make about obstructed visibility with the dome but the dome will be constructed from narrow welded steel section with lexan or plexi giving as much visibility as possible.
As I said previous the amount of "foldings" can be adapted to have 2 or 3 settings which leave the chance to have- a halve closed hatch- fully open or closed hatch.
I'm sure that both systems have their own advantages and it's up to the builder to choose which one he likes the best.
The folding hatch is much easier to build but offers possibly less watertight protection in a roll over.
The sliding hatch is a proven concept for sure but as with many mechanical things, when it goes too smooth, it probably doesn't do the job it was designed for.

I only hope that my idea of the folding hatch doesn't start a war of words, it's not worth the issue and the energy.
