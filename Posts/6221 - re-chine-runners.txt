Hi Al,

Yes that is my understanding as well. Yet I have seen videos of you and Bill still moving right along with the hull quite upright it seems. Maybe Paradox doesn't have to heel much with the relatively heavy displacement and the amount of rocker?

The Bolger and Michalak sharpies of lighter displacement sail "over the water and not through it" and that is why the bow and stern are raised above the water. They drop down to skim the water when the boat heels about 20 to 30 degrees. This lengthens the waterline as the lee chine immerses more and lowers the wetted surface as the weather chine rises above the surface.

Jim when talking about his initial AF2 design:
"It looks quite good to me and I have been taught to look at it with Phil Bolger's eyes. He said sharpies need to sail over the water and not through it. The bow is swept well above the water to meet the waves with the bottom and not pushing through them with the sides. The stern is also well out. She would have a short waterline bolt upright as in light winds, minimum wetted surface area so they say. But a sailing breeze would heel her over to get a longer waterline when there is power in the wind. And heeled she would meet the waves with the edge of her chine like a V bottomed boat. It all works great provided the conditions are right. The best case is a strong wind with smooth water. The worst case is rough water and little wind. So sharpies have split personalities much more so than V bottomed or round bottomed boats.
I might add that the short upright waterline helps a lot for quick maneuvering."

This would seem to indicate that his designs are more suitable for inland ("smooth") waters and not suitable for chine runners as they are not deep enough "in" the water.
