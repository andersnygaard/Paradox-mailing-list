I'm (slowly) building a smaller Paradox.  So far, for the most part, I've tried to keep it as much as practical to the original specs, but at 85% of scale.  85% of 420 centimeters = 357cm.

Originally, I debated between recording my build in this group or the enigma_sailboat group, and kept it here since the hull is basically a small Paradox, not an Enigma.  This way, it might help a future builder working through scale modifications (smaller or larger).

I'm starting to lean toward other modifications that may distract from this group's core function, so I'm planning on moving my build album to the microcruising group.  The album is titled 'Po.'

Respectfully,

Bobby
