Hi DC,

Just wondering if you have sold your hull yet?

I know a person who might be interested and has some questions.

1. Are you still planning to post some more photos showing it's current state of completion?

2. Did you have it figured out how much more money would be involved to complete it? Spars, sails,running and ground gear and paint and building the cabin would seem to be the remaining expenses. Any estimates how much time it would involve? I expect it would be a great winter project.

3. Not sure if the hull is glassed and the chine runners finished either.

I have a trailer that would work and am going to B.C. in a month or so and could haul it back with me if a deal can be worked out.

It would be cash, based on my reccomendation and from the photos posted I am giving him my vote of confidence that he will not be disappointed in the workmanship!

Cheers, Nels
