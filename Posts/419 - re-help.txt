I think some UK books get/got limited circulation in the US. I've been looking for the "Lugworm" series of books for a couple of years now. ("Lugworm" was a Dracombe Lugger sailed from the UK to Greece and back.)

If you see the Lugworm and/or Shrimpy books in a local book shop in decent condition, and if you're willing, i'll send money! In fact if there's any sort of book finding service...
