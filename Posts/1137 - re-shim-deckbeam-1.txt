Subject: Re: Shim deckbeam #1?

Hi Andrew.

Thanks for the reply. I remember that the design called for the deck camber of #3 to be plotted without the benefit of the deck camber template. After I plotted as designed, I compared with my camber template and discovered that I would run into a situation as you describe; #3 too high. I used my template instead, and figured that I could shim to the deck if necessary.

I'm accustomed to fairing the lines of a boat before I begin building. With this boat, I have at times felt a little apprehensive, due to the "instant boat"/"Norwegian pram" nature of construction. I'm putting a lot of trust in the design, without the benefit of working from a full scale lofting. It's good to be able to compare with others in the group.

Hey, laminating the chine runners before installing the bottom; there's a new twist. I look forward to seeing your new photos, and reading your progress report. I hope to get some pics up soon, as well.
