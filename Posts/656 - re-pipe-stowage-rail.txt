Hi David,

This is a correction to my previous post, I used 5/8" holes and not 3/4". The 3/4" holes would be stronger but the 5/8 have been fine

Hi All,

Does anybody have any thoughts on how to install the P&amp;S pipe stowage rails. My plan was to mount a backing plate under the deck and drill a 1/2 inch hole, fit the rail and fill with epoxy. Any thoughts or comments?

David
