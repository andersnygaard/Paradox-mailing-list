Jason,

Oh neat, I thought you reverted to the normal keel.

How did you come to the conclusion that chine runners would not work? 
The slab sides are certainly flat enough, although the bottom is much 
more curved. I was wondering if it would hobby horse by having the 
weight moved up, or some other unseen consequence. 

Any pictures up anywhere?
