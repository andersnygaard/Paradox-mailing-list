There are no actual building plans. Rolf Eliasson drew up the hull and deck with no particular cabin layout. The boats that have been built have had varying deck configurations layed out by their respective builders. The model was built from 2d cad files of the hull, which included the curved side deck, supplied to me by Christer. The files did not include the rudder, centerboard, mast etc. Just the standard three views, so just the hull and deck are accurate. I used the sketches and pictures from his website to make up a mock rudder, and centerboard. I used a stretched version of the Paradox cabin, as it was already built.
