Bill, at 6'4" you are going to find the standard cabin a little short 
for sleeping in. However I can confirm that it is quite possible to 
enlarge the opening to the forward stateroom so that it is flush with 
the cabin floor. I have just performed this operation on Little Jim 
and so far it looks like a general improvement. I am going to be 
afloat next weekend, so will report back on the pros and cons next 
week.

Hoping for calm nights

Al,
Yeovil, England.
