Hi Greg,

Here is an optional design that gives more interior room, but if off-set masts rankle you then you may not be open to it. (The mast location can be easily changed however.)

It is called Philsboat and is the subject of a feature article here: http://duckworksmagazine.com/

If you go down a bit there is also the designers latest newsletter with some information. And if you look in the plans section you will see many more plans from this designer.

I am not suggesting this boat has the remarkable capabilities of a Paradox but several have been built all over the world and every builder has been quite pleased with the design.

At least it should give you some ideas for thought.
