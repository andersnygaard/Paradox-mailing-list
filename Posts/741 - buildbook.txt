Paul V,

I notice in your BuildBook/Paradox.rtf entry in the Files that you have "Notch for chine and clamp logs" against each bulkhead. Do NOT cut this out until the sides are on. Make the horizontal cut but leave the corner attached as you will use this for the vertical location with the side panels. Once the sides are on the vertical cut can be made and the corner drops out (if you have remembered not to put glue on it! :-)

Hoping for calm nights.
