Hi Folks

My enquiry really was centred around why barbed ring
nail instead of screws?  It 's the mechanical merits
I'm asking about rather than the corrosion resistance
of different metals.

Would seem to me that wood screws have advantages:
that you can take them out without damage to dismantle
something might be a handy attribute. I would imagine
that trying to pull out a barbed nail is likely to
cause some co-lateral damage

Hmm not sure of brass screws from a certain mass
market retailer in the Uk.... What about the risk of
de-zincification and all that?

My father worked in a boatyard while I was growing up. They made 
boats of plywood. It was just before fiberglass became popular. And 
from all of that I gathered a general idea of the practical side of 
metal fasteners in wooden boats. In the very old days when boats were 
made of planks of wood and fiberglass was not in existance, bronze 
made sense. The wood got damp from being in the water year round. 
This was the cheapest in the long run. Later on there were many 
trailerable boats which only got wet now and then. For these boats 
hot dipped galvanized screws and nails  was more practicle for the 
money. Wealthy show offs would use bronze because thats how it's 
done. Nowadays with epoxy acting to hermeticly seal the metal away 
from even the sleightist trace of humidity galvanized steel is very 
good and not a wast of money in the short run, and excellent over the 
long run too. So If you have a pre-war museum piece of a boat then 
use bronze. If you have a trailer boat use galvanized. If you keep 
your boat in the water year round maybe use bronze. There is a little 
saying; "Nail where you can, screw where you should, and bolt when 
must" (this is not about the bedroom!)
Ring shanked nails are cheaper than screws. Besides
hot dipped galvanized nails are very rough surfaced from the
zinc. After a hot dipped galvanized nail is driven in it is next to
imposible to remove it. The wood fibers are bent inward and grab on to
the toothy texture. A bronze nail would be ok except it is
slippery. So to be as good as a hot dipped galvanized nail the bronze nail
has the annular grooves rolled onto it during manufacturing. Also
most of the humble work boats which were left in the water all the time
had hot dipped galvanized fastenings, Just like the above saying.
The high society of wooden boat magazine and very yachty literature
on boating love to talk about bronze everything as thou it was still
1910. The big majority of honest boats in the world use hot dipped
galvanized fastenings or plain steel. There is no such thing a
iron or wrought iron any more. This topic is a little risky because
it ends up in a debate which has the same smell as politics or
religon. My intent here is to share my own particular view, for it's
USA, west coast, history and setting. Good luck choosing. Steve Yahn
