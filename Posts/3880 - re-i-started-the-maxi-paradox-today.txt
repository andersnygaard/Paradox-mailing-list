Hi Niels.

You must make sure the you place the centreboard so that when down the CLR is the same as when the board is up.
I would guess that this would put the board midships.
On the WaterTribe page http://www.watertribe.com/ChallengeViewer/default.aspx the video -
Wizard - Sailing as he goes outside and then comes in the St. Marys Inlet, ENIGMA, to me is sailing to windward quite respectably in choppy waters with a cap full of wind.
I would be more than happy with that performance especially when you consider she sports a lug sail rig and Matt has freed her off a bit to keep her going.
Is a centreboard really worth the extra hassle?
