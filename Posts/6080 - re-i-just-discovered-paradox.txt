Subject: Re: I just discovered Paradox

This is the most amazing 14 foot sailboat design I have ever seen.

Am I wrong to think that it is possible and practical to build this in a one-car garage?  I live in an apartment, so I don't have some of the space that you house-dwellers do.  But I *do* have my own 1-car garage right there in the apartment complex.  Just have to clean my junk out!

I built Little Jim in my garage (and a UK garage is probably smaller than a US one). I built it on a wheeled dolly so I could push it out for easier access.

How many Paradox building are first-time boat builders (excluding simple dinghies like Tortoise)?  Are there many "gotchas"?

My previous experience was an 8 foot pram dinghy about 25 years ago. I think you would have to be very ham fisted to get it wrong, but it is not a quick build. I took 18 months, others have taken several years.

It is a splendid boat for living aboard for weeks, or months, at a time but it is only good for single handing. If you want company on board you would probably be better looking elsewhere.

There is masses of storage on board for one person, I now regularly carry my bicycle simply because the space was there and was not being used.

Hoping for calm nights
