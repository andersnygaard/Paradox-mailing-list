Subject: Re: Steel?

I think you guys have lost the plot when you talk about building or having someone else build your PARADOX in steel.

If your sailing skills are that non-existant in that you cannot read a chart or see any dangers a hundred yards ahead take up golf or buy a white stick.

I think the whole thing about PARADOX is that she can be built by anyone with low woodworking skills.

Steel, although stronger would be overkill adding extra design problems. Remember, the chine runners are shown shaped for a reason. Would you make that shape in steel or wood?

Round tubing at the chine with the sheet steel welded to it would leave a round edge, use some filler to fair in the runners?

Wooden deck fitted to steel hull? Even the professionals can get it wrong.

Matt has sailed PARADOX thousands of miles and the boat is good for lots more.

An extra layer of cloth on the bottom is all you need.
