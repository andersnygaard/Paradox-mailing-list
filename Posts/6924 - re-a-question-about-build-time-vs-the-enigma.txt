Subject: Re: A question about build time vs the Enigma.

I think many would-be builders of Paradox are put off by the amount of effort it takes to complete, me for one. So I have been thinking that if I do undertake a build, I would use aluminum which is stronger and would, I think, cut down on the time significantly.
