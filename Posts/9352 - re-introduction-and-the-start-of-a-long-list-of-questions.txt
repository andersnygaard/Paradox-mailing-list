Welcome to the group Cory.

I am glad to read that you are continuing the work to get the paradox where she belongs; out upon the seas.

In regard to the shape of the bow, I do not know the reason for the design shape; however, I never considered altering the shape because I found the boat's handling to be very satisfactory.

I am located in New York and can sail Lake Ontario. Andre-Francois is a Canadian with two paradox boats. We are always looking to go paradoxical sailing with others. When your boat is ready, look us up. We can meet and mess bout.

Welcome,

Deric
