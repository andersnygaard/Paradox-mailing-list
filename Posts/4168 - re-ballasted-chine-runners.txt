Subject: Re: Ballasted Chine Runners

One way to solve some of these issues (and I'm sure create more!) would be to forgo casting, glassing chinerunners altogether.   

Could it be possible to bolt a large slab of steel, a bit like a wing under your paradox.   You can shape it with a grinder to smooth the water flow.   You could also make it somewhat wider than you might normally do, as a test.  You could always lop some off so to speak.   
 
A paradox, with a 2' X 6' 3/4" thick "wing" of steel might be an interesting way to get lots of ballast, and some chinerunner foils at the same time.
