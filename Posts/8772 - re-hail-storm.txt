If someone could help me out i need some advice on how to repair this damage. I posted a pic of outside and inside of the damaged area.

Thank You,

I don't know a lot about repairs like this, but I do know that the sides are under constant bending loads and you will somehow have to oppose those forces after injecting epoxy into the break. All I can think of is putting newsprint on either side over the top of the epoxy and then screwing two squares of 6mm plywood scrap right through the hull side into each other. After the epoxy sets remove the scraps, sand away the paper, fill in your screw holes and then cover the whole lot both inside and out with 200gm epoxy fabric.

I was amazed that you had to remove your roof cladding. What was it made of? In NZ our roof cladding is usually long run corrugated iron or concrete tiles and I've never heard of hail stones severely damaging them. Then again I've never heard of softball sized hail stones either. Golf ball size is about the largest I've ever heard of around here.
