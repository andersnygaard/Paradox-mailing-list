I think there are a few pedal gens out there. I've seem them online a few times but its just as easy to build one using bicycle parts and a permanent magnetic alternator.

Very little energy is wasted through heat.....probably no more than pedaling the prop directly. Its funny that this subject should come up, because I am about to begin construction of a new concept boat that will use a large wind turbine and solar panels as main propulsion. .....the boat is called the Micro13 Robb
