My experience with plastic tarps is that they need to have a clear space of air between the tarp and the boat to prevent focused light/heat from reaching the surface.

A similar exercise has been brought home to me when I have left a Tupperware kayak sitting on the lawn during the summer months. The sun's light is focused on the plastic at the bottom of the cockpit and the grass beneath is killed in less than an hour, leaving a dead spot that takes weeks to get back to normal.

I would guess that the same thing has happened to your fresh paint. The comments about the lack of a full cure are another consideration that would create an additional vulnerability.
