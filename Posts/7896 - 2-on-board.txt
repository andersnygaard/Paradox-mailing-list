Hi all,

This is my first post. I live in São Paulo - Brazil and felt in love with this wonderful design. I recently finished my first boat, a Michalak's Piccup Pram named Sussa, a much simpler design for sure.

Reading the Microcruising website thought about Little Cruiser as an ideal boat for 2 adults (me and wife) to cruise a few days along our coast on vacation periods. Paradox lines handled within the cabin and chinne runners freeing the interior are very good features I like. 

Searched the posts for comments about sailing and camping Paradox with 2 adults on board, but could not find reference to that.

Is that doable and safe ? Should I think about building her 10% bigger to come close to Little Cruiser specs ?

I welcome any comment.

All the best,

André.
