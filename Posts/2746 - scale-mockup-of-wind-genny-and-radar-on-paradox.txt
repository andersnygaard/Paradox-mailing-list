Subject: Scale mockup of wind genny and radar on Paradox

I was curious to see if a wind generator and radar could be fitted to Paradox, so for a mental exercise I made a scale mockup. It's in the paradoxbuilders2 group file section.

The Wind generator is Southwest Windpower's 13 pound Air-X Marine, and the Radar is the JRC's under 9 lb Radar 1000 Mk II.
