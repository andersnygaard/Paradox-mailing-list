For those of you with a subscription to "Messing About in Boats," you'll have a real treat in the August 15 issue. Our very own Glen Maxwell has a great article and some nice photographs of his 2001 shakedown cruise on the West Coast of Florida. Of course Glen speaks highly of ZOE during his six day trip, but he also takes the time to list several improvements he made along the way. For the angler, he even has a few tips on how to catch the occasional fish for dinner. Oh well, I guess you'll have to read the story for yourself...
