The chine runners on Jubilee and HM are much different then on Matt's designs, Morejohn is approaching the design of his runners from his perspective of whats going on at the chine/hull junction. I found on the Atlantic crossing that his runners tend to be wetter then Matt's because they don't extend back as far. Also Morejohn's runners are not as aerodynamicly shaped as Matt's nor are they as wide as they would be if scaled from a Paradox's.
