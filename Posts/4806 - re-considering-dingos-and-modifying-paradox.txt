Thanks Jeff,

She's an interesting boat and she could be the answer for a good many people.  It's a shame Matt is too busy to draw and market the plans, likewise plans for Enigma.  Maybe he considers he would not make enough money to warrant his time.  As it is he must be extremely busy building his boat for the Around in Ten Race prior to giving her sea trials in preparation for the start in a year's time.

Semantics would demand a new name for the extended boat such as ParadoxPlus, ParadoxToo or ParadoxForTwo!

Bill.
