I've been using a special epoxy formulated for drinking water storage, aquariums, and food containers, available from the French compay SICOMIN:

This particular epoxy product is not listed on the web site, but you can find it in the downloadable catalog referenced as Aquapox 8500 2324.

I have also been using their other epoxy products for the past two years without any problems. Staff is very helpful in providing advice, and prompt in handling orders and shipping.

Being based in France myself, SICOMIN is a cost-effective alternative compared to companies based in the U.K. or the U.S.A. I don't know how competitive they would be once you add shipping, tax, and customs charges.

You have to complete a form on the site to get full product documentation. I assume they've got documentation in English, because the site is in English and French.

I've got the French datasheet for the Aquapox product, if anyone is interested. It's comprehensible if you've got a modicum of French or are familiar with technical language associated with epoxy formulations.
