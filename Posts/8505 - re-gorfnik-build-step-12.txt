Thanks for the updates on Gorfnik. My own build is slowly coming together. I'm waiting for glue to dry so I can get my clamps back for the next job. I need to dig around and find a few more real clamps to do the curved bottom strips.
The more I see of this design, the more I like it. I'm trying to include all the little details that I'm sure took you a lot of thinking and probably modifying to get to the finished boat.
I deleted my previous PDF file for this boat from the files section of this group but will add the finished file back later.
For now, in case anyone is interested (especially Chris), Here is a link to my Dropbox folder with my LATEST version of the plans.
