No matter what size the chine runners would not be a difficult undertaking if fabricating from steel. period. you really do not want to use so many dissimilar materials.

The chine runners to be made in steel would be quite an undertaking.
The radius under the outside edge of the runner I believe could be done away 
with if building in steel making the job easier.
But a more simple way would be to make the Chine Runners in a 
hardwood(Oak/Teak?).
Drill a series of holes(6") along the bottom edge of the side panel to take 
the bolts that secure the runner.
Pass the bolts through from the inside and braze outside in position.
I believe you can braze S/S to mild steel but is there a reaction in a 
marine environment?
Transfer the hole positions to the back of the runner and drill to suit.
Lay the runner on its back face and counter bore the holes to take a nut and 
washer making sure a socket head wrench/spanner will fit on the nut.
Offer up the runner and dry fit with nuts and washers and mark the bolts 
with a felt tip pen around the bolts for length.
Remove the runner and cut bolts to the marks.
If required deepen the counter bores so the nuts and bolts are below the 
outside surface.
Paint the back face of the runner with an appropriate wood sealer.
Apply mastic to the back face of the runner and fit.
Glue and insert wooden plugs(grain going fore'n'aft) in the bolt holes, coat 
with wood sealer and clean up filling gaps with mastic.
