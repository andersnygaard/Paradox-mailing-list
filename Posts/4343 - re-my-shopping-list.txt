Subject: Re: My shopping list?

Jeff(in particular but anyone else please pipe in),

I've been doing a bit of research, epoxy wise, and I've decided to go with the MAS product. You obviously have a bit of experience with thisand we're building in similar conditions, so I'm after some advice. (again!)

You say you use the Low viscosity resin. Is this the only resin you use? The web site spec seems to suggest that this is a good resin for wetting out cloth in particular, whereas it would seem to recommend the FLAG resin for bonding and laminating because it is less likely to slump.

As my first tasks will be mainly (you guessed) bonding and laminating, should I go for the FLAG and leave the Low viscosity for when I'm in a position to start sheathing filling and fairing? I suppose I could get 6 litres of each initially to see how they compare to one another.

The other thing is the hardners. They just give you too much choice. I'm sort of erring towards the medium as the best of both worlds, enough open pot time, and no amin blush. I can imagine I'm going to need plenty of time when it comes to fitting the sheer calmps and chine logs, so i may have to get some slow hardner to give me a bit more time. Also I can't even begin to imagine how I'll ever get the bottom glued up and fitted quickly enough, but I'm sure I'll cross that bridge when I eventually come to it!

What fillers do you use for glueing and bonding? Cabosil seems the way to go but I'm still confused over the uses for the cellulose fibres and the wood flour? I expect the fibres are good at gap filling (hopefully I won't have too many of those), but I can see i'm going to end up of all sorts of tubs of fillers if I'm not careful when I may not actually need them.

Anyway hopefully the ply will arrive before the weekend and i can cut wood in earnest.
