Subject: design help needed

Dear group,

I am looking to build a boat similar to the michalik jewelboxjr using the paradox "wings" and eliminating the leeborad to simplify the design. I would appreciate any advice or guidance you can offer, as I am an old man looking to build a very simple camp cruiser.

Thank you for your help.

Sincerely,
Grover
