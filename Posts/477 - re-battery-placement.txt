Subject: Re: Battery Placement

I am busy screwing up my nerve to get going on my 1.1 version.  Tax money should hit any day now.  I will build a tent, buy some bronze ring nails and epoxy and start on the stem and molds for the beams as soon as I hear the cash register ring.

By the way, what do you think the purpose for the wall in the forward cabin is?  Is it just to hole the battery in place?
