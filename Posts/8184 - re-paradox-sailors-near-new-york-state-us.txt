Deric,

I didn't start any new boats since building the other two and have no immediate plans to start.  The other boats were "quick and dirty" builds so it depends on who you ask if it counts as boat building experience.  I had build threads for both of them on the wooden boat forum but deleted them because too many people complained about newbies encouraging less than perfect building methods and materials.

I'm close to 300 miles away from Syracuse around Clearfied, PA.  Most of my boating is in ponds, rivers, and a small lake so none of my boats have (or really need) any electric or gas propulsion.  The sail is fun to play with but a paddle is more useful for my own boating.

My goal is to have a boat that I can camp in and the Paradox was the only one of Matt's boats that had actual plans available.  The Enigma, Elusion, or even Sand Flea would work better for me mainly due to their lighter weight and easier build.  I'll probably take bits and pieces from several designs and combine them into something that will work for my own needs and low budget.  I won't try to encourage anyone else to copy my crude methods of building boats but I now have 2 homemade boats that got me out on the water and they cost me very little time or money to make so I'm happy and have no regrets.

Brian
