I am going to re-draw the mast drawing full size as a vector graphic. I can then take measurements from any part and also print it out full size if need be.

I am going to eventually re-draw the whole set of plans as vectors. Give me something to do whilst I am waiting to build the actual boat. It also means that I could get all the component laser or CNC cut if I wanted to. I think this will also give me a better understanding of the plans.
