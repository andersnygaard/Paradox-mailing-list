Lezlie,
The floor timbers need to be beveled to match the line of the rocker. This means that they extend below the bulkhead which you will have marked out. Look carefully at the location of the floor timbers in relation to the bulkhead stations. Bkhd 1 &amp; 2 need a slight bevel, 3 virtually none, 4 a little and the transom actually requires the most. The bevels are "left standing" in other words proud of the bulkheads themselves and planed to shape using a straight edge as a guide once you've done the initial assembly and fitted the chine logs.

You can pick the bevels up from the line drawing (you'll be using that sheet a lot initially) along with the side bevels. I wouldn't fret too much over them, as they are going to need a bit of work when it comes to assembly, but I found my side cleat bevels pretty close by picking up the angles off the line drawings.

Hope that helps.
Pete
