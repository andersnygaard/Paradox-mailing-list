Great stuff

I look at your blog every evening to see if there is any new update.

I don't know the area where you are now , so had to use an atlas to help interpret your latest two reports.

I see that you've travelled quite a long way so far. very impressed . Hat off to you Sir.

The weather is very chilly at the moment and it must feel perishing cold, even if you sail Faith with the hatch closed. I bet that the hot water bottle will be working overtime for a few days.

If you get the right wind and weather, would you consider sailing non-stop for 48 hours or so to make distance while conditions are favourable? Not sure if you have nav lights etc., or if Faith can hold a steady course while you get a little nap.

Good luck

48 hours would be my maximum for coastal cruising and I have done it before, but I prefer getting a good night at a haven.

I have a legal light for navigation for a boat of 'Faith's' length, i.e., an all round masthead light - a torch would satisfy the Regulations, but I also carry a powerful flash lamp to shining at any approaching ship or vessel if I think a collision could be possible; I also carry white flares for the same purpose.
