Subject: Re: Number of Paradox's built to date

That list is very far from being a true account of all Paradoxes built, or being built.  Dave Bolduc propably has information on the number of plans sold, but for privacy I doubt he would supply the names and address of these people.  I would love to have such a list, because I would write to asking the recipients if they had built their boats so that I could make a really useful list of owners and builders.
