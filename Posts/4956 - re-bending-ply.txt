Hi Pete.

NOLI is the same size and layout as PARADOX but built a lot lighter.
Her deck is made from 1/4" marine ply and was an easy fit.
The bulkheads were over cut before installation and after setting up the kingplank was installed, giving a straight centre line through to the stem.
Using a fair batten 1/4" square, which was clamped to each bulkhead, touching down on the kingplank and both sheer clamps.
A pencil line drawn and then cut and planed to it.
I had prior put a bevel to the sheer clamps for the approximate angle of the deck edge.
With a layer of glass cloth and the cockpit carlin, which goes from the transom through to the stem, the deck is quite strong while being lighter while easy to build.
The deck was done in two halve to save on materials.
In one or two places the deck did not quite touch the bulkheads I just left, as there was going to be a fillet there anyway.
