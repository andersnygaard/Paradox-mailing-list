Thank you, John, for noting the word variation. I would like to respond with "both," but that would be not true.

The non-breaking winch is rusty and in terrible condition. I used the boat six times and took my chances with it. The ramp I use is wide and easy for me to float the boat on and off the trailer, and I suspect not all ramps will be as convenient as the one I have used.

Today, I started sanding the old paint off so I can prime and put two part epoxy paint on it.

Yesterday, I removed the paint off the mast and epoxied seal it ready for priming.

Making the boat better and better.

Fairwinds,
