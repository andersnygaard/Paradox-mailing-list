Hi Bill,

Thank you for uploading those photos! Your unbraked trailer looks like it would work well with my Mondeo. However, I would prefer a braked trailer for better control on slipways and ramps. Al's trailer with the extended rear end and brakes would be ideal, but I unfortunately don't have enough room for something that large at home.

Best regards,
