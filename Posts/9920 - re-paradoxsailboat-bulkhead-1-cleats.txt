I didn't have a table saw, in fact it's unnecessary, although it
would speed things up. You can cut bulkheads by hand, or with a circular
saw, or combination of both. You can put a rough bevel on the cleats,
lifted from the plan, but as they're rolling, you'll need to finish them
with a hand plane anyway during dry assembly.

Ben, I have watched your build videos on YT in Elliotts book he says a
table saw is a necessity but it looks like you cut bulkheads and sides with
a circular saw is that correct?

Do I need a table saw?

You also say you might not have used 18mm for the bottom. What would you
have done different?
Any additional tips are welcome.

Thanks!
