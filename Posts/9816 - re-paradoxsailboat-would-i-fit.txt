It would be OK but you may wish to modify it for sleeping. Could easily modify forward bulkhead. Also raise the cabin top a few inches would help. Not difficult to do.

I am 6 ft 1ins and the unmodified design is fine for me. In fact sleeping would be the only modification you may need.

I have been interested in the Paradox ever since I visited Bill Serjeant a few years ago and saw Faith there. I just wonder if at 6ft 4ins I would fit in one, either headroom sitting upright or would there be room for my 34'' legs?
