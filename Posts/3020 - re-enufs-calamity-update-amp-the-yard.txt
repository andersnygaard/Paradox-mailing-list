For the sail to keep the correct shape the yard needs to be stiffest where it is restrained at the mast If the bamboo is not stiff enough then the corners of the sail will sag and the sail will lose it's shape. The taper on the yard puts the stiffness where it is required while removing material (weight) where it is not needed.
That's my theory, but as a practical engineer I suggest you try the bamboo and see how it works. It would be easy enough to replace if there was a problem, and the data would be useful for future builders

I don't know if the weight of the yard contributes to the docility(?) of an accidental gybe (something I do quite a lot as I tend to pay attention to too many things other than sailing).
