Hi Jeff

I agree that the yuloh is probably a better idea but you did ask about powering the boat from inside. 8^)

Enjoy

Hi Jim.

I had already thought of the Mirage Drive. In fact I have bought two of them(can't think why) from the States. Honestly!
But I think the Yuloh is the best way to go as one can stand up and get a better view.
The trunk for a MD would have to be above the waterline which would mean it would stick up above the cabin sole/floor.
I would not like to sleep with than thing stuck in my back.
It would have to be made water tight as well and have a plug fitted to make the hole flush with the bottom of the boat.
A yuloh is a lot cheaper than a MD as well.

I suspect we have the same weather. It rains frequently here, but not 
in great amounts. I have sometimes, because of the weather, wondered 
if there was a way to propel the boat from inside the cabin. Using 
the legs for power since they are big. A big slow turning propeller 
hung from the transome,(like an outboard motor). But how to link them 
together? Ropes? Hydraulics(with water)? Anything which is not 
greasy/oily. And somthing which can be removed and put away when not 
wanted. It is a hobby of mine to think this way. I have not done well 
on this challenge so far. Noli is interesting name. How did it named 
this?
Cheer, Steve Yahn
