"10,000 miles from the North of Scotland to the South Pacific, in a 21ft Shetland foureen? ....Yes it did have its moments. Pre GPS, email and Weatherfax, and with no engine or electrics, a standing lug rig and flush deck giving maybe 4ft of headroom below, this was truly minimalist sailing. But back in 1973 for my then partner Julie (20) and myself (23), The Aegre was a ticket to a most amazing adventure."

Check out "The Aegre" in the menu bar near the top of the page on http://users.bigpond.net.au/caledonia_yawl/ and sign up for email notifications about new installments at http://users.bigpond.net.au/caledonia_yawl/aegresum.htm.

Sorry for the cross-posting, but I think it is of interest to all and I'm not sure how much overlap there is in the ml members.

The stuff about the caledonia yawl herself is quite interesting too :)
