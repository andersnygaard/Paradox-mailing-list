One thing for sure, the port tack is notably better that the stb one. 
I did not measure it, but I think it's about 60 deg on a stb tack and, may be 45-50 on a port one. Also, I am sure there are sailors who can do better that. Interestingly, she sails like no other boat I've owned (from Sunfish up to 36' keel yacht). It takes some time to get used to. 


Respectfully,
