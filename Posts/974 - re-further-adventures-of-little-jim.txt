Congratulations to Al on the completion of LJ, and the informative log reports from recent outings. The Paradox design appears indeed to have many good points. Could Al comment on the helming position - it crossed my mind that sitting facing forward, but with a lean to either port or starboard could become uncomfortable after a period of time. Is that how it works, do you have to brace yourself against the cockpit sides, or what?

Best wishes for future voyages
