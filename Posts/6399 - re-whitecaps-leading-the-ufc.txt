Nels,

Thanks, I saw that when it was posted but I don't think I had yet been bitten by the "bug". I would be interested to find out how my dislike for tight spaces would respond to this boat. From what I hear about Wizard's size I think the boat needs to come in sizes so I'd need an XL. Now if I were to think up all the "improvements" I'd like to make to this boat I'd be willing to bet I'd end up with a Paradox!
