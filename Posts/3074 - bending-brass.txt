Subject: Bending Brass

Making the tack strop tube while waiting for the epoxy on the mast to set.

I am using 15mm copper water pipe ala Al Law and making a fork from 3mm brass sheet that will be held by a brass compression fitting.

I've cut, shaped and drilled the fork from the sheet. How do I bend the arms at right angles to the base?
An experimental piece fractured along the bend even with warming from a blowlamp.

Do I use heat? Is there a critical temperature at which 3mm brass will bend without fracturing? Would I be better cutting and brazing?
I've not done any brazing for donkeys years, but remember it as very hot soldering in operation.

Help please. I'd like to do this on Wednesday.

Off to make the tack strop cleat now. Busy, busy, busy :0)
