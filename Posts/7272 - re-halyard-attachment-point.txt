Thanks Nels
Yes I've seen the diagram. Unfortunately there are no dimensions for the halyard attachment point position on that sketch. 

From looking at the diagram I would guess that there is about 1 metre from the throat to the halyard, but that's only a rough estimate.

On my new sail, I'll have to make a little hole to allow the the halyard to be tied around the yard. I'd prefer to get this in exactly the right position first time instead of taking the trial and error approach and end up with lots of redundant holes ...

Have you seen Matt's diagram that is in the files section?

The halyard fixing point seems to be a bit further aft than on the old sail. Looks like about 1/3rd the way up the yard. Hopefully somebody else can confirm. I think each sail has to be fine-tuned a bit, maybe several inches either way, depending on how heavy and how much flex in the yard.

Just finalising  my new Mk2 sail and I'm not sure exactly how far back from the throat to fix the halyard.
Anyone have this measurement for the new type sail?

Best
