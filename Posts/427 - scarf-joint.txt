Subject: Scarf joint?

On drawing #6, there's a scarf joint specified just forward of bulkhead #3. Does this need to actually be scarfed, or can I get away with just using a butt block? It looks like the butt would be hidden behind the flotation/insulation foam....

(and a hypothetical bottom butt would be hidden in the storage compartments or water tank)
