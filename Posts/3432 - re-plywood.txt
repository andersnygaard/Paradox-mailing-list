Hi Derek,

Seems like you and I have similar ways of doing things. I'm nearing the end of my first boat build, a modified brat dinghy shown on the boatdesign files. Epoxy has been my main expense, I too have been liberal with its application - I've glassed the bottom and all joins have decent sized fillets.

Other costs in a build can relate to building space - you may have to rent somewhere suitable, or build a shelter. Heating - epoxy application ideally needs to be done above about 12 degrees. Most essential of all, everything needs to be as dry as possible.

You may need to buy tools you do not already possess, or replace those you do. 

Regarding all the marine ply v exterior, house paint v marine paint, cheap v expensive arguments, I really can't comment. Everyone seems to have a point of view and a string of "facts" to back them up. Care and maintenance are what I consider important, and an understanding of the materials you are using.

Fiberglass boats may last longer than wood, but again appearances can be deceptive. Many older boats, though strongly built, have encapsulated wood in their structure. Moisture gets in and rots it. Replacing it is an awful job. Last summer, I was on a 30+ft yacht of a popular French manufacture. When the sun shone on the side, you could see the water line from the inside! A couple of my mates work building fiberglass boats - it's a horrible job and, let's say, pride in workmanship is not a concept widespread in the industry.

Our popular writers don't help much. Robb White hates plywood - says marine ply is an oxymoron. Tom Firth Jones says ply is the best boatbuilding material. Both are experienced commercial builders as well as excellent writers.

In the end, I think we must just make a choice and go for it.

Cheers,
Neil.
