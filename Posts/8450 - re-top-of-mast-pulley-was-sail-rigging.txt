Dear Paradox Builders,

I've agonized over this for ages. Here's what I'm doing/done. I've cut the slot as per the plans, but instead of mounting the light on top of the slot, I'm going to leave it open. My masthead light is a homemade LED strip, and I'm mounting that on the side of the mast using an extra-long bolt, which does double duty as both the block bearing and the lighting mount. The idea is that when I'm at anchor, I can remove the halyard and have a peaceful sleep. Of course, the downside might be that the halyard jumps out of the slot while sailing, but I'm hoping that the reefing tension will prevent that while underway. Still, this idea might have problems at reefing time when tensions aren't very high.

Cheers,
Rob.
