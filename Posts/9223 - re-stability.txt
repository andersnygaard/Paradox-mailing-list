This is an entertaining read, John! Humour is great fun.

But.., a Paradox is so small, I think as soon as the skipper fell overboard, the weight shift inside the boat, would cause it to turn upwind and probably slow down to 1 knot, not 4 knots, even if the tiller was locked. Also the drag from someone holding onto the rope would be so high, the boat would remain stationary or nearly so.

I have no intention of testing these theories as I don't plan on trailing a rope. When, I'm offshore, I've worn a climbing harness with a rope secured to the boat (problem is, it's very tempting to untie that rope, if you want to do anything quickly). I haven't yet, but I also plan on taking:

1. A bicycle helmet.
2. An EPIRB.
3. VHF radio (which I've not used yet).
4. 2 * cellphone with OpenCPN (chart software) on them (they are also my compass).
5. Still wondering about a tiller pilot.

Cooking is the thing I'm most concerned about. The motion of a Paradox is so severe in any kind of seaway, I don't think I would be able to cook anything. Perhaps I might get away with it, if I stopped sailing and lay ahull.
