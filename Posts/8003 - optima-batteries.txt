Hi All -

Its time for a new battery for my Paradox, I presently have an Optima Blue Top that I purchased about 10 years ago, worked great. I was ready to buy another one until I started reading the reviews on the post 2009 batteries. A few reviews were stating that Johnson Controls moved the operations down to Mexico and the quality of the Optima Batteries has gone down.

Does anybody have any experience with the post 2009 Blue Tops?

Thank you,
David
