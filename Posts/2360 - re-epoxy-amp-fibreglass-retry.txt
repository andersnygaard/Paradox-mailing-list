Hi Dave,

Thanks for the great reply. My limited experience with lightweight cloth has had the 'glass slipping and sliding all over the place with me covered in epoxy up to my elbows putting it back in place. :-) I use 3M 77 adhesive all the time. It will be perfect for holding lightweight cloth in place.

Re: Kevlar   If Kevlar can stop a bullet for a policeman, then it should be perfect for stopping a coral reef or a submerged engine block from piercing your hull.  I like the idea.

Sincerely,
