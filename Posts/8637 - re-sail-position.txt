" My boat sails much better to windward on port tack when the mast is to leeward.I'm sure it's because the luff is better supported."

My boat used to do that , but now with my newer sail, which is much better than the original, both tacks are pretty even.

The newer sail has the luff cut slightly concave, so self supporting without too much stress on the halyard.

I cant see any advantage in having the sail on the starboard side of the mast. I think it would just complicate furling and being able to instantly stow the sail along the side deck - as others have said..   The ease of raising and furling the sail and just letting it flop down onto the side deck when required is one of the basic joys of the boat.
