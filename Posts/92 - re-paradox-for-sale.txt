Hi All;

To the best of my knowledge, it is still for sale. I've been meaning to give Bob a call and see if it has been sold yet, and will do so after I return from Philly on the 21st.

As another note of interest, I launched "Zoe" today and went for a short sail in winds of less than 5 knots by a friend's anemometer. She ghosted along between 2.2 & 3.3 knots by my GPS. I've got to run for now but will post more on her first sail later. I am in love with this little Paradox and had more fun this afternoon than I've had in a while in a sail boat. I'm including a picture of her ghosting up to the dock. As you can see from the picture, she was very light as I only had about 75 lbs of ballast and no water on board. Her stability was still quite good though as I could only pull her over about 45 degrees by standing on the dock and pulling her mast down. She will be a treat when properly ballasted.
