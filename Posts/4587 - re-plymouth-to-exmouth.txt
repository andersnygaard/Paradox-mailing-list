Bill,
That's a great write up; you and Al seem to have had a great trip. 
I'm envious of your trip. Maybe if I pull out all the stops we can 
make it 3 paradoxes to the Scillies next year.

One unanswered question - how did you get your car and trailers from 
St Just to Exmouth? Do you have some sort of transporter system like 
on the Star Ship Enterprise!

I look forward to seeing some photo's of your cruise, and I'd be 
pleased to hear more about your adventurous sailing in those heavy 
conditions. Did you feel disadvantaged relying only on the yuloh?
Was there anytime you wished you'd had a motor?

Progress here on "Johanna" is rather slow at the moment. Although I 
have the hull temporarily screwed together I haven't got round to wet 
assembly yet. I have built a trolley to move the boat around, I've 
fitted the cabin sole, dry fitted the Vent trunk, built a 4foot long 
mast (to check the VT fitting) and had a little lie down on the cabin 
sole to try it for comfort! I was hoping to do more last weekend, 
however, even though I live miles from the water, it decided to pay 
us a visit in the street! If I had the bottom fitted I could have 
pushed the boat out onto the road in front of my house and sailed off 
down the road.
As our water has now been cut off, I'm now sitting here surrounded by 
buckets and jars of water with the very real possibilty that we may 
lose power at any time, which also means an end to reading these 
groups for a while.
