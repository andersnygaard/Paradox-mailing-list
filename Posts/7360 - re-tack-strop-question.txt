Ok so I am working on the tack strop system....and I am not totally clear here ....I see the line inside the bottom tube....and the line goes into the vent box to a cleat?  

Yes

So...is the end of the bottom tube just floating on the line and pushing against the deck? Seems like it would gouge....

Yes. When the sail is fully hoist the strop is in tension so there is no problem. When reefed the strop is in compression, taking some of 
the weight of the boom, but not all. 

I reinforced the deck with a glass/epoxy patch and belled out the end of the pipe. The paint has scratched off on the deck but the patch has prevented any significant wear (after 10 years). 

My biggest problem in this area was the chafing of the rope, after a couple of years, where the bending takes place. I fixed this by using a thinner rope with some plastic tube sleeved over it. No problem since.

Question: is anyone using the retaining screw through the boom into the groove in the axle? I fitted this feature but now don't bother with it as the boom shows no inclination to come off the axle.
