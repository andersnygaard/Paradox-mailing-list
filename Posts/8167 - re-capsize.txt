The rudder is cantilevered from the rudder stock and unsupported for most of the underwater part. Which is not a problem when used as designed. Many other boats have unsupported rudders and they aren't having a problem .

But the Paradox rudder carries more load than most other types and when conditions become extreme that load increases, so it and its fixings need to be stronger than most others.

Best,
