Hi Deric,

It was laminated as per the plans, but I used NZ white pine (kahikitea), which I've subsequently learned is not a good wood for boat building as it warps like crazy. The original curve I built into the yuloh disappeared and it reverted to a straight shaft.

I've decided not to build another yuloh.  Instead I'm going to repair the broken one and use it as a conventional paddle, albeit a very long one.  Because a Paradox is narrow, I was able to easily paddle on one side after another with long deep pulls which gave my whole body a proper workout rather than just my upper arm, standing in the middle of the boat against the forward edge of the hatch.  I made quicker progress and felt in better shape afterwards than I ever did with the yuloh.  Being shorter, the paddle is much easier to manipulate than the yuloh and easier to use for fending and driving down into the mud to hold the boat when necessary.

In short for the kind of sailing I do, I think a conventional oar is better for me.

Cheers,

Rob.
