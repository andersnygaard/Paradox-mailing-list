Subject: Re: Paradox windvane steering

I'm not sure if Glen is back from his trip because he visited Cedar Key as part of a longer cruise. Incidentally, I saw ZOE's windvane, but it was damaged by the main sheet before I got to see it in action. I was told and shown how it was suppose to work, and it is quite ingeniuous and lightweight. When he gets home he'll fix the damage and he's already worked out a simple remedy to prevent the sheet from fouling it. By the way, I've already posted a few pictures on another forum and our own website, but I should have fresh ones to post here when I download my wife's camera tonight. For those of you who haven't seen Glen's wonderful sharpie, she truely is a work of art. Luckily, we arrived a few days before the event started so we got to sail and cruise in his company. Hopefully, next year we'll get to see a few more of you in your own Paradox micro-cruisers.

P.S. We'll post our pictures in the Photos section under Cedar Key 2007
