Hi Mike,

This is a bit hopeless. Used to be able to send an email directly to a group member, but it seems Yahoo has taken that functionality away... to stop spammers no doubt, so fair enough.  At the risk of irritating the other Group members, Mike, if you Google "Rob Kellock creditscore" you'll find my email address easily enough. I live in Christchurch.

Didn't realise you still owned "Petite Lady", Peter.  I came and looked her over not long after you bought her from Hugh Miller - I don't think you'd even had a chance to have her on the water. My original intention back then was to buy her off Hugh, but I wasn't quick enough!

Not to worry, building Mini now.

Cheers,

Rob.
