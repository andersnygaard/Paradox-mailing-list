Glen, what a clever and simple idea!

I have an Autohelm out in the shed, and I plan to use a steering line
system on my little cat, so I will definitely duplicate your setup.  I
hate to carry the weight of a wetcell battery, but I require a
fishfinder.  There are some small motorcycle batteries that don't
weigh quite as much as a car battery; they won't run the Autohelm for
very long, but I'll only need it occasionally and briefly.

The rolling hitches would, I think, also make for a simple tiller lock
on a steering line system.


The big brown knob in the second picture is an even simpler tiller 
lock system. Just drop the rope in and screw up the knob to clamp it. 
yank the rope up to release it quickly.

Hoping for calm nights
