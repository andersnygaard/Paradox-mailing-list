Hi,

It all depends what you are doing with your boat! 
As a weekender, day-sailor, go with one batteries !
For a guy like me, my Expeditions go from 2-9 month, I cant get enough of batteries !
Normally I carry a 12v 12 amp sealed gel cell batterie in my folding kayak. On my catamaran I carry at least a 100amp gel  batterie. So on my paradox it will be a s much batteries as I can fit in the boat instead the lead. Lead is just dead weight, batteries are dead weight  with energy.
As charging, it all depend where are you traveling, for me it is in the last 25 years Alaska, the Yukon and the NWT. So there you have close to 24 hr of  light ( in the Summer). So I use a 45 Watt solar panel. On my Paradox there will be a solar as big as possible and one panel which you can roll with 100 Watts that I can use when I am not on the go to extra charge the batteries.
Believe me that is a hole lot of charging power in that region !
I even use on my folding Kayaks a fishinder, 2 GPS, Iridium Sat Phone, a NOAA Weather Sat-Station, a Ham Radio and I charge all my Camera gear with it, and all that with 12v 12amps and a solar panel.
As you see it all depends of what you are doing with your boat. 
I think a little generator (as mention before) is  absolutely no gimmick and would be of very good use, at least for me !
And my carbon footprint is an my journeys much, much better as at home....
