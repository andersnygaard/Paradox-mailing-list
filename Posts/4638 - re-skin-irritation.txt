Hi Ian &al

You could try Vinylester instead of Epoxy. It is much less sensitising although you should still follow all the precautions just in case. Vinyl does have the drawback that it has a very strong odour which many find very unpleasant.

I just returned from a workshop run by Derek Kelsall on composite construction using VE over foam and vacuum infusion which produces flat panels which can be easily bent into shape after they've been cured. His techniques are amazing, producing completely fair panels very quickly and neatly. For anyone who's worked with glass but hasen't seen resin infusion, the process is Magic!

I'm trying to work out whether it would pay to build a Paradox in foam/glass just for the challenge and practice. I'll keep you (all) informed as and when I make any progress.

Enjoy

They said, get a life. I looked on TradeMe but I couldn't find one.
