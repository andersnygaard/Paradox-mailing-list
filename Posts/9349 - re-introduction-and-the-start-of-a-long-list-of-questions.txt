YES , it slaps and slows a lot , plenty of energy goes into steering away from the worst of the waves in a headwind .
It=E2=80=99s a pain in short sharp chop especially if you need to tack into the wind
It=E2=80=99s better to anchor and wait it out , or , as I do , motor .

I was in a narrow channel by an island 6 miles off shore , the current and a headwind had me going nowhere for so long , a fishermen who was watching this for an hour or more called the sea rescue for me to be towed
It was an usual day though
Reefing the sail just the right amount ,  to keep it away from my mast head helped too , it was getting sucked into an S shape around the mast , I made a round tapered hollow mast , or rather a shipwrights made it I glued and sanded and varnished it .
The sail in big headwinds , set full , can S bend and partially reefed that goes away and if fills and billows again .
There are as you will discover a hundred tricks to a lug sail .

Having said that
The main sheet can be just about anywhere within a 35 degree angle of best position , if there is such a thing as the net position , and still the boat has drive .
The flat bottom is more an impediment than the bluff bow .
Keep the bow buried both in rough water and when tacking
Keep an oar handy when going about in light air too
And three or four strokes keeps the boat from getting caught in irons .
