That is true - but the lighter the wind - the less the weathercocking effect. Bolger mentions this several times regarding sharpies. Since they are light displacement they have little momentum so are easily stopped, when tacking. 

Also with the relatively larger rudder area, the tendency can be to apply too much rudder in an effort to get through the eye of the wind before the boat stops moving, and the rudder becomes a brake. So the trick is to try to use as little rudder as possible to carve your turn into the wind and keep way. If you begin to slow down too much, then fall off until you can gather more way and they try again. The other option is to kick the stern over with an oar stroke or two.

Good luck, Nels
