Subject: Re: water tight boot on the Paradox tiller arm

Wow Robert. Your speculation just keeps coming!

Count me as one who sees absolutely no problem with the design of the vent baffle and transom. That, while I do see many problems with an ocean proof cloth tiller boot, series drogue deployment, and vent installation on the after deck. 

I'm sure that you must have many more Paradox design deficiency observations, and I for one would love to read them. It is a rare man indeed, who answers all of his own questions, and I feel privileged to be a witness.

When do you begin construction?
