Hello,

Recently a bad hail storm hit my home near Dallas. My Paradox (that I am building) was outside with just a plastic tarp covering it. Both of our cars were parked outside not far from the boat and they were totaled. All houses near me, even mine, had softball size hail go through the roof, and many windows were broken from hail. 

I thought for sure my Paradox would have been a complete loss because you could see all the large holes in the tarp. It took me a couple of days before I could bring myself to remove the tarp because I didn't want to see how bad the boat was damaged. There were many other things that had to be done because of the damage to our house. But when I removed the tarp, there was only one place that needs repair. I was impressed at how little damage my boat had received considering the situation. 

If someone could help me, I need some advice on how to repair this damage. I posted a picture of the outside and inside of the damaged area. 

Thank you,
William Nix
