To add to what David and Bill have said, I considered leaving the stbd panel removable but in the end glued it on. If I had left it I would have sealed it with the same stuff I used on the windows.

I have never felt the need to remove it, but if I did it would be easy enough to cut an access panel in it.

OK,
Thanks everyone, the deed has been done....
I've decided on an access hatch and I'm happy with it at the moment.
I'll try pouring a few buckets of water in once the epoxy has cured properly just to test for leakage.

Just need to drill and tap holes for 5mm SS bolts.

Thanks
