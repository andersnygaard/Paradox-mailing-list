Happy to do so (as a longtime lurker).

Hi Everyone, 

We are approaching our second anniversary since moving to Groups.io from the now defunct Yahoo Groups. 

Groups.io does charge us for use of this platform. Our membership numbers and our file storage are both too large for the free membership option. 

The charge is $20/month or $220/year. (USD) 

Earlier this year (I only discovered it this week) Groups.io added a 'Sponsorship' feature which allows any member to chip in some funds ($5 minimum) towards the cost of hosting the group. I have now enabled this feature. 

If you are willing to contribute to the Paradox Sailboat group's hosting charges, please go to the home page and click the green "Sponsor This Group" button. 

There's absolutely no pressure to do so. Anyone interested in the Paradox sailboat is always welcome. If you can chip in, though, and it doesn't impact your finances in these admittedly worse-than-before times, please do. 

I paid a one-year renewal in October 2020. I am happy to do this again now, though I don't have any "skin in the game" so to speak, not owing a Paradox. This group and our information resource is valuable and worth preserving. I will cover any shortfall and the group will stay. 

Many thanks, and happy sailing (or dreaming!), 

Matt
