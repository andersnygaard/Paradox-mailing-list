Subject: Re: Whats the strongest winds ?

Difficult question to answer Todd, I know Matt has sailed "Paradox" in winds over 30 kts and there are pictures on Dave & Mindy's web site of him sailing with Chris Morejohn and Mindy aboard in the Exuma Sound in winds over 20 (I think Dave said they were closer to 30). So, based on the fact that she is still being sailed and has always made it to her destinations, she can handle weather and seas. Can any boat really sail into the wind and seas in the roughest conditions easily? My experience sailing to windward in heavy weather has always been rough on crew and boat alike no matter what I was sailing. I don't think I have encountered anything in Zoe like Al has in Little Jim. You can read about his adventures at his web site (check links). Hope this helps.
