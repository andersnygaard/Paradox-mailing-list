I support the effort to enlarge Matt's original design (with his 
apparent, tacit blessing) but I don't think the use of steel is 
appropriate at these sizes even with the scaled stretch. The weight 
additions throughout the design would preclude another look at weight 
distribution, displacement and ultimate stability.

Still, if you could get Matt on board, you might have a really tough, 
coastal cruising, world beater on your hands in the end. That, alone, would be worth the effort.
