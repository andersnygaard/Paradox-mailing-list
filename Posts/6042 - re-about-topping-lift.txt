Subject: Re: About Topping Lift

Hi,Al,

Thank you so much for your response.
I used the same as your's way on my "Auspice",and I mark the rope a
suitable position for the boom be lifted. Another Q's:I put an
outboard on my "Auspice",but it always be interfere with rope when
sailing,do you have same problem?

Best regards,

I don't have an outboard on Little Jim. I can't see any way to mount 
one that would not be a problem with the ropes. I have observed that 
those who do have outboards tend to lower sail and start the motor as 
soon as they need to start tacking. This would help with the problem.

I do have an electric trolling motor which I store inboard. I can 
mount it on a bracket alongside the seat where it is clear of all 
ropes. It is ok in flat water but if the boat leans over the prop 
comes out of the water.

I find the yuloh is generally sufficient.

Hoping for calm nights
