Subject: Re: Sheer clamps and bulkhead #1.

I interpreted the drawings differently. I believe that the cut-outs shown on sheet 3 are 'removed for clarity' as is the deck, so that the detail underneath is visible. On the top view on sheet 3 and on sheet 4 (in hidden detail) the chine logs are shown as continuous.

In practice I doubt if it matters whether it is or not. The whole structure is so sturdy that it will have little effect.

I would be very wary of having no opening through bulkhead 1. My experience of 'sealed buoyancy' is that water gets in and then can't get out because it is sealed. In my case I also need access to the nuts for the cleats and the bow ring. A proper sealed access hatch would be a good compromise, sealed while sailing but opened to carry the spars.

Hoping for calm nights
