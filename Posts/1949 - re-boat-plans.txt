 Hi Shane.

You could always paste a message on microcruising@yahoogroups.com asking Dave or Mindy to give you details on ordering the plans. If you are not a member of that group go to http://www.microcruising.com look up links and click on microcruising then join. As this is Dave and Mindy's site the should read your message. I cant get their email to work as well.

Help requested...
I live in Australia and I am keen to buy a set of Paradox plans. I've tried twice to email Dave Bolduc at microcruising.com without reply. Maybe Dave's spamstopper is causing me grief. Is there some other way to make contact?
TIA
