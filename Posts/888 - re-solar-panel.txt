Oh yeah, I forgot to mention that Matt's new oar also had a wider and longer blade which added to it's effeciveness.  When I get my film developed I'll show everyone a picture of it.

You should be able to scull at about 1.5 to 2 knots once you get the hang of it.  We were able to do this in Little Cruiser during our Bahamas trips this year. By the way the fastest average speed for 1 mile that we were able to scull was around 2.5 knots.  In a short sprint we could do 3.0 knots sometimes... 

When we visited Matt this Spring I got to scull Paradox around for a while.  Also, I took the opportunity to have Matt give me some pointers on how to improve my sculling technique.  One of the things he emphasized was putting your whole body into the stroke. Incidently, Paradox had a new sculling oar which was straighter than the one shown in the plans.  I found this oar was more powerful than the earlier design since you could control the pitch of the blade more easily.  However, it required a great deal more wrist action to scull, and after a bit my right wrist started hurting. Matt also said that his wrist hurt the first few days of the Everglades Challenge while using the new oar.  For this reason, I have to admit that I prefer Little Cruiser's sculling oar which is much more curved than Paradox'oars.

Im also considering sailing without an outboard and was wondering how fast could Paradox be propelled using the Yuloh ? (must stay out of the way of comercial traffic on the rivers I sail) Whisper did not come with one. (Next project) Any Info will be helpfull.
