Subject: Update on ENDEAVOUR
Date: Fri, 29 Jul 2011 11:04:29 -0000


I have an idea I want to share with forum and hopefully get some feedback on.

I mentioned in my last post that ENDEAVOUR was "bulkhead ready"...they were all sealed, faired, painted, and so on.  While I was looking at them all laid out in their approximate station locations, I had an idea that has caused me two (2) sleepless nights thus far.

I have been on the hunt for something I could do or change on my PARADOX to set it apart from the others...I didn't want to justmake another "cookie cutter" boat. So here is what I propose....

On bulkhead #2, the big bad boy with the forward "stateroom" hatch and the beloved vent trunk...I'm thinking of changing it so I can incorporate a tabernacle for my mast instead of basically a step with a cabinet around it.  I want to take out the vent trunk and build basically a square hollow column from bootom of the bulkhead to the top which would be deck height.  All sail controll lines could still come in through this just like on the vent trunk, and basically I would have the same set up just all in a vertical arrangement instead of an angle type set up the plans call for.

I also want to ust two (2) small dorade vents on port and starboard at the fron corners of the cabin area to pump in fresh air while underway.

So if anybody wants to offer advice or tell me why this wouldn't work, I would appreciate it very much....

In the meantime....Safe Passages To All,
