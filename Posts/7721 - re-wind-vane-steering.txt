It worked well after I got the bugs worked out. All the documentation for it was aboard Zoe when she was destroyed in a fire in the trailer she was being delivered to the new owner in. A very sad day for me as well as for the new owner.

Looking through the files I see pictures of the Paradox Zoe set up for wind vane steering. Does anyone know how well it worked out? Thanks Tom
