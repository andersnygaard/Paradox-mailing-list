I recently installed my sail and am having some issues with reefing and furling the sail. When I raise the sail the leading edge or Luff pulls tight, the yard drops at the rear and the Leach has slack. This can be corrected by manually pushing the boom forward. The sail can be fully raised and all appears good except the tack strop spacer is pushed forward from the mast and is not straight up. The boom barely clears the cabin top in the front and the rear of the boom is angled up.

When I try to lower the sail the yard drops at the rear (peak) and the forward (Luff) stays tight so I am not able to spool the reefing line and roll the sail onto the boom. When I lower the sail enough to have enough slack in the Luff the tack strop spacer is very forward of the mast and the boom is resting on the cabin top at this point I tried manually rolling the sail back onto the boom and it rolls tight at the Luff but is loose at the leach. This all appears to do with the action of the Yard. I see pictures of some boats with a third line coming into the cabin that appears to attach to the boom ends. How does this function ? Also when I look at Gaff rigging on line I see the Yard being attached to the halyard by a line running from the Peak to the Throat.

Any help to speed up my education would be kindly appreciated. I have never sailed and am a novice with all the terms and practices.
