Hi,

Try to avoid areas where old piers or bridge pilings may be just below the surface. Especially if the waves get up. Rocks are friendly compared to this stuff. Also sometimes where rip rap has been deposited down the bank to counteract erosion. (This may be more the case along rivers.)

One "problem" with a boat with shallow draft like Paradox is you might be tempted to go into places boats have never been before, just for the heck of it. And there could be junk just below the surface that could damage the hull.
