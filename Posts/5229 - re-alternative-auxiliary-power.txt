I could never do the sort of things I do without the Honda 2.3. Take 
yesterday as an example on the Blackwater.  Wind was from the east at 
force 4; the flood tide was from the same direction and I wanted to 
make two miles to windward as far as Bradwell Power Station before 
running back to Osea Island for circumnavigating it, then return to 
my mooring to the east of the Island by high water.  The engine made 
that possible and a pleasurable experience. Without it, quite 
frankly, any sailing would have been out of the question, because 
within the time frame of a drying mooring I could not have left the 
mooring, simply because the combination of tide and wind would have 
taken me westards towards Maldon where I would have remained until 
the ebb would have helped me return against the wind, but by then I 
may not have got back to my mooring before it had dried!

The engine therefore provides me with options that I would not have 
without it.  Additionally when Paradox finds herself amongst moored 
boats or constricted water when the wind is force 3 or more she 
cannot easily be handled without an engine.  Under those conditions a 
yuloh is virtually useless.

The safety factor of an engine is well worth having, and as Nels has 
pointed out, a Paradox with one can even tow another Paradox!
