Subject: Yrvind

If you've been following Sven Yrvinds latest build you will see that he has just been adding the CRs on his new boat. (If you haven't been following his build, why not?)

The boat is coming on great but I'm not sure whether he is building it smaller that it was originally designed.
I know he now refers to it as Yrvind 1/2 and the forms were all shown cut down to size, but it stilll looks to be similar to his original drawings. can anyone make out what he is doing? 

Anyway, there are a few pictures of Paradox, Enigma and Matt that I haven't seen before. The whole Yvrind site is worth a visit. his Life texts will keep you busy for hours reading. An incredible life story.
