Hi Bill,

Thank you for that Glen. Sorry to hear about your wife. I hope
you'll be able to sort out the light weather sailing. Running in
light winds has always been a problem for windvane systems. When the
tiller lines of Paradox are tensioned correctly they would contribute
quite a bit of friction which would not help.

I'm edging toward an electronic system because of its simplicity and
light weight, and as I do not intend to undertake long ocean
passages, topping up the batteries should not be a problem.

Nevertheless, if you perfect you windvane gear I would be tempted to
copy it.

Hi Glen,

Are you around, or have you gone off sailing with your self-steering
gear?

I've been looking at various windvane gears with a view to adapting
one to Paradox. The easiest would be a Vectavane and Mr Vane would
be another possibility.

Are you completely happy with your gear, and have you been able to
find time for working on drawings of your windvane system?

While on the topic of self-steering systems, what type of electronic
gear did you use and was it linked to the tiller or to the steering
line?

Best wishes,
Bill.
