Don't bother too much about this. Leave the timber a little proud of the bulkhead. It doesn't really matter how much (make a guess by measuring off the plans). If you leave too much you plane it off later, too little and you end up filling the gap with thickened epoxy (get it *really* wrong and you can glue on an extra strip of wood).

The final shape of the bevels is determined during the trial fit. At each critical stage the bits are assembled without glue and adjusted to fit. It is easy to get the angles right then. This assembly method doesn't allow you to get it wrong.

I made the mistake of trying to cut the bevels when I made the bulkheads. None of them were right on the trial assembly, still I console myself that thickened epoxy is stronger than the wood so I have really made the boat stronger :->
