Dear friends,

I have a new boatbuilding method that uses composite materials in a very different way. I use urethane foam, which is very inexpensive and easy to work with. The method is frameless and very fast, which can save a lot of time, and you obtain an ultralight hull. 

I would like to share this method with your group. You can see my method on my website at www.magallanesboatbuilding.com.

Best regards,
Antonio Bordeu.
