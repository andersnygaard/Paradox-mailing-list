I think I would go with scarfing the edges rather than the whole sheet. In fact I wouldn't even scarf it because you are going to have to build up the area with timber to shape the chine runners so a butt block type of addition would be fine. Because the pieces are going to be so small they should not offer much resistance to bending even if they were edge glued to the main piece. You might want to screw a piece of 1/4" ply across the joint until you can get some timber on the top portion after it is installed. Then you could remove the 1/4" ply for final finishing of the bottom. Hope this helps. Glen
