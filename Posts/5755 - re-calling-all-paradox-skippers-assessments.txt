Subject: Re: Calling all Paradox skippers: assessments?

Hi jmichalsbrown,

I'm slightly confused by your posting.

Firstly you say that there are a lot of skippers out there?
Well are there? What we know from this forum, is that there are about 
30 boats in some state of construction. Out of those we know of 
approx 12 which have been finished. Now obviously not every builder 
has frequented this forum, but I'd hazard a guess that there are less 
than 20 complete vessels afloat worldwide. Is that a lot of skippers?

Of the vessels that we KNOW are afloat most, still belong to their 
original owners and they appear happy with them. I'm not sure 
therefore where the under-represented, dissatisfied owners are. Is 
this something you know about or just made up?

If you read the forum history and surf around the web a bit you will 
find lots of info from owners on their experiences of Paradox and 
their customisation.

To start you off why not try the following:

Search the forum and you'll find info from most of the other owners.
