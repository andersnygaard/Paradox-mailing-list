Hello,

If it helps at all, I have a couple of Blogger sites - one for a motorcycle club and the other for myself. Apart from being the right price, the recent versions of Blogger allow static pages, which allow ready accessibility like a website with the usual scrolling list of posts. Comments can be made against posts as desired.

A couple of third party additions ensure that a membership list is emailed whenever a new post is made. A similar third party tool, like dlvr.it, can forward a link to Facebook if wished - keeping all members "in the loop" regardless of their use of Facebook. Because Blogger is a Google offering, the calendar and Google Drive are also available. There's some 15gig available, and as I created the motorcycle blog using a generic Gmail address, it can be readily passed to the next Admin.

The Admin can also allow a number of "Authors". Happy to discuss - FYI in case other options are not satisfactory.

Cheers,
Gary Mac
