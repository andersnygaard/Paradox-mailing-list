It can be relatively comfortable in the cold weather, but in the winter the wind is usually the deciding factor. If I lived on the coast I would probably go out quite often, but being 2 hours away I need to be sure that it will be ok before I start out. A couple of winters ago I tried to extend my season and found myself, on a couple of occasions, in conditions that were not at all relaxing.

So now I spend the winter earning some money so that I can have a summer holiday (all summer). The plan is to stop work, and start sailing, in April.

As to standing in a shower, no Paradox owner would put up with that!

Hoping for calm nights
