Subject: Re: Considering Having Paradox Built for Me.

If the CNC kit only consisted of the bulkheads, sides, bottom and deck, I reckon it would have cut my build time by about a week! Those really are the easy parts of the build. It's the hundreds of little bits that need manufacturing and fitting that take the time, not to mention finishing and painting!
