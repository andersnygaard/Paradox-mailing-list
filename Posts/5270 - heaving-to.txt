Subject: Heaving to

Has anyone tried to heave to in a Paradox? Im sorry if this is a dumb question as I am new to sailing. I got my plans a few weeks a go and as soon as they arrived I tore into them and have been busy learning about it. Wow... what a project... I cant wait to get started. Anyway I take Sailing classes in the fall at ASA but I have already went to the library and picked up "Chapman Seamanship and small boat handling" as well as "learn to sail in a weekend". I picked up a paid copy of Virtual Sailor 7.01 and while I know it wont give me anything close to a real experience I can learn the basics well enough. It actually is a good program as I noticed your point of view on a boat is also a ballast, like in real life. 

So... has anyone heaved to in a paradox and how is it done? I only know about using a jib to do so and Paradox has none. Also .. anyone of u more tech savy guys wanta build me a Paradox I can use in Virtual Sailor? heh.... 

Thanx for your help
