Subject: Fear of Sailing

Exhilaration and Fear travel hand in hand when out on the water, and it can be a fine line that differentiates one from the other. Fear of sailing can also manifest itself as the inability to climb out of one's chair and act on a dream, or unwillingness to cast off just when the dream can become reality because another "chore" must be completed. Here is a new group on Yahoo! that hopes to begin a discussion about the Fear of Sailing.
