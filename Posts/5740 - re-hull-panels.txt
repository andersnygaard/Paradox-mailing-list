An interesting discussion, this! All I can say at this point in time 
is that either he lives alone or has a very understanding wife to 
allow all that lot on the lounge carpet!

Come-on Phil.
I thought everyone does their scarfing on the lounge carpet.
It's nice and warm and you could watch the TV while working plus 
you won't have to shout so loud for a cup of coffee and a sticky bun.
 
WHAT? :-0

I concur with the other who say that scarfing, for the complete 
novice(me)is a somewhat intimidating process. I remember the feeling 
of impending doom as I took my plane to the side panel scarfs. It 
was only once I got started that I realised that "this ain't half has hard as it 
looks". By the time I'd finished the sides the bottom panel presented 
me with no challenge at all (other than being one tough cookie to 
plane)

As Matt says in his Enigma build pages 
"After doing these taped butt joints that everybody says are real 
easy, I confirm my personal belief that glued scarfs are faster, 
easier, cheaper and bend fairer"
