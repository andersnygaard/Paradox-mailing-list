Perhaps Dave Bolduc is away on holiday or your email didn't get through. He comments on this forum sometimes, so you're on the right track and plans are still available through him. I recommend you purchase the PDF version. I bought both and I never look at the hard copy, just print off another A4 PDF when the last one wears out.
