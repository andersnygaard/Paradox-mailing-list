Subject: Re: Gaff Sloop Paradox w/ Bowsprit?

Funny that you guys should bring up a bowsprit...I was checking out a hinged anchor roller system last night. How else can you keep from scratching up the bow when you bring your anchor back aboard? Then I realized that it would increase the LOA of the boat and in some states anything over 14 feet requires registration. At 13' 10" and no engine you need not register a Paradox in Florida, Alabama, and Texas.
