Subject: Re: chine runners

The answer probably depends on how you think the chine runners work, 
some of the theories I have heard operate better with the windward 
runner out of the water.

I personally have two main theories as to the drag (leeward) inducing 
properties, but which, if either, is correct I don't know. If one of 
them is correct then it doesn't matter which location you put them 
in. If the other is correct then they won't work well in either 
position.


Hi guys,

I am designing a waterballasted boat with a box keel.
I'd like to add chine runners and I am wondering where to put them
best: at the chines or at the sides of the boxkeel?
