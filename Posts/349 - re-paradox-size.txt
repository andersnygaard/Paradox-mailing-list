Hi Jeff, Jeff here.
Unfortunately I am not a full time boatbuilder, but I might make my hull drawing available to this group if there was a want, but I would have a problem in what Matt might think, and you would still need to buy a set of PARADOX drawings from Dave and Mindy to complete the boat for the rig etc. As I have said before, I enjoy designing boats for my own use, although I have been commissioned to design for others including workboat manufacturers. I have built to my designs about nine boats so far, including an airboat!
But Matt's PARADOX ------ I wish I had thought of that.
Hey Jeff don't you live in the States where as I live in the UK.
I have in my basement(?) nearly all the wood ready to start building PARAMOUR, which I hope will be April/May'ish depending on my having time, and moving my latest creation out of the way down to my club.

Jeff Please,

I'm also a Jeff! I am interested in your stretched 16' redesign. When do you think you will be finished, and can I get(buy) the finished version? I live in Oregon, an amazing place in the States. I have already purchased the standard Paradox plans, but I am definitely interested in your stretched version. Especially so if it is a stitch and glue design. If you complete the hull panel dimensions, please keep me updated. I have most of the materials to begin construction, but would hold off if I could get a stretched version sometime in the near future. Any information would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you,
Jeff
