Subject: Re: roller furling system/ bronze rod

Before I bent mine I used a lathe to make a groove for the securing screw to ride in. This is a small brass screw that goes thru the boom to the bore(right next to the reefing spool). Then I held the rod in my bench vice (with some soft copper jaws, so as not to make ugly marks in it) then I heated it red hot (at the one spot I wanted it to bend at) with a oxy-acetylene torch and bent it to shape. It bends easily with little force when it is hot enough. I used a piece of pipe over the end as a wrench/handle to bend with. No drama at all.
