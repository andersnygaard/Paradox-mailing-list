DC,
We must think along parallel lines.  One of the things that attacts me to the Paradox is its design feature which PREVENTS you from moving around much.  I've always had problems with my small boats in maintaining sail trim due to the need to move (like everyone else who skippers small boats.)  The Paradox prevents you from encountering this problem.

As far as dealing with the chain / rode, I wonder if you have considered a split forward window?  Let one side hinge outwards so that you can reach through and do some some manhanding on the forward deck without actually going out on it?  If I were to employ a sea anchor on the boat that's how I'd want to deploy it.  It ought to also make dealing with a metal hook easier.

Yes, I'd drain through the mast trunk, but I'd also put a strainer in-line where I could get to it.
