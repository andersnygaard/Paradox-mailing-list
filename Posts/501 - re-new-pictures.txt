Thanks for that. In a few weeks I should have the bottom on and I am then intending to put it on a trailer I built for an inflatable (it should be just within the weight limit) and tout it round a couple of trailer manufacturers to see what they suggest.

I agree that it is best to go over the top on sturdiness.
