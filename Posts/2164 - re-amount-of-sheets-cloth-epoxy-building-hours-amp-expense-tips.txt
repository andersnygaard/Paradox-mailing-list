Hi Matt,

Plywood: 2 off 18mm, 4 off 12mm, 3 off 9mm and 1 off 6mm.

I used marine ply, but significant savings could be made by 
following the suggestion in the plans and using exterior ply. It 
depends on whether cost or longevity are more important.

There is no need to use any glass cloth, but I covered the deck and 
sides with 6oz cloth (about 14 yards)

The bottom is protected with 4mm of woven rovings, though this 
again could be left off if heavy groundings are not expected. (Last 
weekend I made a pigs ear of setting out from an anchorage and 
ended up bouncing on the rocks for a couple of minutes. On 
inspecting the bottom I find that there are a couple of scratches in 
the paint - I am glad I followed the plans.)

I started with 5 gals of epoxy and bought another 5 later on, I still 
have lots left.

I spent about 2500ukp on materials and tools and built over a 
period of about 18 months. It would be possible to build much more 
cheaply and quickly than this. As I say, it depends on your 
priorities.

Have a look at www.asjg.clara.co.uk/little_jim/ for more info.

Best,
Al

Subject: [paradoxbuilders] Amount of sheets, cloth, epoxy? Building Hours &amp; expense tips

Can anybody here give me the scoop on how many plywood sheets, 
yardage of fiberglass cloth, and gallons of epoxy are needed to 
build a Paradox?

I'm sure it says it in the plans... but I don't have a set yet. 

Also, anyone care to share approximately how many hours they spent
building their Paradox? Got any tips for reducing expenses?

Thanks,
Matt Wagner
