Hi All,

I just got through laminating another 1/4 of ply on Whispers sides. I think it went on really well. I epoxy coated both surfaces with straight epoxy and then smotherd it with thicked epoxy (silica) and nailed to bulk heads and logs, and a few dry wall screws in between where there was nothing to nail too. I dont think I have any voids, hard to tell. If I do have a void or two what kind of problems if any will it cause ?

That extra 1/4 inch sure made a difference. Thanks !

David


Thanks, Rick !!

You'll possibly have a small pocket of air, surrounded by epoxy on all sides, surrounded by epoxy saturated plywood, covered by whatever you have over the plywood. Rot spores require food, oxygen and moisture to grow, (the food is the wood) so won't likely ever start there unless you break through the plywood and epoxy. It's too small of a pocket of air for thermal expansion or contraction to bust anything. I doubt you could have created a void large enough to allow the new plywood to flex differently over the void. 

You might be able to find the location of the voids (if any) by looking for a spot or spots of condensation that form repeatedly on the exterior of the painted hull in the mornings when the boat is left outside overnight due to the different thermal characteristics of that area of the hull. (You should also at times see the same thing where the bulkheads or cleats are attached, again, due to thermal differences.)

I feel the less you worry about it the better.

Rick
