Andres,

If you go to link and click on "map" and zoom in a bit you can see the most recent "spot" locations, which show the time and speed of the boat at that time.

Very difficult to find the specs of the various boats though. In the UFC, I think most of the remaining entries are using sea kayaks or more likely a Kruger design canoe, combined with the Balogh BOSS sailing rig.

Going upwind is a bit of challenge with these designs so the guys are putting in long hours of straight ahead paddling, whereas Matt seems to be able to tack upwind better and probably paddle a lot less often.

There are some photos taken before the start at this link and probably more at the link mentioned previously.
