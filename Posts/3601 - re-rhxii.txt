I've contacted you off-list.

I've seen the photos of RHX11 in the photo section and she looks great. It's a sadness that you are unable to finish her.

Best wishes,
Bill. 

Hi,

Would you like me to add your email address to http://www.smallsailboats.co.uk/paradox/names.htm ? This may help you to sell what you've built so far.

Bill.
