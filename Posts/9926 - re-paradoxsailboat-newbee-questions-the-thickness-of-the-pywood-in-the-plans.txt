Barry, you probably saw I am starting my build soon. I also have/had the same question.

I was thinking about building a Tiki 21 (maybe after Paradox) and have the study plans. The Tiki uses 1 x 6mm for the hulls and 1 x 9mm for decks and they are boats that are designed to be beached also like Paradox. I had my first chance to really look over the Paradox plans and it looks VERY well built. Material and techniques have changed since the boat was first designed but I am not a boat designer and hesitate to make any major changes.

One change I might make is to use 12mm ply /glass/Kevlar/glass x 2 on bottom.
