Subject: Re: Scaling paradox plans

If you buy the standard Paradox plans there is a document that details enlarging the paradox.  I think it may also be hiding in the files area.   It says you can go 20 percent larger without issues.

As for Matt and providing larger plans, I just Emailed Matt last week about building his ultimate cruiser.   He had initially returned my Email about the "ultimate cruiser" giving me more information about the design (the "ultimate cruiser" appears to be a 21 foot paradox). When I replied letting him know I wanted to build one ad was looking for additional info I got no response.  I had also offered to pay for some "engineering" time.

My guess is that he would like to offer a larger Paradox in plans. I'm also surmising that he (like most of us) is a busy person and cannot spend all this time he would like to on his "hobby".   He essentially told me as much.

My personal feeling is that one could enlarge the paradox by as much as 33  (or even 50%, giving you the "ultimate cruiser") percent without difficulty.  There are similar sharpie designs out there up to the low 20's.  At the same time, it's always nice to have a design blessed by a designer.
