Where can I get some Lexan in the UK? Is Perspex the same stuff? Are there any alternatives for the Paradox windows?

I got mine from Master Plastics (S.W.) Ltd. <http://www.fascias.com/>
It appears to have cost £160 for a 2.05m x 1.25m x 6mm sheet in 2003.

Hoping for calm nights

Al, Yeovil, England.

The price today is £99.52 (inc VAT) for a 6 mm sheet! Plus postage.

It's not often prices get cheaper.
