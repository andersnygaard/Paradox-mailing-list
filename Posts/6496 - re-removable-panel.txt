Some builders have done this, and it would be interesting to hear their comments.

As far as the "closed box" feeling is concerned, the only time that has occurred to me is when the rain is battering on the roof and I think "thank goodness I am in a closed box that the rain can't get into".

Being able to sit comfortably on deck could be an advantage for chatting to passers by or neighbouring boats, but don't do it while sailing as it would put your head in the flight path of the boom during an unintentional gybe.

It was one of the "improvements" I considered when building Little Jim, but I decided it would be fairly easy to retrofit if I decided it was ultimately desirable. So far I haven't bothered.

Hoping for calm nights
