Hi Pete,

Many thanks for the info. Have been looking at your building blog, very impressed with your progress. Me, I'm a plod, so very unlikely to overtake you.  
I have asked Goldbergs in Uxbridge (sister company of Clarks Wood, I believe) for a quote for the posh Stag marine ply, said they may have to get the 18mm from Clarks in Bristol! Their prices seem to be very competitive compared with Robbins. Enfield Timber, a company I know quite well, have offered the 10 sheets of quote: 'marine ply to BS1088', at £284-03 inc delivery. This looks too good to be true, so I'm going over there shortly to take a look. Suspect it is WBP, but curious to see how many plies and what sort of quality it is, but how you tell if the ply has many voids is beyond me.
Not being an experienced sailor I have a recurring vision at the moment of me in the sea with only 1/2 inch of ply between me and a watery end :)
Bye for now,
Ian L.
