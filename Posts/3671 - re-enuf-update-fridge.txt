I doubt that Owen was insured. I know that he sneaked through the Caledonian Canal without insurance and that the insurance premium for a 29' wooden boat constantly on the move was a bit heavy for his lifestyle.
If the bulk carrier is at fault then I presume he can claim from their cover. Problem is, he has lost not just boat and cat, both replaceable, but the records of his life. He has only memories left.
My experience of trauma is that the shock hits you unexpectedly about a month later.

I've emailed his mother to see if he is home; I'll keep you informed.
