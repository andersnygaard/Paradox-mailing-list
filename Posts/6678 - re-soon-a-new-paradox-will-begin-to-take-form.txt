Hi Stuart,

What part of Michigan are you from?

David,

Paradox "Whisper"



Hello all,

I've been lurking on this group for quite a while, and biding my time while I wait for the stars to align and present me with an opportunity to build a Paradox. It looks like things are finally starting to fall into place.

For X-Mas, my lovely wife gifted me with plans and the builders manual, and while it is still to cold here to build, I will soon begin a model in order to ensure that I understand the build process (something I do on any likely projects before I begin).

Come spring, I am trusting in the kindness of the tax man in providing me with building materials, and focusing on making as big a dent in the project in the three warmer seasons of Michigan.

I am putting the cart before the horse so to speak, but if my schedule allows and the build is done in time, I am hoping that I can attend a couple of 2012 sailing events, most likely the Florida BEER Cruise and Florida 120, and sailing the Great Lakes the rest of the time.

Given that I am a carpenter with boatbuilding experience and that I usually have summers free, money is going to be my biggest hurdle on two fronts. First is the boat materials, and second is that my current tow vehicle won't handle the weight of this boat, let alone its trailer at displacement trim. On the plus side, I've been needing new wheels for a couple of years now, so now I'll have an excuse. Lol.

With that introduction to my next 18 months or so, are there any folks in or around Michigan who are considering building, started, or completed a Paradox? I'd love to get in touch, as I have found that sharing builds and lending a hand with one another when needed provides motivation to keep the build going.

Bye for now,
Stuart
