Subject: Re: Mr Elliot 's Yahoo Legacy

Sorry Wayne,

Don passed away, IIRC in late 08. Don's widow, Wanda, and family, have considered how best to deal with Don's legacy - the boat stuff, that is. For example, Wanda posted a while ago that Don's articles and build manuals would still be available from them. Don's old yahoo groups became jammed with spam. I believe in recent months his son has cleaned much of that up.

A few weeks ago Wanda posted on the groups requesting expressions of interest to be moderators, and gave a deadline about closure if none were received. I know of some submitted, but she has now given some notice that the groups will close in any case. She hasn't the time nor heart, she said, to keep up with things. If you understand the Yahoo groups background workings then you may not be surprised at the decision. To cede power that can be efficient in moderation without ceding control is problematical - so you either give away control not knowing what will ultimately be done and where it might lead (and there are many instances of grief), or you have to keep actively involved (remote involvement can cause grief too. Yahoo has dallied with these complaint issues for a long time - it's complex - see the groupsblog). Wanda has mentioned that a site including Don's stuff may be set up by his family.

When a yahoo group closes - zap - everything is wiped - gone. There may be some posted content worth keeping - posted by Don or others - up to you. I believe the clock now ticking. (I haven't checked for yahoo on the waybackmachine.)
