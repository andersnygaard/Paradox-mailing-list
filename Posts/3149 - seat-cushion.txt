Subject: Seat Cushion

Hi All,

FYI, I just got back from a weekend of sailing, I tried a new seat cushion that worked great !! My Ex works at a home health care facility and they had a demo wheel chair cushion that was riped and was going to be thrown out, My Ex grabbed it for me. It worked, No Butt fatige at all !!! You would not want to buy one, they are expensive Butif you could find a used one I would recommend it.
