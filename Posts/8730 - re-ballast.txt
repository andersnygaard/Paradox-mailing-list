One of the cool things about Matt’s roller furling is that the sail is easily disconnected from the mast and placed on the Cabin top is so desired. A junk is going to need all of the batten parrels released to do the same, so not a quick simple process. Then again, if it’s sitting furled in the lazyjacks, there may be no need. 

I’d think if you had a bunch of low bridges to get under the original rig would make ease striking the mast repeatedly quite important.
