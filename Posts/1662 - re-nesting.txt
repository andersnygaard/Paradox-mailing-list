You know I didn't think of that, the dxf file is for 3D programs I will see if I can't upload a 2D dxf file.

Good job Glen and thanks.  I think more people will find a dfx file easier to work with.

Great link Bill, Thanks! I down loaded "Crossroads" and converted the VRML file to DFX format then imported it into "Intellicad 2000" with no problems. I will post both the Hull file and the 3D DXF file to the files section.

Great program.  I'm glad you mentioned it Glen.  In fact, are you aware that Hulls files can be imported into to AutoCad?  Check out this page because it might make things simpler.

It would also be great if you could put your Paradox offsets into the Files section.  I think many people would benefit from them.
