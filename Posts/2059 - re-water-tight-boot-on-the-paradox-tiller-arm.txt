Subject: Re: water tight boot on the Paradox tiller arm


I have never mentioned that a tiller arm open port is a design deficiency. I addressed the question of using a series sea drogue on Paradox in a very objective way, first with its designer who was not offended by looking at this with me. He has not mentioned to me any of the many problems that you see with a watertight boot, or series sea drogue or on aft deck vent. You are quite welcome to elaborate on this if you would like to ...

Cheers, Robert

If one installs a "permanent" watertight boot on the Paradox tiller arm, then one should install a small dorad or mushroom vent on the aft deck to replace the lost of the open tiller arm port for ventilation. This ventilation on the aft deck should have a watertight heavy weather cover that can be installed for major storms to permit the boat capsizing without flooding by the ventilation system. However, if the water tight boot is a removable installation for storms only, you can retain the tiller arm port opening for fair weather ventilation and you won't require a dorad or mushroom vent on the aft deck. This is the route that I would prefer(to have my cake and eat it too)...
