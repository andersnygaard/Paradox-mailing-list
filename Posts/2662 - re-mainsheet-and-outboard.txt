Subject: Re: Mainsheet and outboard

Hi all,

Took a look at 'Builders and Owners" on Bill's website following Jack's message and found a photo of his Jill Baby that made me realise just how long the boom is. Now I understand the information given about angles and things.

Would it be possible/practical to bring the attachment point for the mainsheet further down the boom to above the rear deck? Doubled pulleys would deal with difference in leverage but is it possible to get a secure attachment to a boom that rolls the sail around itself?

A second thought is to side mount the motor and keep it out of the way of the transom. Has anybody any experienc of this?

Cheers,
Derek
