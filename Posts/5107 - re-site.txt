Hello-

I think I know what you want to do and I think I know how to do it. Go to paradoxboatbuilders@yahoo.com and ask to join that group. There shouldn't be any problem joining the site, but watch out for the moderator, Don Elliott. He's a bit lunatic about keeping on the subject of the Paradox as designed by Matt Layden, with no discussion allowed about any changes at all.
