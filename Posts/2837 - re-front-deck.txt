I'm having a hard time understanding why you would have a problem with the fore deck as it really doesn't have that much camber. Have you faired the area with a batten fore and aft? Try using sheet rock screws and starting from the center screw down one side and then the other working from the center out. I don't recall having any problems what so ever in this area but then I don't know how you are approaching the issue. Fill us in a little more and we will get you there. Keep faith.

Hi all, 

I am having trouble getting the front deck to fit. I can't get it to curve enough. I have cut across bulkhead two and got that bit fixed and am now wondering whether to cut it across bulkhead one as well to end up with three smaller parts. I have tried webbing straps and windlasses but still no luck. I am also thinking about cutting grooves along the length to encourage it to bend. Before I go that route though has anybody any thoughts and ideas?

Cheers  ....  Derek
