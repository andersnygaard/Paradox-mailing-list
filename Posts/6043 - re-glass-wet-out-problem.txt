Subject: Re: Glass wet-out problem

Hello Pete,

I just got done with a big fiber glass project. I did some research before I began and in my reading I found that the fiber glass cloth has a chemical added to it to let it absorb epoxy resin and if that chemical is washed off, say with water, the cloth would no longer absorb the resin. I believe I found this on the West systems web site. And yes, if your cloth didn't wet out, I would cut it out and fill it in with another piece. Good luck.

OK, so today I glassed one side of my Paradox. I reckoned this would be a straightforward job. So far I've glassed the bottom using 600g and 450g biax and have 120g cloth on the deck. All these were a breeze to apply, so you can imagine my dismay when I had real difficulty wetting out the 200g cloth on the topsides. I had to apply a massive amount of pressure with a squeegee (sore wrist now) to get any transparency of the cloth. In 2 or 3 places I could not get it to go transparent at all. The cloth is not floating, it's saturated with epoxy but will not go clear. My dilemma is now what to do. Shall I try and cut out the white areas and try again? Is it possible there is something wrong with the cloth? I bought it from Robbins so should be epoxy compatible. I'm now not looking forward to side number 2!
