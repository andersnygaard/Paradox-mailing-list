Neil,

I was in Esperance not long ago visiting friends. Looking out to the ocean did look rather enticing, but I don't think I'd try to sail that far... (at least not in a paradox) maybe trailer. I have my eye on the abrolhos islands as a potential destination though I'm a bit nervous about heading downwind as there's no guarantee I'd be able to get back. Anyway, if I do that it won't be for some time... I'm all sailed out for the moment.

Cheers,
Geoff.
