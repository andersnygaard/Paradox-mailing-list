Since I decided that a small 4-stroke was the best choice for my needs I have rather lost interest in the electric option.

Here is a link to a yahoo group on that subject:

And I saved this link that seemed interesting at one point:

If you want any "real power" you have to go to a 24v motor at least - which means 4 golf cart batteries and a pretty big solar panel array. The little plastic props on trolling motors are generally considered useless by the techies seriously into moving boats using electricity.

If I had deep pockets I would be looking at developing a small motor sailor using a tiny bio diesel engine - with an 90 amp alternator like I had on my camper van conversion  -  although the motor wasn't bio nor tiny!
