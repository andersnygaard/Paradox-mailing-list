In a nutshell Sven's designs use a sandwich of Divinylcell foam, glass, and
a flexible resin (all Swedish formulations though available in the US see:
http://www.diabgroup.com/ ) which give his hulls some measure of flexibility
when struck.  I don't mean to suggest that the hulls aren't rigid, just that
when struck they can rebound.  He did this for sound engineering purposes-
ever notice how an airliner's wings flex?  This prevents stress from
'localizing'.  Sven also told me he tought it would make the boat better
able to survive running over a sleeping whale.
