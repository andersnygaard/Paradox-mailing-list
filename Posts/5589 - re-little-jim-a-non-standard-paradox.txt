Ok.... thanx Al, it's making more sense to me this morning. Just one more question and this one relates to basic woodworking knowledge .. I guess. Just how did you guys shape the wood for these parts? All I have is hand tools, skilsaw, jigsaw, belt sander and drill are the extent of my powertools. I do have fences for both skilsaw and jigsaw. And an excellent set of chisels. And how do I determine the radius of the rounding of the corners? I mean how do I make the wood round to that measurement?

Sorry to be a pain, (musta skipped these days in woodshop)
