Hi All,

I'm alive and well and apologize for the silence. I've been so busy cleaning up after both storms that I'm behind in my e-mail. All is well here just a lot of blow down and we are also in the process of barn building so I've had to keep my eye on the construction workers, makes for long days. Thanks for every ones concern, I will try to get caught up on my e-mail shortly.
