Subject: Re: Bigger Paradox

Hi,

No problem for me. It can be heavy. It can have more ballast and I won't chance the sail because that will make it go slow. That's the main reason to get a Paradox! I did my homework and I have been thinking about that project for over 3 years now. I still think a Paradox is the best for me and my way of travel! I need that little more space, so it has to be a bit bigger. Constructive answers would be nice. Searching for another boat won't help me much!

Regards,
Chris
