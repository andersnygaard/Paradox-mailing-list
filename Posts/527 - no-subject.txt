Hello,

After 44 years on the water, I would suggest that you also carry a very bright, long range spotlight to shine in the face of any oncoming craft.... If they are out running at high speed at night, you can bet they are either real stupid, real drunk or both.

I can't tell you what else I carry in my boat.

Be well.
