Hi all.

I would use it too. I=E2=80=99m another one with the plans in the draw and dreams in my head. I might be able to help with hosting space for such a small group. I=E2=80=99ll look into it. Currently I pay something like =C2=A35 a year for 10 Wordpress sites and I=E2=80=99m happy to swallow the cost for the paradox site. Count me in.
