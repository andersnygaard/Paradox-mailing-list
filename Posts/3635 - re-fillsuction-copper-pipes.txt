Jim, if you are going along that line, you could use sheet lead with epoxy and sand to keep it put. Make sure the sand is hot dried, then allowed to cool, before mixing in the epoxy. Hot drying the sand removes any moisture.

I'm still considering using the tanks for their original design purpose, that's for a fresh water supply. No final decision yet made.

The lead could be screwed to the bottom, but the mixture of sand and resin will permanently hold it in place. I used this method on my 25 ft Folksong and the sand added weight. It worked well.

Just a suggestion; although if you did try it, the epoxy sure gets hot when curing.

Bill.
