Hi Sean,

I was able to obtain the Plans and the building manual from the sources below - in both cases email was responded to quickly and payment was made by Paypal - both doc sets arrived by email very shortly later - a great service all round.

As suggested if Dave has been slow to reply he  may be off sailing somewhere :-)

 Paradox plans: Dave Bolduc sells and distributes the Paradox Plans.
 He can be contacted by email at: 
 mbolduc@triad.rr.com 
 or by "snail mail" at:
 David Bolduc
 1736 Phillips Avenue
 Greensboro, NC  27405
 U.S.A.
 I believe the plans are still the bargain price of $40 (US). 
 Study Plans are available to peruse here -

 Builders Manual :The late Don Elliot  also produced an excellent "Building Paradox" manual.
 Don's widow, Wanda, is selling his Paradox Boat Building Manual . She will answer all replies as soon as possible and can send all the info you will need to order the Paradox manual either by PDF or as a CD. Her email address is:
 rite2wanda@yahoo.com 
 A sample of the sketches in his manual can be found here -

 As noted  above  - I contacted both David and Wanda earlier this year - they both responded very quickly. Payment was  made by Paypal and the docs were emailed shortly after -  both sets of documents are very much value for money.

Cheers

Gary Mac
