Jeri,

I have to agree with Perry. I have a Paradox " Whisper" that I am willing to trade for a good used "Peep Hen". My Son and I have out grown Whisper. If it asnt for having another Paradox partially built, I would not consider trading

I am not willing to sell her outright just yet. Maybe in the future.

Best Regards,

David Beard
