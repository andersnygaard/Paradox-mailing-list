I too am thinking of just making this area of bilge into normal storage and doing as Dave Bolduc does. Just fill the area with water bottles. No pump needed. I think I've seen square shaped water bottles somewhere. Gin Bottles ?

If you are not going to drink the stuff why not use
sea water for the ballast? 

Less chance of rot forming in the tanks too.

The more I think about it, the more attractive the
idea of not building the tanks and going for just a
bit more lead is. A gain of foot room /headroom too.

I have never timed it, but I suppose it takes about
5 to 10 minutes 
per side to fill from a tap (about twice as long
using the bilge 
pump). I usually set it filling and then sort out
rigging the mast 
and sail. The filling is quicker than the rigging.

I got a couple of deck fittings at a boat jumble,
and made a plug 
that screws in and connects to the pump inlet. 
 
For filling, as the fittings are outside, I just
point the hose 
somewhere near, and any water that doesn't go in the
tank just goes 
over the side.

Beware of forcing the water in too fast. I blew off
one of my 
inspection hatches doing that.

If I was going to do this I would replace with lead
ballast and do 
away with the bother.

On a couple of occasions, in light conditions, I
have left out the 
water, but it has a noticeably effect on the initial
stability.

Neither of my epoxy suppliers (system 3 and
epoxy-resins.co.uk) would 
clear their resin for potable water. Perhaps the
resins have changed 
since my build.

In theory I only have to remove the filler plug and
block the gap in 
the toe rail with a rubber block to permit filling
with rain water. 
In practice I don't see this ever being necessary.
Though I suppose 
if I want to sail in the SE this summer it might be
the only legal 
way to fill with fresh water.  :-(
