Subject: Re: Enuf's Calamity Update &amp; the Yard

Wow! You have viewed the yard as a thin piece of wood thickened where necessary and I have seen it as a thick piece of wood thinned down. I never even thought of it your way about.
The plans suggest that it can be made hollow so the weight is obviously not an issue. I'll try the bamboo and beef it up at the point by the mast.
