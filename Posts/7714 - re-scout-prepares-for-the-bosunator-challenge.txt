Subject: Re: Scout prepares for the Bosunator Challenge

Hi Sean,

The Bosunator Challenge sounds like a great idea, wish I was there with you!

You seem to be having problems with the Yuloh popping out of it's socket.  I had the same problem the first time I tried Ironsides (which I will soon rename, perhaps to Nogaz, like you I'm trying to coerce myself to stay away from a gas engine), but  I did manage to fix it in the following way:

Steve Yahn had drilled holes in the Yuloh and inserted white concave Lexan plugs which matched the steel ball bearing pivot.  The Yuloh kept popping out, and I blamed myself and my inexperience at using it.  But, being an expert canoeist, something just didn't feel right.  I couldn't fathom that the Yuloh had to be held in place by technique, and that it should let go when I relieved downward pressure. Steve had even placed eyelets on each side of the pivot to tie on the Yuloh with a bungee cord.

I called him and asked if he had used plans for the depth of the socket.  Nope, just did it by eye.  Ok, so I figured they should be deeper, and I removed the Lexan plugs and dug the hole an extra half an inch deep, for a total depth of an inch.  This left half an inch or so at the top of the hole which was wider than the ball.  I cut up an inch long piece of hose and glued it into the hole; the hose sticks out half an inch from the Yuloh.

This worked wonderfully, since the Yuloh no longer pops out, in fact I can let it go completely and the blade just floats at the back and the handle stays attached.  Now it works as it should, I feel.  Just push it back and forth, no hassles.  Wish I had photos to show you, but I'm not picking up the boat until the end of November.

Hope this helps.

Really  looking forward to hearing of your forthcoming adventure!
