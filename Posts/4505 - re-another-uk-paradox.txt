Some things to consider in ascertaining plywood quality.

The more layers the better, since poor quality wood does not peel into thin layers without breaking up. Also the more glue lines you will have so the more barriers to moisture transfer.

Make certain all layers are the same thickness. Sometimes thick cheap core veneers are used and the outer skins are higher quality but much thinner and therefore cannot abide much sanding. I would avoid this stuff for boat hulls.

Look for voids at the edges of the sheets.

Also, better plywood is often relatively lighter than the poorer stuff.

Good luck,
