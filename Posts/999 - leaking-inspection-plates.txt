Subject: Leaking inspection plates

Is there a chance that a couple of layers of teflon tape, or a coating 
of teflon paste would help seal these inspection plates?
Also, if a builder was to settle for "workboat" finish, wjat would the 
estimate for hours of construction be for a completed hull?

Best regards,
JimG
