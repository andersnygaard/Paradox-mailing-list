Subject: Re: Epoxy & Fibreglass

Forgive me for a stuid question but why cover all of the boat in glass?

By the way, the simpliest way to apply the 1.7 oz Kevlar and 4 oz glass fabric laminate is to first cut the fabric on the bias. Next spray a light coat of 3M 77 to the edges of the board or rudder. Next lay the Kevlar on the edge without pulling on the fabric since it will stretch very easily out of shape. After the Kevlar, mist the fabric that is on the edge and apply another layer of Kevlar or glass. Stagger the seams. Finally, apply the epoxy with a brush or roller

Hi Dave, Thanks for the rudder and centerboard pics. At the risk of asking a dumb question, doesn't the 3M adhesive interfere with the epoxy bond? Or, did I miss something.

Thanks,
Tom Hathaway
