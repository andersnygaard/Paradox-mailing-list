Hi,

heres how I did my chine runners,

bottom was put on, left a curved shelf to start the chine runners, i cut out cardboard patterns of the shape at different spots, so all I had to do was place the pattern on the boat to see if Ive got enough to shape the parts.... then I made small blocks 3 inches each by one inch or more if needed, and kinda like building a wall i glued them in place to make up the profile needed, then shaped them with a hand plane and sanded the rest , heres the reasoning behind my plan, if they get scuffed moisture will only enter one block, it is incapsulated in epoxy and wont run down the length of the chine runners and ruin the whole thing, they are not really structual, to having wood grain the whole length isnt really that important, shape is the important thing, after they were shaped they were sheathed in 2 oz glass, ive had the boat in use for a few years and no problems at all, and It was very easy to accomplish.

just another way to do it

That sounds like a good plan. It will certainly be much easier to clamp them in position and if you steam them first it will make it even easier.

As you know, I found it impossible to bend the full length pieces into position and ended up cutting them into ~1ft lengths. This appears to have worked ok, but full length strips would be more elegant, not to mention needing less epoxy.

Go for it!
