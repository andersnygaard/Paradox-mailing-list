Thanks again for the update Jim.  Now that it's officially hurricane season, I guess they will have to watch the weather carefully if they want to have a safe passage.  If it were me, I'd rather cross the Atlantic in the Fall and then spend my winter cruising the Caribbean before heading to Florida.
