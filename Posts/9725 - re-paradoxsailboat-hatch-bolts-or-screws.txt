I have done like this: predrilled the screw hole, then drilled the hole bigger near the surface, filled the hole with slightly thickened epoxy, and then put in the screw.

I was taught by a boat builder to overdrill the size of a screw hole . Then back fill the hole with epoxy . To create a plug in the wood . Then redrill the hole to the correct size , that way rot won't start at the holes for fittings . It seems a lot of work , but I'm used to it and doesn't seem an inconvenience now . Screws into a boat will create rot if not done this way . My boat is water tight and rot free several years after launching it .

Here is the deck before and after filling holes with epoxy
I bolted the deck on , removed the bolts when dry and back fill holes
No metal in wood any where on the boat

The reason bolts are always better than screws is in case water eventually finds its way around the bolt or screw (almost always with time unless careful maintenance .  With a bolt, the water drips inside the boat and you know you have a problem which can be fixed easily before the wood rots.  With a screw, the water does not go through, and just sits there inside the wood causing rot, then you have to change the entire piece instead of just resealing the hole. Worse, the screw releases it's hold at the most inopportune moment, Murphy's law.  I have learned to use bolts, as Matt probably did long ago too.

Hope this helps.
