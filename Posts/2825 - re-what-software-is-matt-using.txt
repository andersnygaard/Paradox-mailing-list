Subject: Re: What software is Matt using?

Rhino 3D

The same program I use. It works great for chine or smooth hulled boats and it can accept a set of plugins for full hydrodynamic analysis from RhinoMarine (aka Proteus Engineering who also produce FastShip which is a full-tilt, dedicated, NURBS based, marine design package)

The computer from which these screen grabs originated was not running RhinoMarine.
