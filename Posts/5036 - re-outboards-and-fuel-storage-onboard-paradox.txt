Hello folks,

I'd just like to point out - though I'm sure that you already know - that batteries when being charged up give off highly flamible/explosive Hydrogen gas.

The sensible solution, for boat use, is to pay the extra and get a sealed battery (Gell Cell or AGM). My AGM has no vents at all and claims it can be mounted at any attitude, and will work under water (though I hope never to test that particular claim).

Hoping for calm nights,
Al
Yeovil, England.
