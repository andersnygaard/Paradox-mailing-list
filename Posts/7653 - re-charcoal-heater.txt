Hi Brian

Thanks for the interesting reply. I don't want to sound discouraging, but can only suggest that you get one of the boats that you've already built sailing before starting a new project. Until you've tried it, you won't even know if you'll like sailing, so perhaps best not to spend any more of your resources on more boat building until then.

Good luck to you anyway, whatever course you steer in future..

Best

Jim
