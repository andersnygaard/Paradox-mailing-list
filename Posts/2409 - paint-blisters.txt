Subject: Paint Blisters ???

Hi All,

I just uncovered Whisper for the first time in about 6 weeks, and everywhere the tarp touched I have small blisters. She has a fresh paint job using Interlux Brightsides, What has happened? I have painted several boats using the Brightsides and have never had this to happen. Any clues as to what is going on?
