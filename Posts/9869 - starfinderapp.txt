Hi All,

I am Sybe Starkenburg, Paradox builder (almost completed), live in Montagu, South Africa and am a retired mariner, navigator.

I have created a StarFinder app for Android, a tool for finding stars and calculating a Line of Position. The sun, moon and planets are also included.

Before I can put the app on Google Play I have to test the App before launching.

I am asking for email addresses from those of you willing to participate. Your email address will be used by Google Play for testing purposes only.

My private email address is: sybe.starkenburg@gmail.co.za

I will update you should the testing fail for any reason and should I have to withdraw the App.

Thank you in advance for your interest.

Kind Regards,

Sybe Starkenburg
Montagu
