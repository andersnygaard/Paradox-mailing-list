Hi Al.

I have had a few set backs over the last couple of weeks, weather, work, family, but I am still looking towards the end of July. My trouble is in having been involved with plug making for the marine trade, I decided to add a bit of detail around the deck area and it is taking extra time. Still I think it will be worth it. But mainly lets hope the money and weather hold out. As for leeway. If you sail on one tack, hard on the wind, and take a bearing on the compass. Change tacks and do the same, this will give you a good idea of LITTLE JIM's windward performance. I expect it will be around 40 degree's. Maybe slightly more. I will stick another photo in my folder later now NOLI is upright again.

Hoping for calm nights.
