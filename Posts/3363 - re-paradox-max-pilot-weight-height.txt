Who told you that? And had they ever been near a Paradox?

Look at my web site <URL:http://www.as4jg.freeuk.com/little_jim> and 
click on "Stability". You will find a picture of me (180 pounds) 
trying hard to turn it over. 

The weight is irrelevant as there is a couple of hundred pounds of 
lead ballast that can be removed to compensate.

On my Paradox the clearance between floor and ceiling (sitting 
headroom inside) is 860mm (~34 inches).

Sleeping accommodation as designed is 1.8m (~5' 11") but with 
a minor mod this could be extended by a further 0.8m (~31").

Wayne
