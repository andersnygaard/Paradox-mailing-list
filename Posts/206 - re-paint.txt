Sorry to take so long to reply David, I found this e-mail on my laptop and realized I hadn't answered you. 

Any way, I used a very expensive primer that I had laying around. The primer of course will depend on the type of paint. Having seen your boat, and assuming you want to keep the cost down and get it painted I would suggest using the west SEA GLOSS. Start with a qt. and just do from the sheer to the water line, see how far it goes. Sand it with an orbital sander first to smooth the surface.

I'm afraid that if you use Latex it will make it hard on the next owner to repaint with anything else (if that is important to you). I think the resale value would be greater with the sea gloss.

Hope this helps. 

Glen
