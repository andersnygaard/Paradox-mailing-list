Hi William,

Before you donate this money, I think you need to reconsider. While I appreciate what you're trying to do, I don't think any of us need your money. I would prefer you spend it on yourself! Complete your Paradox, get down to Florida and sail about down there offshore, remembering to report back to us on your experiences. Your local lake is never going to cut it as a place to train for a Bahamas crossing. You need to do some open sea work. After a bit of that you might decide the Bahamas thing isn't for you after all, which is fine. We're not all cut out to be ocean crossers. Or the next time we hear from you, it could be from Panama!

No amount of software is going to be able to stop people from cheating. There's just too many variables that need to be locked down. Even if nobody cheats (I suspect we're all pretty honest on this group), it's still going to be next to impossible to have a level playing field. Weather is the biggest problem. I can't see any way that a handicap system could be developed that accounts for different weather around the globe. But that's just the tip of the iceberg. How do you define a stock Paradox? If the race is going to be over a 24 hour period, anybody who implements self-steering is going to have a significant advantage. Time zones? If the start time is USA time, then that means I have to start in the middle of the night NZ time. That's not fair. But if I delay 12 hours from USA, then I could probably work out whether I had a chance or not and if it looked bad, I'd abandon my entry. I could go on... a triangular course would be needed for upwind sailing, fetch would impact choppiness, salt water vs fresh water performance, etc etc.

Cheers,

Rob.
