Hi,

My name is Jörgen Agardtson and I live outside Våxtorp on the border between Halland and Skåne. I have bought the plans and manual for the Paradox but have not yet started the build. Last summer I finished my first boat, an outrigger sailing canoe by Gary Dierking. This summer Im sailing it and I hope to start on the Paradox build later on. 

How is your build going?

Jörgen
