Hello Rob,

Sorry for the late reply. I know of your Philsboat and think we have similar tastes. I built a Philsboat to the point of finishing the hull, but never actually finished the entire boat. I have since moved into a much better place for my family to live, but no longer have as much room for larger boats. Still, my shop is very nice and I'm looking forward to warmer weather. I have all of the wood purchased and many of the little bits I'll nee to rig and equip the boat but cutting will need to wait most likely until March when freezing temps stop dominating the day.

If I can actually finish building her, I plan to leave for Florida just after Christmas next year and head to the Bahamas for a few months. I'll be taking a retired friend with me and he'll be sailing a smaller version of the Michalak Robbsboat (really an enigma clone). I have a bigish boat in Florida but to tell the truth I think the Paradox like sharpie will be easier to sail and simpler to manage than two hulls, and 8K lbs of wood and equipment.

Good luck with your build. It should be summer where you are so no excuses about the cold, etc. Don't let work impede you, there will always be work to do so don't worry about that. Keep in touch and fair winds.
