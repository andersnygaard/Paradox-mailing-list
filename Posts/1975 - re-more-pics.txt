at first I planned a stainless steel sheet for the bottom, also serving as a part of the ballast. Now I'm contemplating (= getting used to the price) bronze, so that the lightning-protection-grounding will work. The sheet will protrude side-wise so that it serves as the base for the chine-runner, and the body made from epoxy-with-fibreglass-filler
