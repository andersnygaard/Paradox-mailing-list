I bet she doesn't sail for hours downwind! 

Come on Chris, don't make unsubstantiated statements. There's too much defensiveness on this list. I'm getting sick of it. I'm here to sail my Paradox heaps, share what I've learned (honestly, not made up half-truths), so that prospective builders can judge ACCURATELY what a Paradox is like. 

It's just a boat after all and most boats sail quite similarly. But, if people are going to keep making things up about their Paradox, then I might as well leave this list. The Internet being the Internet you're all going to come down hard on me and there's no point reading the responses, so I'm unsubscribing now. 

I'll continue posting videos of my adventures on YouTube for any of you that care to view them.

Cheers,
Rob.
