Hi David,

I don't have any specific advice for you regarding your outboard.

But I am excited about your cruise route.  Where are you starting and
finishing?  I've imagined a trip from Chattanooga to Mobile.  I'm
fascinated by the lock system and would love to see the landscape
transition from mountains to coastal flat land.

Cheers,

John
