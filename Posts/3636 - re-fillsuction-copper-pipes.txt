If you had lead, then the lead could be just screwed
to the bottom couldn't it? Then there would be a gain
of space for.........for storing drinking water in
plastic bottles. Much more wholesome than having it
lurking in a plywood box.

The lead could be screwed to the bottom, but the
mixture of sand and resin will permanently hold it in place.  I used this method on my 25
ft Folksong and the sand added weight.  It worked well.

Just a suggestion; although if you did try it, the
epoxy sure gets hot when curing.

Er thanks Bill. 

Sorry to be so dense, but I still don't understand why you mix sand with the resin. If you need more weight you could add a touch more lead and if you want more strength then you could use glass cloth with the resin as re-inforcement. But sand - wet or dry - I'm mystified....
