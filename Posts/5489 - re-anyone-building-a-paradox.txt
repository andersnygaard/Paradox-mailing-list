Bill, it's very close to done. Today the sail kit arrived in the mail, UPS actually. I spent alot of today making the tackstrop hardware. And a little snooping into the sailmaking instructions. They did all the hard parts by computer and plotter. I can do this. They gave me gobs of cloth to practice on. I don't see how they can make a profit! Tomarrow I will cut and fit the windows. And maybe install the cabin sole too. The weather is so nice right now. I may launch before the sail is done just to see if the trailer modifications/addaptations I've done will work. And to try out the Yuloh. Steve Yahn
