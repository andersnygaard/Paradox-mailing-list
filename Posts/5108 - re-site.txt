Hello, 

I subscribed to this group, send mails to Don Elliot and never had an answer.

Thanks,

Hello-

I think I know what you want to do and I think I know how to do it. Go to paradoxboatbuilders@yahoo.com and ask to join that group. There shouldn't be any problem joining the site, but watch out for the moderator, Don Elliott. He's a bit lunatic about keeping on the subject of the Paradox as designed by Matt Layden, with no discussion allowed about any changes at all.

Hello. 

In messages of 2001 found a series of articles on the construction of Paradox indicating http://www.tomah.com/delliott/. Unable to access the site and would like to know if someone has the files contained therein. 

Many thanks, 
Alberto
