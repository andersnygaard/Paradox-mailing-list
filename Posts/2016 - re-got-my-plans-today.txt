Hi Ron.

I'm down river from Deer Island. I'm currently fitting the interior of my boat, after having taken the winter off to pursue other projects. You can have a look at Swash in the photo album. Have you been working on your boat?

I became fascinated with the Paradox design because I think that it is quite well suited to year 'round sailing in the NW. If you do any sailing on the Columbia, you well know how crowded it can get with sailors, fishermen, and commercial shipping. Our winter conditions tend to keep all but the hardiest recreational boaters off the water, so I wanted something suitable for winter. Also, the lower Columbia, below Rainier offers some wonderful cruising grounds for the shoal draft sailor, though seldom visited by anything other than kayakers.

A drive across the Lewis and Clark bridge offers access to Interstate 5, and the lower Puget Sound, at Olympia, Washington. From there, a small boat can sail in the protected inland waters of Washington, and British Columbia. While the coasts of Oregon and Washington offer mediocre cruising, with some attention to conditions, short coastal passages may be made to various ports where upriver cruising can be enjoyed. 

If I decide to leave the trailer at home, and sail South to Mexico, I feel confident that this design has the features that I deem necessary. Of course, I could always haul Swash down to the Sea of Cortez on her trailer, but I may be more inclined to do so with a multihull such as a Farrier tri, or a Woods Wizard or Sango cat. 

I'm a big believer in several boats for specific requirements, rather than one boat for all requirements. I'm building Swash to hold onto for the rest of my life.
