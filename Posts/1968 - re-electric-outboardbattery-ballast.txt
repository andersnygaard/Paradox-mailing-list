Yes, if I fit an outboard it will almost certainly be electric. As you say the batteries can replace some of the lead ballast. I would not bother with an autohelm, however, as Paradox was designed to sail without constant attention to the controls anyway. In open water I check the course every 5 mins or so as part of my general look-out routine.

Subject: [paradoxbuilders] Electric outboard/battery ballast

Has anyone considered using deep cycle gel batteries instead of just lead for ballast and then using the added benefit of the power for an electric outboard, autohelm and radio? I was thinking of a stretch (15-20%) with the extra width used to keep the main area open but wider bins on the sides with a number of batteries forward/aft of bulkhead #3 in the bottom of the bin area as ballast and a power source.
