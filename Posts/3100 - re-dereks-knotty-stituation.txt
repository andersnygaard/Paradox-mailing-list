Subject: Re: Derek's Knotty Stituation

I've just ordered the bulk of my timber for Paradox from Robbins, so I'll be looking for knots too!  While the guarantee is in force.

Bill.

A phone call elicited a response so speedy that I wondered if it hadn't been learnt by rote for these occasions. Because the reply left me feeling a little uneasy I have sent three photos of the knots to Robbins and invited them to consider their answer after seeing the pics. I've told them that I am quite happy to epoxy the gaps if that is their considered opinion.

Now that it is all in printable form they are being slower with their answers or suggestions.

I have suggested in my email that if I suffered a boom breakage that put me in danger they would definitely hear from me again. I am hoping that what ever the reply is it will at least be well thought out.
