Yes as soon as there is enough light this morning I'll take a shot. It does get crowded up there. I'll send a shot of my other mast too, for a Stevensons Cruiser, you can see I added shackles and wire hoops to separate the pulleys on that boat, So they don't bind. Binding only occurs at full sail up. I can't raise the masts today; the exit to the workshop is blocked by another project, and the shed roof is too low to step the masts inside. So see if the pics help as they are, with the mast laying down. It's sun up now so in maybe two hours there will be sufficient light for photography.
