No the new boat is not a sharpie, but she is small at just 17 feet and has a cabin, hatch, vent box, and inside steering just like Small Fry. Eventually I'll post something about that in another thread.

A bit more about Small Fry: her sail, as depicted in a few of the shots already posted, was built at Tasker's sail loft, and I was very pleased that they took on board the description available from the microcruising site. The result was a very nicely shaped sail in 5 ounce tanbark dacron cloth which sets well in a wide range of conditions. Between cruises Small Fry and her rig are kept in doors and consequently the sail is still in great condition. Small Fry's lug sail makes no noise when tacking and gybing which usually takes place in a gentle fashion. Not only is this good for sail longevity, but it goes very easy on the cruising sailor making for very pleasant cruising.

Small Fry, Fremantle.
