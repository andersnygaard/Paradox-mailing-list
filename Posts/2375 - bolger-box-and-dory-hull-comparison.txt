Subject: Bolger Box and Dory Hull Comparison

I found a link that just happens to have the article I mentioned previously regarding dory and box hulls.

http://www.boatdesign.com/tomboy/Cooper/Page.html

Obviously this does not have any direct reference to chine runners but it is interesting for several reasons.

If you look at the cross-section of the two boats amidships and imagine where chine runners would be, I think you might realize how they might be more effective with the sharpie hull.

You can see from Bolger's redesign of the St. Pierre Dory, he added considerably more freeboard - which is the darker shaded section where the porthole is located.

You can also see that although Jesse Cooper is almost the exact same shape as Paradox, it is not ballasted deeply enough to allow chine runners. Therefore a huge daggerboard is used. In his later update it was changed to two bilgeboards. Also this older design required a lot more ballast than was originally indicated. Some 1400 pounds of concrete and iron in one version that was used a ways off-shore. 

Also you will notice that both boats are about the same length and 
beam, yet the sharpie shape has a lot more interior room. This was actually the main purpose of the comparison. The builder lived aboard the JC for several years which would have been a lot more cramped in the dory hull.

It also seems that the fin keel on the dory is the best solution to 
make it a good capable sailboat. It will work effeciently and provide 
stability down low, if it is heavy enough.

Many people have read the book written by Annie Hill(?) and Badger which was a dory hull. They did most of their cruising "downhill" and sat and waited for favorable winds. Then later they spent a considerable sum getting a new keel installed - a lot like the one here.
