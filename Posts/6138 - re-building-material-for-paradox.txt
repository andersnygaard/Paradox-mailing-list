I too took interest in Paradox and in Yrvind 1/2 nearly simultaneously. I am actually just a few minutes drive from where Sven's old double-ender Bris is stored. I've taken huge interest in building one (a Paradox) but also am really interested in Sven's ideas.

I think the foam is a great idea on many levels. One huge problem I see when Sven is sitting in his boat, is that that 2 inches of foam on all sides actually does a great bit to fill up precious interior space. I know that Sven is known for his ability to adapt to a small space. On Bris (which I had the pleasure of boarding and checking out) there is a great deal of space. The dimensions, especially headroom, was astonishing considering the size of the boat. In the beginnings of his build page, Sven actually shows the forms he is using to frame out the divinycell. Then, seemingly on the spot, he chose to chop the boat's dimensions down considerably. On top of that, he uses the very thick divinycell. Of course, the forms represented INTERIOR space regardless, but I know I would have chosen that *slightly* larger boat. I'm taller than Sven anyways, a great excuse to go slightly larger!

I'm going to build *something*. I am devoted to the Paradox concept and excited about working towards that goal, but the pvc foam is definitely a consideration. I would deliver some kind of advice, but I am just embarking on this journey myself. I am giving myself some time to save up $$$, theorize on possible alternative rigs, and schooling myself up in Matt Layden's designs so that I will do some justice to the Paradox pedigree when considering where I go.

Glad to hear of other people tracking on these awesome projects (Sven's most of all!).
