Having struggled with tight watermaker membrane installations, I have been told by membrane manufacturers and suppliers than glycerin is a good lubricant for water system o-rings. I've used it with good success on the beckson deckplates too. I'm much in favor of the tool that Glen describes, but I've also used the rubber coated handles of a pair of Channelocks (pliers) coupled with a wrench to give that extra oomf to seat the o-rings.
