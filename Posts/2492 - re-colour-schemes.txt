Thanks Dave,

I hadn't thought of that. 

I had a go in PS Elements and found a green that I like. A little more greenish than olive 
but still light. I can get it mixed at the local paint suppliers if it isn't a stock colour. I 
suppose household paint will be ok (and cheaper than 'yacht' paints), I think that Al used 
household paint on Little Jim.

Merry Xmas to you and Mindy (you are that Dave aren't you?)
