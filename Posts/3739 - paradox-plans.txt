Subject: Paradox Plans

Hello,

I am in Panama City and I want to purchase some Paradox plans. I have tried to contact mbolduc@triad.rr.com with no response. I do use a freight forwarder so I have a Miami address and do not need to use my Panama address.

I would send the money order via Fed Ex with a Fed Ex envelope included to return the plans or whatever packaging is required. What packaging is required? A tube? A standard Fed Ex envelope or bag?

Where are you Dave? I am anxious to get the ball rolling.

Regards
Steve in Panama
