Deric,

I've been building thinking... if I build this bit can I store it out of the way while the build continues?  I've also been thinking, what can I build without having to resort to putting the hull together, so that putting the hull together has been delayed until it can't possibly be put off any longer. The main reason for this approach has been to keep my work area, which is small, as uncluttered as possible and also to familiarise myself with the plans and so to hopefully avoid making any large mistakes (I'm not sure that has worked though)!

My build has gone like this, so far:

Mast head light, mast, yard, yuloh, boom, lower gudgeon, stainless steel tack downhaul, stem, rudder cheek, rudder, bulkheads 3, 1, 4, transom, 2, deck beams, bulkhead 2 mast step, scarf and join sides.

Most of these components are between 90% to 95% complete, because I want to be sure they fit into the hull correctly when it is assembled.  The order of the components generally isn't that important, although some things do depend on others e.g. the mast step is dependent on bulkhead 2 being completed.

Interesting to note the very different times to completion people have had. Clearly, build time vs time to completion depends on your life situation. Seems like the build time for most of us is somewhere between 900 to 1100 hours?

Cheers,

Rob.
