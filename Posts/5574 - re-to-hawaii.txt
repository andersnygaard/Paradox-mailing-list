Roughly 2300 miles in a 14' boat?  Not impossible - few things are if you set your mind to it, but I think your imagination is far greater than your current capability - especially as you're only just about to start sailing lessons!  A liferaft would be essential equipment - but where would you put it so that it would be readily available if the worst happened?

A rough calculation tells me that you would be looking at a passage of well over a month at sea in all weathers, this is assuming that you averaged 3 knots and travelled in a straight line.  I've recently cruised from Falmouth, UK, to the Isles of Scilly and back, in decent weather, in a 22 footer which has a bit of room to move about in.  This is a distance of about 140 miles in total and I was glad to put my feet on solid ground by the end of it.

I suggest you Google 'Donald Crowhurst'!
