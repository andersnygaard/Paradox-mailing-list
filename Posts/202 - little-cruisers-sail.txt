Subject: Little Cruiser's sail

The unstretched Paradox sail is 100 square feet, so if you increase the design by 10% then it would be 110 square feet. However, Little Cruiser is 15'1" long, and she has a sail area of about 120 sq feet. Therefore, 120 square feet would be a good point to start at if you stretched Paradox 10%, (approximately 15.4 feet).
