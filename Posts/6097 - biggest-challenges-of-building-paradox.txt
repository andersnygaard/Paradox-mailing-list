Subject: Biggest challenges of building Paradox

It's a bet. :-)

Here are the things that immediately worry me:

-- Building jigs, something needs to be done pretty early in the process.  I have no experience with jigs.  The deck beam jig arrangement looks complex, with several pieces of wood needing to be bent at once and clamped.  Is two hands enough, or does this require a helper?

-- Laying out the parts on the plywood; one sheet has "not a single spare mm wood."  I may need to be an extra sheet after I botch the first one...

-- Making the stem looks like a bear of a job.

-- I can use a block plane for simple planing, but I fear anything that requires complex shaping.  It will be too easy to overshoot.

-- Scarfing the side and bottom panels evenly and smoothly.  I've never scarfed anything and I'm not even sure what tools to use.  It seems to me that a plane would tear the wood at its edge when used at steep angles.

-- Fitting and bending the sheer strakes and chine logs.  I'm an average height and weight woman, not known for strong muscles.

-- Mixing and applying epoxy fast enough when working with large pieces of wood, e.g. side and bottom panels.

-- Molding and making the gudgeon (probably not too hard, actually, but the process is totally outside my experience).

And last, but certainly not least:

-- Keeping up focus for the 2 to 3 years that is clearly required to build it, while dealing with the pressures of my job.


I just received the plans for Jim Michalak's Robbsboat, and I've ordered the Paradox plans but not received them.  I'm looking forward to studying and comparing several sets of plans for different boats.
