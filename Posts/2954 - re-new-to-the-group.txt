Subject: Re: new to the group.....

Don Elliot banned himself. He was directly attacking and insulting individual members as well as being verbally abusive to the general membership. If you questioned anything he said you got flamed and insulted.

I don't think it is fair to judge him and nutty with the same yardstick. I have never read in any of T. Lee's posts where he has verbally attacked another person. He always sticks to the subject at hand and debates it only. Both are rather opininated is all but is that wrong? 

I was banned from one of Don's group and I hadn't even posted anything but he didn't like what I had posted on another group!
