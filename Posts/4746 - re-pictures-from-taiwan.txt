It's coming on great, you're very nearly there.
I found your Blog the other day and found it really interesting.
The translation that Google provides has a bit to be desired, but I 
follow the gist of what you are saying.
Others may be interested so I've posted the link here

Unfortunately my own building has ground to a standstill with cold 
weather, damp and darkness!
I hope to get started again as soon as the spring arrives!

Your boat and Jimmy's are looking really great - 2 more water babies 
in the making to be born in 2008 as members of the Paradox family.  
Congratulations on your progress and more to come when they take to 
the water.
Bill.
