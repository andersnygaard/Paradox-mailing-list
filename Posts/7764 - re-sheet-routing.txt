Sorry, guys. It looks as though this newbie reinvented the wheel. I've since noticed at least one Paradox where the deck fairlead is on the deck rather than the transom. IIRC, it was Johanna, although I've looked at so many pictures of so many boats in the last week that they are starting to blur together.
