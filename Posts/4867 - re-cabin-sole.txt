Hi,

I cannot agree more, but I cannot see the rational of carrying all that weight around on the trailer, or that matter in light winds, or up a beach, (when you can substitute it by water ballast), but if you want an all weather micro cruiser the paradox is the way to go, but for some, Enigma is the way to go.

Yours,
James
