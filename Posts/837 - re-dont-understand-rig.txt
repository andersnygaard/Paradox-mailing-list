I am thinking of building my own paradox. I use to own a lancer 28. What i dont under stand when you are on a port or starbord tack is the sail rubing the mast on either one of thouse tacks. And is the mast in the center port to starboard.

Yes, on the starboard tack the sail bears against the mast.
And no, the mast is not on the centre line, it is offset to port.
