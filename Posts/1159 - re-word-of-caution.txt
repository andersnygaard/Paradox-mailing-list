If you plan to install a Hasp on the hatch to lock your Paradox,
always install the hinged part on the aft window, NEVER on the hatch
itself ! If everthing is lined up right, and you close the hatch from
the inside, you could lock yourself inside ! Not that I have done
this, but in 90 deg weather it will get really hot in there untill
sombody lets you out. Just a thought........ It did happen.

While building Little Jim I had vague worries about someone 
locking me in while I was asleep, so tried to come up with an 
arrangement where the hinged part could be parked inside as well 
as outside. However when I reached that part of the construction I 
simply drilled a hole through the hatch rail, parallel to the deck, just 
in front of the closed hatch. Now I simply pop a padlock through 
the hole and the hatch is locked.

Hoping for calm nights
