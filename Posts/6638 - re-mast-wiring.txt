Have a look at 
http://www.little.jim.freeuk.com/navlight/navlight_1.htm

The bottom ring consists of 6 white LEDs, the top has a number of 
red, green and white LEDs.

The RGW is not very good as there is quite a large overlap of 
colours. If I were doing it again I would just do the white (which is 
legal under the colregs for a boat this size)

I string the LEDs in series and regulate the voltage with a simple 
resistor, a proper voltage regulator would probably be better.

Hoping for calm nights
