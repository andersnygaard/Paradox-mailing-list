Hi all,
I have never posted here before, although I have closely followed with great interest this truly inspirational group and I have long idolized nay coveted, all of the Matt Layden inspired, Paradox Cruisers that have been so beautifully crafted all around the world.

On a personal note, for many years now, initially just to save money and to allow for more flexible working arrangements, {teaching scuba diving, swimming and life-guarding} I have chosen to live solely out of the back of my van, otherwise known as Boondocking, in these days of credit crunches and imminently looming country wide depressions. Over the years I have become very accustomed and even enjoy/prefer living this way. Although for a long time I have wanted to live on and travel solely by water, I did not want to change my beloved alternative lifestyle to much, except for the odd little extra luxury that I felt the right boat may afford me.

With these factors firmly in mind and because recently a kind person donated a corner of her extremely large stable yard for me to camp and construct in, I have taken a whole year off work and with the savings I have put away over the years, started to build a 28 foot live a board Paradox Cruiser.

Thanks for your time in this matter, I look forward to hearing your views and theories on this ermm "Paradox!"
Kind Regards - David.
