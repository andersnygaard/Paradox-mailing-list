I haven't started my Paradox yet, I have a couple of simpler boat projects in the queue first.

I want my Paradox to benefit from the mistakes I'm bound to make on my first couple of projects.

I'm very interested in your variant, NOLI, it sounds like the slightly bigger Paradox I've imagined for myself.
