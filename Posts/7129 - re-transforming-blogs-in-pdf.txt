Fernando,

As a blog author, I would probably not go to the trouble to put this on the yahoo site, mainly because I don't know if anyone is interested in the information.  I do not mind if someone takes a post and puts it on the yahoo site.  It always surprises me when I see mention of my build.  I think, "WOW, someone is reading my blog."  :)
