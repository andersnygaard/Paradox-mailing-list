You can make an individual photo album.. but only a moderator can capture and mirror all the contents over to this group. All photo albums keeping the names of that group member who created it, all files, links, databases, membership records and all of the archives. Individuals can only save and put bits and pieces.

I offered to moderate the other group but still could not have mirrored all the contents over to this group.

With all these announcements that Don's groups is closing here is a suggestion. Go to the group, and download the files and pictures and post them here. It is easy to do. I'd do it, if I had access to Don's group. If you don't want the information to die, do something about it. You could be the one who keeps it from disappearing forever!
