Subject: Re: Plywood Choices

Hi Joe,
Welcome aboard.
I agree with Nels. With the money you would save on not concreting, spend some of it on upgrading the plywood. 
The difference in price between good and crap plywood is very small in comparison with the total cost of the build. Even going down the Marine Plywood route.
Builders will cut costs and use inferior materials where it counts only to spend a fortune on "toys" for that boat that are a complete waste of time and of much use for their type of sailing.

Hi Chris,

I would agree with Stephen that it can be built on a gravel floor. 
You can create a level framework by driving some short posts in the 
ground and installing 2X4's that are checked for level both ways. 
That will help as a level reference base.

I would also suggest you not scrimp on too cheap a plywood. That is 
the wrong place to save money as you will just have to use more 
glass and epoxy to get a good seal. I strongly recommend MDO 
plywood. It is an exterior grade that is used for highway signs and 
concrete forms and has a very smooth surface that saves a lot of 
sanding and will not check like regular fir plywood. If you can 
afford it you will never regret using it as you proceed. It also 
holds paint better than any other plywood, which means less 
maintenance if kept in the water for any length of time.

You should be able to get it locally as the main plant is in 
Washington State.
