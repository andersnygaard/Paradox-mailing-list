Thanks for the quick reply Chris. That explains it. If I were in the Bahamas I probably wouldn't be bothering with emails either:) I'll just wait 'til I hear from him. 

Hi Nathan,

as I know,Dave is in the Bahamas on tour! So you just have to wait till he gets on the Internet again!

If anyone knows Dave personally, and can confirm that's correct, I'll send him a check and hope the plans show up.

Cheers,
Nathan
