Hi Thanks Jeff, 
That makes me encouraged that i is do able without the trailer, but I 
have trailer if needs be. 
What is the hull depth of paradox / enigma, 
I presume that enigma is shallower, I will be having a hull depth of 
2ft, which I think is alot more like enigma depth.
I would like all the comfort of paradox with the sailing performance 
and light weight of goat island skiff! 
Yours james

Hi James.
I used 1/4" Gaboon Ply for NOLI for the sides and 3/8" for the bottom.
The 1/4" ply weighs only 16 lbs. This one of the reasons to use Marine grade over exterior ply.
Before I glassed her all over NOLI, 3 layers on the bottom, I could quite easily lift her by the bow or stern with one hand, now it take's 2.
By the way. A VW Golf can take 220 lbs on its (VW)roof rack.
As they always understate these figures, NOLI empty should be able to be roof racked  :-o
I will stick with a trailer any day.
