Not me, I'm afraid. All the fillers I used came from the resin 
supplier.

Microfibres to reduce the brittleness of the resin where gap filling 
was required. (there was lots of that)

Glass Bubbles for filleting where easy sanding was required.

Colloidal Silica to prevent slumping where the application was on 
vertical or overhead surfaces.
