I built a boat a while back that needed some $$$ spent on key areas. I cut a lot of corners to save money, and the boat only lasted about 7 years due to material choices.

It was a different design, but the results would likely be similar. If you want to be able to confidently enjoy the boat for years to come, I’d suggest following the designer’s material list. I find mentally averaging out the cost of that wood over the joy it will bring during the boat’s entire lifetime helps it hurt a little less when you think about it.
