Hi Brian,

Congratulations for a good start!

What concerns about shaping all sides to be the same - I just shaped one and and trimmed the other by router bit with bearing. Takes much less effort on shaping. The same with rudder and rudderhead. Of course one has to have a router for that.

What concerns to plywood - as long as it is exterior grade, it has the same glue. Difference will be the voids that normal exterior grade may have a few or many. The okoume marine plywood that I use for my Paradox is not well accepted in boatbuilding in France, people in other forums say... Additionally there is used monoethylene glycol for protecting wood from rotting and increasing epoxy bond, to be applied 50% solution before epoxy sealing and let dried, to reduce the concern.

Regards,
Eerik
