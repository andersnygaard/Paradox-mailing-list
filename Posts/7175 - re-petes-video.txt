Al, I'd expect a bit of pitching with that wind over tide chop. You should have seen the pitching of the other boats that motored! (I didn't have my camera then).

It's amazing how benign the water looks from shore, it seemed a whole lot worse when I was out there :-) Pete

I knew it was pitching, just didn't realize how much. I suppose it may be something to do with sitting near the centre of rotation (and perhaps being so relaxed and comfy).

It may also be something to do with trusting the boat. On a similar theme, I realize it sometimes heels quite a lot, but as I know it won't go over I just ignore it and it doesn't seem too bad.
