Solar panel: I saw an advert just last week that Marley (I think) were marketing domestic solar panels that are the size of, and replace roof tiles. I don't know any more about them at the moment, but there will presumably be a cost benefit due to the standardisation and quantity. It was suggested that they are available for DIY fitting.

Yuloh: If I recall correctly Matt reckoned that he averaged 2 knots on the calm section of the Everglades Challenge.

Hi All,

Im installing a proper 12 volt system on Whisper and was wondering if anybody could recomend a good solar panel ? Im also considering sailing without an outboard and was wondering how fast could Paradox be propelled using the Yuloh ? (must stay out of the way of comercial traffic on the rivers I sail) Whisper did not come with one.(Next project) Any Info will be helpfull.

Hoping for calm nights
