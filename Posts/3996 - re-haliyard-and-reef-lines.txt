When I first launched Little Jim I occasionally had a problem with tacking; not coming up to the wind or getting stuck head to wind. I played with the trim and seem to have mostly sorted it, but it may just be me and not the boat at all.

It will sail on any point quite happily whatever the trim (I tried with a passenger and moved him about), it is just the tacking which seems to be sensitive. Of course it does gybe quite benignly so it is always possible to get round that way.

Hoping for calm nights
