Jimmy, 
It's coming on great, you're very nearly there. I found your Blog the other day and found it really interesting. The translation that Google provides has a bit to be desired, but I follow the gist of what you are saying. Others may be interested so I've posted the link here http://tinyurl.com/2qoynh

Unfortunately, my own building has ground to a standstill with cold weather, damp, and darkness! I hope to get started again as soon as the spring arrives!

Regards,
Pete
