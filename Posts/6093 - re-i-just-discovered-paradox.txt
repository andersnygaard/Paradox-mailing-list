Subject: Re: I just discovered Paradox

My current plan is to build a Bolger Tortoise, then a PDRacer, and then think about a "real" boat, which could be Paradox or any number of other possibilities.  The Tortoise and PDRacer are quick projects, and will also let me get in some real sailing experience.

I definitely will not start a project the size of Paradox without being sure that I can and will finish it.
