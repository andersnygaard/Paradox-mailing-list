Subject: Re: Scale mockup of wind genny and radar on Paradox

Hi Brent,

I like that you're pushing the envelope of technology on the Paradox design with the inclusion of generators and radar units.

With the addition of the 9lb. unit at the top of the mast, is there any consideration as to what this will do to righting moment corrections that might be necessary.

I understand that this was just to see if the units could fit as a conceptual approach. I was just curious if you had also looked into the balance needs any further.

I would like to see a suggested radar reflector, though, with a boat this close to the water. It's nice to think we could now see what was out there in lots of conditions, it's another to be seen and have some sort of chance to be avoided by a freighter that is clipping along at some astounding speed in the middle of the night.

I used to race cats and was once capsized in the main shipping channel outside the L.A Harbor at night. Very scary experience. Later, one of my friends, who was a first mate on a giant oil tanker, said I would have made the slightest of blips on the tachometer as my 20' cat ran through the churning prop. Not good to think about.

Nice drawing, by the way.
