Subject: Re: Mini Paradox idea

Why not?  Matt Layden's new boat, Enigma, is a scaled-down version of Paradox, in many respects.  It would be interesting to see if it could be scaled down even further.

If you just want to get on the water and learn to sail, the quickest and cheapest approach is to find a little old fiberglass boat for sale.  You can get to sailing in one of those for a lot less money than building anything in the same size range.  Second cheapest and fastest, I think, would be one of Jim Michalak's designs, which are optimized for cheap and easy building, but sail very well, from all reports.  A number of his designs use lug sails, too, so you could get experience with a rig with some of Paradox's characteristics.

Michalak's Piccup Squared, as an example:
