Hi DC, 

Thanks for your message! Please see my responses to your questions below:

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________

What do you estimate your dry weight will be when complete?

Not easy to tell without extensive calculating (I've tried), but I would guess my Paradox will be slightly lighter than Matt's design. Which is partly why I want a bottom metal sheeting.

Same construction for the house and deck?

Yes. Perhaps I will make the deck in 15mm divinycell, that depends on how much I have left of the 30mm, when that day comes

Are you using a carbon mast? 

Yes, cylindrical, diameter 60mm, thickness 2mm

Thanks again for your interest in my project! 

Best regards, 
Kjell Karlsson
