The answer is a little complex. Presuming you have built your Paradox to the design specifications and load it so that you are exactly on the design WL when you are on board, the displacement is 1410 lbs. If you tow it to the launch site fully loaded except for yourself, (say you weigh 200 lbs) the  trailer-weight should be 1210 lbs, and towing weight that plus the weight of the trailer. Supposing you trailer her with the water tanks empty the trailer-weight would be about 1060 lbs. Based on what I have read I think Matt took ballast out replacing it with stores when planning a long cruise, and replaced depleated stores with sand or gravel in bags.
Boats seldom actually have the exact designed displacement. Paradox would probably not notice 100 lbs either more or less than the designed displacement, perhaps more.

Thanks, Al, but spending more than an hour at the ramp doesn't appeal. And since appropriate ballast low down is crucial to self-righting, I expected it wouldn't be that simple to adjust load capacity. A better way to phrase my question might be: what does a Paradox weigh, rigged and with all ballast aboard? More than just trailer weight, I want to know what it's capable of carrying--so I'll know both what is demanded of the trailer, AND how much more weight it takes to get to the dwl.
