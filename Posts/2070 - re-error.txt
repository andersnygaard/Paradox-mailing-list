Thanks for the heads up David.

I think that I've managed to get the photos section pared down to the point where everyone can once again gain access.

I found that I was unable to simply reduce some large format photos, rather, I had to completely remove (3) photos. I chose to remove these three photos based entirely on their content, which while perhaps of great general interest and/or beauty, may not have been directly relevant to Paradox. I hope that their owners will understand that I mean no offense by removing them. These (3) photos were:

1) 9' steel dinghy
2) Bris rudder
3) "water in my backyard"

We still have storage capacity in the files section. Earlier, Glen expressed some reluctance to posting photos in the files section, but it obvious that we no longer have room in the photos section. 

Paradoxbuilders2 is available for photos and files. Perhaps it would make sense to utilize the files section of Paradoxbuilders2 for posting photos in folders, while reserving the remaining files section of Paradoxbuilders for data.
