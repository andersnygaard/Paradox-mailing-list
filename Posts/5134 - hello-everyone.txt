Subject: Hello everyone

I thought I'd introduce myself.

Having seen 'Little Jim' and 'Faith' at sea recently, and on the Scillywebcam Isles of Scilly website, and being quite taken by the concept I thought I'd have a crack at building one of these little beauties.

I showed my son some photo's that I'd taken of the two boats and he exclaimed "I like that!"  Now he wants a hand in the construction, the costs and ultimately the fun.

My set of plans arrived today, now all I have to do is clear a space in the garage and get the tools sorted out before heading off to the timber merchants.
