Probably too chicken!  The plans have me impressed enough with the complexity of this build that I'm afraid of making it worse!  Maybe with Ironsides-style bracing, lowering the opening of the "stateroom" and maybe also bulkhead 4, and adopting Johanna's aft cabin washboard, I'll find the original size roomy enough for this oversized skipper.  Anyway, this is down the road when my boys don't want to crew with me anymore. Jeff MB

A couple of questions for the experienced set: how shallow can your Paradox sail?  What are typical angles of heel?  How fast is she in light airs (say 5kt) and good breezes (say 15kt)?  At what wind speed does she hit her hull speed?

I have sailed in less than a foot, though there is a tendency for the chine to rub on the bottom if you don't keep it flat.

When sailing in a good wind, and going well to windward, 20 degrees heel seems to be about the optimum. More than that and I feel we are over canvassed.

In light winds, off the wind, it sails better than many more conventional boats of a similar size, but doesn't do as well in fluky winds where the weight stops it accelerating like the lighter boats.  Hard on the wind it is generally slower than everything (except a West Wight Potter)

In 15 knots of wind, it will easily reach hull speed.
