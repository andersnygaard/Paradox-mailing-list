Subject: Re: Video - Paradox Scout...2nd shakedown sail....20+ knots of wind.

Glad to see you are getting out there and enjoying your boat.

Did you intentionally mount the seat higher than the plans say? (Or 
are you particularly tall?) On my Paradox the boom passes well clear 
of my head and the sail does not obstruct my view. When heeled over 
and 'lounging' my shoulder fits just under the top cabin member and 
only my head is in the wind.
