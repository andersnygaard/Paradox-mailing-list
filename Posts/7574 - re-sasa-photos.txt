Re-reading your message gave me the answer: you'll have two tillers.

I'm looking at your build (and others) before deciding whether to build a Paradox myself.

You're putting the tiller above the after deck instead of through the transom. So you won't need the hole in the transom. I see your transom has no holes, neither for the tiller nor for the spars.
So why have you installed the bendy-scoopy-water-drainy thing inside the transom?

I'm impressed that you have built a curved transom: could you give us more details on how you did that?

Oops, problem uploading pics, going to Johanna file. Sorry about that.
There is a photo of the 'upper tiller', above deck to enable selfsteering. There will also the beneath deck tiller as well for interior steering.
