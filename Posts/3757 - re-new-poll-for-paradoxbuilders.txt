Well, at the moment I have 100 lb of lead, but I have just fitted a 
50 lb battery and an electric outboard I also have 3 anchors with 
chain, drinking water on top of the ballast water, another battery 
for the lights etc, Tins of food, ..........

One great advantage of the Paradox is that, if you think it might be 
useful, you can just take it with you. Extra weight isn't a problem.

For some short trips I have not bothered to fill the water ballast. 
The boat seems to sail just as well, but (it may be my imagination) 
feels a little more tender.

The weights come with steel clips to fix them to the wheels. If you 
melt them down to make bricks (a bread tin makes a good mould) the 
steel will float to the top and can be scraped off.

Hoping for calm nights
