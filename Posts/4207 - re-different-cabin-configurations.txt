Why? Little Cruiser has a removable rear window, but Matt obviously didn't think it was a good enough idea to include it in Paradox. I can't think of a time when I would have used them. If the weather is nice you are outside, if it turns nasty you go inside.

Derek Clark spent quite a while playing with ideas like this (delaying the launch of Enuf by a couple of months). He built several mock-ups but eventually stayed with the plans.

The ventilation inside, even when all shut up, is good enough. One of my personal 'improvements' is the addition of a towel to the inventory so I can stuff it in the vent box to reduce the air flow as I sometimes find the nights too cold.

While I was building I thought up lots of improvements to Matt's design. I fortunately then realised I didn't have a fraction of his ability or experience so decided to build to plan knowing that I could make changes later if I still wanted to. I found I didn't want to. Not one of my ideas, formulated before sailing the boat, would have improved the boat. I have, however, modified some of the storage bins, which makes them easier to access but hasn't noticeably affected the sailing ability.

Hoping for calm nights
