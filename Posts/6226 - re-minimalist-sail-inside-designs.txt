For a pd racer with a cabin look at the youtube video of

Where do you think I got the idea from? :-)

The problem with Tenacious Turtle is that the cabin only serves
as storage when sailing, and gives partial cover at night.  But
it isn't situated properly to allow the captain to actually sail
the boat from inside the cabin a la Paradox.

A light boat like this is very easy to manoever on a small
trailer.It is much easier than car-topping if you sail alone.

Assuming you have a place to store the trailer!  I sometimes
feel like the only apartment-dweller on this group.
