Hi Kjell,

A friend who lives in Sweden was telling me he saw a documentary about Sven last year that was very fascinating. He said:

"Nels.......i=B4m aware of Sven Yrvind. i.e. a FASCINATING character, to say the least!
I saw a documentary about him, last year, and he showed his HUGE collection of books, related to the sea."

Now this fellow actually has a small publishing company, but I am not sure if he could do an English printing. I am wondering how many pages are in the book? And who has the copyright? I was thinking we could get several people each translating one chapter and make a limited edition printing based on pre-orders.

Another option is an e-book available right off Sven's website and paying through paypal.

Best Regards, 
Nels
