Subject: Re: Grettings! New Paradox inductee here... Need help with Yuloh specs

Congratulations Sean,

That is one lovely boat the Lezlie has put together.
I'm sure you'll enjoy it once you get delivery!

As for the Yuloh.
The details are on sheet 12 of the plans which is labelled "spar details"
It shows the dimensions of the mast, boom, yard and Yuloh.

Check and let me know if you can't find it.

Best wishes.
Pete
