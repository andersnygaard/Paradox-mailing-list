Subject: Re: Sheet Lead Ballast

Al and those of you who actually have sailed Paradox,

My thoughts concerning a bottom metal sheet were to locate some of the
ballast there, about 50-70kg, the remaining for inside trimming. Matt
specifies 70-180kg total. How much would you say is needed for
one-person weekend sailing and how much for a long tour max load?
