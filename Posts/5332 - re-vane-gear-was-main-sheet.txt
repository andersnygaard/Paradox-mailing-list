Subject: Re: Vane Gear was: Main sheet

Hi Glen,

I also have some questions about your vane gear but want to be 
sensitive to your need to spend time with your wife. 

You were kind enough to offer some encouraging words about the 
Paradox I built a couple of years ago. Pictures of "Raffles" can be 
seen on Bill's site as 'Mark Waters' Paradox'. Unfortunately, I have 
not been able to take the boat out much due to one personal crisis 
after the next. Hopefully, that is now all behind me and I can finish 
the one remaining project - building a self-steering wind vane. 

I am wondering if you could point me, Rod, and anyone else who is 
interested to some good sources of information. I have found one site 
on the web - www.mindspring.com/~waltmur/Self-Steering . Looking at 
some of these designs I see some similarities with the vane on "Zoe". 
Is that correct and if so which design did you go with and did you 
make any dimensional changes? Also I was wondering if you have done 
any sheet to tiller experiments? I was happily suprised at how 
well "Raffles" tracks and could not help but wonder whether a more 
simple old fashioned direct vane (non servo pendulum) might work? 

Many thanks,

Mark
