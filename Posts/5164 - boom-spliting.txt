Subject: Boom splitting

A question for you guys with finished boats. Concerning the boom. Is there any trouble with the bolt for the mainsheet tang, splitting the wood or cracking? Bill, you mentioned that the bolt fell out? I'm at a point when I could add a band of fiberglass around the end of the boom, as long as I'm fiberglassing the reefing spool too. Any thoughts appreciated.
