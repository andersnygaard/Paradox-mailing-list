Don't be fooled by the looks, there is plenty of technology and complexity in a Paradox, how else could it be bigger inside than outside.

The questions that should be getting asked are: 

Why would you want to build anything other than a Paradox?

Why build a big boat (with all the associated expenses) when a small boat will do the job as well (better?)?

Why build a deep draught boat when shallow works?

Paradox is not perfect for all occasions, but if you want what it does well, why settle for anything less?
