Wayne,
It is not really a boat for two. When sailing there is only room for one on the captain's seat, so any passengers must stay below, not a disaster, but not as nice as being in the open on a nice day.

Sleeping with two would be a cosy affair, but not impossible. More width can be gained by modifying the storage arrangements. I believe Kjell Karlsson has done this with his boat (as well as changing the build method from ply to composite sandwich) He has put some pictures in the files section, under Paraplastic, which include one with 2 people lying down inside.

Have a look at http://www.smallsailboats.co.uk/ for information about all the Paradox builders in the known (internet) world. 

I'm sure there are more builders who are not represented on the site and I would encourage them to get in touch with me.  I'd like to have as comprehensive a list as possible.
