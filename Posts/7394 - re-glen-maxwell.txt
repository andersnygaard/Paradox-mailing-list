He seemed to try, forwarding a few checks for a couple of thousand. After that they did not answer my emails or calls and so I just wrote it off to experience. In the future I will require a copy of actual policy or an agent's name before shipping through U-Ship. 

I have a lot of hobby interests, so at least I feel don't feel too deprived.

Thanks Mark, did the trucker ever make good on the loss?

Glen,

I am sorry to hear you did not go on that trip. You put your heart and soul into building one of the finest Paradox's ever built. After the trucker told me I was stunned, but I was not the creator...just the hoped for care taker of legacy. I almost bought another Paradox, but never felt the same about any other boat. Keep in touch...

Mark

Hello David,

I'm afraid life has gotten in the way of my trip and I have had to postpone it. I am hoping to getaway now in Oct. of this year if I can. I fell into a real depression at the loss of Zoe and have pretty much just been a lurker since. Thanks for your concern as to my whereabouts. I plan to be at the Cedar Key mess-about this year. Would be great to see you and the others if you are going to be there.

Best Regards

Glen
