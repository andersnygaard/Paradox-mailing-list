Nels,
I agree 100% with all you say and I understand the designer's issues with modifications to their well thought out designs. That being said, the major similarities between these two Bolger boats and the Paradox in shape leads me to wish for a test to see if chine runners would serve in shallow water. Gluing them on and cutting them off just doesn't seem like it need interfere with the use of the boat in its intended form. Easy for me to say when its not my boat.
Sincerely,
Gene T.
