Subject: Re: Fibreglassing 'Faith'

It's been a brilliant week for boatbuilding. I've been able to fully encapsulate the hull with woven roving and epoxy. I need to smooth the surface before painting.

Great going Bill, watch out for the snow on Sunday.

How do people finish their fibreglass sheathing? With my previous boats I've used plastic padding to good effect. It's so easy to sand, enabling a good finish.

I used epoxy with micro-balloons (also easy to sand) where I could be bothered.

Micro-balloons may be the better option; could also be cheaper.

Thanks,
Bill.
PS. I've already made the beams for the cabin top and the hatch - how long did you take to make the cabin top and the hatch? Not that I want to match your time, but I may have a better guess at how long it may take me.
