Quite right, I saw "wind vane" and read "wind generator". However, if someone were to insist on fitting a wind vane that is the only place that I can see where it would not get chewed up by sheet/boom.

In the Watertribe Discussion Forum recently Matt states "Paradox is designed to steer herself relative to wind direction with the helm locked, and does a pretty good job of it unless the wind is gusty or flukey." I have to concur with the second sentence.

Hi Al. 

While a windvane could conceivably be fitted forward of the mast, I question it's effectiveness.

Most boats can be made to sail to weather with little problem. When the wind is aft of the beam, self steering becomes much more difficult. If a vane were fitted forward of the mast, it would be sitting in dirty air whenever the wind was abaft the beam.

A windvane could easily be fitted forward of the mast
