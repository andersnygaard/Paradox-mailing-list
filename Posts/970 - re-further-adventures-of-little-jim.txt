I got back today from my longest trip so far in my Paradox. I was out for 4 days, had a splendid time, and am more than ever convinced that the Paradox is the right choice of boat for cruising in the British climate.

I will post a full report tomorrow when I have had a good night's sleep.

Hoping for calm nights
