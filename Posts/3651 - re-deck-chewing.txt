I see. Well thank you Al. By the way. When you are hoping for "calm nights". Just what is it at night that brings you trouble? This has made me curious every time I see your signature in Yeovil.

No, it is easy and natural to operate. You pull in the sheet by thrusting forward with your arm while bracing your back against bulkhead 4. The slack then, in my boat, falls into a bin behind bulkhead 4 where it cannot get tangled up round your feet. Very neat. Remember, it is not like a dinghy where you have to play the sheet the whole time, set the sail and lock it off then don't touch it again unless the wind or course changes. Boring really, take a good book. :-) 

Hoping for calm nights
Al,
Yeovil, England.
