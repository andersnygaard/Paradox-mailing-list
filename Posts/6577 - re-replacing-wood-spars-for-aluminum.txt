I'm not sure what you mean by "considering that you have copied so much from Paradox" Al. Do you mean the reefing system or the whole boat? I understand what was meant now with "missing an axis". It's not a big deal to modify the lower part to the original idea of a piece of string to make the universal joint. The castor joint is steel and should be plenty strong to take the tensile load.

It was just that I couldn't see why you had changed an elegant simple solution for a rather clunky alternative.

What are you estimating the load to be on the fitting during an inadvertent gybe? Remember this is a manoeuvre that, on some craft, breaks the boom.

Hoping for calm nights
