Subject: Re: trailer weight

Well, if you have ballasted it to be 1400 lb displacement, then you can calculate the trailer weight by what you take out. First you remove the skipper, then probably the water ballast. A few other items that you want in the car for some reason and you are probably down to somewhere around 1000 lb. That was what I based my trailer design on anyway, and it seems to work. 

If you want it lighter then you have to take more out (anchors, lead ballast, tins of food etc.) but then it takes longer at the launch site putting it all back in.

If you subsequently get a heavier anchor, or a heavier skipper, remove some of the lead to compensate.
