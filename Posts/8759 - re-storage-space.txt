Hi Bob

I didn't build my boat, but one of the first things I did after acquiring it was to make the entrance to the forward compartm3ent bigger, remove all the partitions in there including the false floor. The space then becomes bigger and more flexible to use.

More recently, I've done away with the water ballast to gain another 70 litres of space for heavy stuff.

Those Origo stoves are really better for big boats where you can use family size pans to cook for a group of people. For just one person a small camping size cooker with small pans is fine. .
Have a look at the Trangia. Pots sized for just one person, which store nested inside the cooker.Saves much space and tt works for me.
   
Best
 Jim
