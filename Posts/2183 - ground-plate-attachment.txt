Subject: Ground plate attachment

Glen, 

I was looking at your pictures of your ground plate in the files section, and I was wondering if it is flush with the bottom of the boat? I guess the bottom was faired level with the plate. Also, what type of caulking did you use to seal the vacuum bag over the plate?

Thanks,
Dave
