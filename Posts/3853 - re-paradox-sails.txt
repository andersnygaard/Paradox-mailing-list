Derek,

Your query on how to make the degree symbol on a Mac has brought me out of the woodwork. I've been reading the list for awhile as I might like to build a Paradox sometime.

To make the degree symbol, hold down the "option" key (to the left of the space-bar) and then press the number zero.

For example, I can say that now it is 73=BA outside, and test whether the symbol comes through properly to the list.
