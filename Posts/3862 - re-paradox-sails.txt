I'm not sure that it will be any help.
I've made my boom with the taper shown in the plan but I think that the increased angle of 
the tack on the MK2 sail means that the tack securing point has to be further back along the 
boom.
On the other hand I can't get my head around the sums but so long as my new boom rolls 
better than the last, why worry? I should know if it does on Tuesday.
