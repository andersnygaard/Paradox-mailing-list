Whilst we're all talking about modifications :-), I have a question for the group. What is the general opinion of the built in water tanks. I'm now at a stage where I need to finalise what I am going to do in this area. As I can't find anything good to be said about drinking out of Epoxy lined tanks, I would be using the area only for water ballast, which seems like a waste of space. That and the reports of leakage puts me off further. I had thought about having a couple of flexible tanks made and that's still an option, however I have been collecting 2 Litre pop bottles and now have enough to keep me watered for well over a week and I have still space to spare in the water tank area.

So I have a dilema; do I build the tanks as designed or just make the water tank area another storage area for water bottles, (perhaps a small flexible tank) provisions and extra ballast? I'd probably fit the forward sole as a single piece ( to create a rigid box section) and have a couple of lift off or hinging hatches to gain access. Also the rear sole plate specifies a continuous brass hinge. Bill, I'm sure the pictures on your site look like you have done something different, together with the samll removable sole plates each side of the water tanks? Am I right?

Whilst on the subject of modifications, I'm still really tempted to omit the rear of the cabin trunk and fabricate a drop in wash board instead (like Little cruiser and NOLI). I just think it would be nice to sit, on occassions, on the rear deck with my legs dangling into the cabin. I'd make it strong, lockable and as watertight as possible so that I can still have most of the benefits (and safety) of the current design.

Tell me I'm mad and just build as designed!
