Hi All,

In my last post I failed to mention that you do need to sand between coats for a really smooth finish. To speed sanding wash the panel (after coating) with soap and water (I use simple green) to remove the amine blush which will clog your paper. A very fast way to do this is to use a bucket and a spray bottle. Lightly spray on the soap (you don't need much) and scrub with a damp scotch brite pad, squeegee the soap and water off and rinse with a wet rag, squeegee off and let dry. I found this to make very little mess and it really speeds up the process. I use an auto window squeegee and find that the panels dry in no time.
