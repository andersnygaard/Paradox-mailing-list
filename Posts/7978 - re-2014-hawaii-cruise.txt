Because of being shaded while sailing the 50 watts of panels weren't quite enough, mostly because I kept moving most days, and I run more gadgets than I probably need. I will be doubling the panels to fix that on the next cruise. If I were to sail a day and rest a day the panels kept up.

For me, the Paradox is the most comfortable boat I've sailed. No sitting in the rain, no late night reefing or sail changes, no banging your shins on the ladder, no wet foul weather gear , no sleeping in a safety harness, and I could go on. When you really think about it all you need is a place long enough to lay down in and a place to sit and helm the boat from, if those places are warm, dry, and well ventilated you win. The Paradox gave me that and more.
