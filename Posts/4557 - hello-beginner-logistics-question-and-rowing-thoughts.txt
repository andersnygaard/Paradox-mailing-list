Subject: Hello, beginner logistics question and rowing thoughts

I'm converting a personal exerciser into a 60 Watt pedal generator. The basic unit was purchased "New" on eBay for $40. The parts required to convert using a home made PMG (Permanent Magnet Generator) costs $20-30 depending upon what components you already have in your workshop!
