No problem. It's just my opinion. You may be more gifted than you think when it comes to boat building, and you won't know until you try.  I learn kind of slowly, but I get there in the end.  Remember, measure twice and cut once.  In my case, I measure a dozen times, and then I cut. Then I sand.  Then I file. Then I glue on another piece because I filed too much away. Then I sand again. Damn, I shaved off too much again. Then I make a new piece, and that one fits perfect!
