Hi Andrew,

I did a google search on "Moreton Bay" and came up with this link:

http://www.mbcc.com.au/default.htm

Makes me very envious to observe some of the area you will be likely 
cruising in:-)

There are lots of links at the bottom of that page to other maps of 
the area as well.

Any chance you might run into "The Crocodile Hunter"?

Cheers, Nels
