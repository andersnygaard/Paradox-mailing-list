Hi all,

After a long absence due to work and health, I am back online and ready to get my Paradox going. 

I had started in September, with a couple of sheets of 9mm, set up my workshop and made paper patterns: but now I am ready to start again!

I have ordered the rest of the ply and some epoxy and am picking it up tomorrow after work!

Can't wait! I hope to get a lot done before I go away on exercise again in January (is there an alternative to working full time, please email any comments or suggestions: its annoying isnt?!@#) 

Glen, Zoe looks marvellous, the photo of her up against the dock is permanently on my computer as wallpaper.

I have an idea to put a small icebox in the second foreward compartment (starboard side opposite the battery) any suggestions/criticisms? Also a small detachable sink alongside the stove in the transom. 

Thanks all and glad to be back.
