Hi I think it might be do able, 
If one used 6mm or thiner for the cabin top, 
there seems to be lots of 4mm ply on ebay of late,
(what home builder doen't keep his eye out for cheap plywood.)
so long as the depth of the cabin was less than the hull, and the 
taper less than the hull, all would be ok, the spring in the roof 
would allow it to colapse into the hull? You could use a dozen 1/4 
bolts with wing nuts and some silicone selant to seal before each  
sailing? 
Or (thinking aloud) what about some perspex side windows which hinge 
into the hull, and a birdwatcher style canvas top?

What thickness of ply was enigma made of? 

Jeff Uk where abouts are you? Im in bradford yorkshire of all places!
Yours James
