My gut feeling is that Paradox is too small to be practical made of 
steel but I could be wrong. Bill you mentioned steel boats in Holland. How small did they get? Aluminum is another option bandied about. Sven prefers the expanded plastic substrates because they have a lot of bouyancy, are strong but flexible and don't rust.

Philip Bolger has a very interesting solo circumnavigator he has designed to be built in steel. As someone mentioned it is built like a Sherman tank and looks like one as well. I think it is twenty feet and the designers say it would even be better at 24 and would be easier to build. 3/8" steel plate - any thinner and distortion becomes a factor.
