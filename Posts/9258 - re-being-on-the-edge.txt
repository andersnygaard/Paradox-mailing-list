So there were no women at that destination, after all, Deric? Ah, well, at least you had you boat for company and I can see, she had a few surprises in store for you!

Somewhere in that delightful prose, I inferred you had a bad Chinese gybe which you were unable to rectify on the water. I suffered a few of those, one 500m upwind of rocks leaving me no option but to clamber on deck and sort it out. That experience galvanised me into ditching the standing lug for the four sided sprit rig I now use.

Great story by the way.  I can relate to most of what you've recounted.

Cheers,

Rob.
