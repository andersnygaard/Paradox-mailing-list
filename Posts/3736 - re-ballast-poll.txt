Don't buy it, get it given to you. I ended up with 17 lead bricks weighing 25 lb each for the price of 2 pints of beer.

If over there is anything like here the places that fit tyres will have buckets full of old wheel balance weights which they pay someone to take away. I only use 4 of the bricks now. it was much more to start with, but as I have added 'useful' equipment I have compensated by removing lead.
