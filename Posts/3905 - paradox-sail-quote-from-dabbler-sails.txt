Subject: Paradox sail quote from Dabbler Sails

For those of you interested in buying a well-made Paradox sail, I received this quote yesterday from Stuart Hopkins of Dabbler Sails:

"I have made two or three of these challenging sails. Currently, my price would be $600.00 in 5 oz white, or $700.00 in a color (cream, tanbark).  That is an exact quote. To include sailbag. Flat $25.00 shipping charge for UPS.

Currently I am mentioning quotes are valid for 30 days, because suppliers are adjusting prices more often to follow oil.

Admirable little boat -- I love the photo I have seen somewhere of one bellied out on a sand spit in the Bahamas.
