Hi Al

I've already done the panic bit but I'm over it now.

I've just realised that I missed you of my thank you list earlier (unless I pretend that the "et al" 
was you)  Aplogies you have been very helpful and I am looking forward to he first UK 
Paradox rally which may be two or three boats with leisure rich owners :0)

Cheers  ....   Derek
