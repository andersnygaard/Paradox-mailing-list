Subject: Re: Hatch mod stuff

But you were sailing with the hatch 'closed' anyway, weren't you? Would there be time to slide a stiff hatch closed even assuming the danger was recognised before it hit? How would an open boat have coped in the situation that you were in?

Over centre type clips would hold it closed and it could be held against a neoprene sealing gasket. In fact, the more I look at it, the better the sliding hatch looks. Is it a marked benefit of a sliding hatch that it can be closed in a hurry? This is a boat that is sailed from under cover in poor weather. Is the hatch intended, or able, to allow more than that? 

When ML got tipped over by a wave his hatch must have been open to allow him to fall out (I think that he fell out, I'm a bit hazy on this) but the boat righted itself. Surely that is the key thing; boat tips, boat rights. Once back upright she can be pumped out and progress continued. I think that if the hatch fits loosely enough to slide properly then it will ship some water if it is under long enough. If you are sailing with the hatch closed that will be minimal, and the same applies to any other reasonable design of hatch that is properly closed. If the hatch is open when you go over it isn't going to matter what type of hatch that you have.
