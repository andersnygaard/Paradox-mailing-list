Hello,

I was thinking about adding a database for this group to track completed Paradoxes. Things like year completed, builder, current name & location of the boat.

Pete's blog is very informative, but I don't think he ever intended his blog to do this. His blog is just so helpful, it fills all kinds of needs.

Is there a census already out there somewhere, and does it allow builders and owners to register changes? To make this longterm, it needs to be tracked at the group level.

Judging from the recent group photos, it appears we are entering an explosion of newly and nearly completed Paradoxes, which is fantastic.

Respectfully,
Bobby
