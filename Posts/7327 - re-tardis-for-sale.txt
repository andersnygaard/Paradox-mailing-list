Matt,

When I was building Smallfry I kept every receipt relevant to her construction, even for trival things like trips to Bunnings for yet more supplies of sandpaper... anyway it sat in a file collecting dust for some years, but recently during a major clean out I added it all up. The grand total was about $12000 including the trailer which was about $2000 of that. Not all boats would cost this much, I used all the best materials I could get my hands on, west system epoxy, marine ply throughout, international brand epoxy primers, epoxy undercoats, and epoxy top coats. Still, even if some cheaper materials were used in a paradox build, I suspect the overall price would be more than might be guessed. If a well built paradox comes up for sale, once you add the shipping cost to go half way around the world, it may still be a better option than building your own from a financial perspective. Having said that, I consider the building process to have been a fantastic life experience and I wouldn't give that experience up for the world. I get pleasure during every cruise knowing that the boat carrying me safely through all manner of weather and seas was built with my own hands.

Cheers,
Geoff (Smallfry, Fremantle).
