Rob,

Have you got room between the top of the tank and the deck where the pipe terminates to install a Ball valve? ThaT way you could leave it flush and open on deck. As to the breather tube, if there's a large temperature swing on the tank after filling you could have an issue. You can either design in a little air space in the tank to allow for water expansion, or do a second very small tube as a breather.

I've considered using a hand operated diaphragm pump to empty ballast tanks while afloat. It could double as your bilge pump with proper piping and valves.
