Hey, that sounds like a good option. I guess my only concern would be trashing the chine runners on rocks and stuff. I suppose that with enough glass they should hold up as well as designed. 

Incidently Glen, about how much lead ballast does Zoe use? Did your chine logs go in in single pieces, or did you laminate two pieces per side? Doug Fir?

I dry fit my sides/bulkheads yesterday. Looks great! I'm seeing a little puckering at the sheer and chine edges, from the compound curves no doubt. I went with the 5mm curve on both the transom, and blkd #4. I have complete confidence that the sheer clamps and chine logs will draw everything fair. I may have a little hard spot at the #4 bulkhead chine, so will remeasure and cast my eye again. I have yet to final fit the stem. So far, I have had no need to modify any bevels; everything is tight, and as fair as I expected at this stage. The stem will definitely require some bevel adjustment, as expected.

Hardware bonding rocks! It must have originated from some poor fool on a raceboat, who dented his skull on one too many acorn nuts. I am increasingly seeing hardware installed sans thru-bolts. Given a thick enough structure, it makes all the sense in the world. A concern of mine would be epoxy weakening because of the heat generated by direct sunlight on black hardware. For this reason, I would use an epoxy less affected by heat, than say the 1/2 ratio mixes. I'd have no problem with fully cured West System.
