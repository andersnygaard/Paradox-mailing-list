Well put, Derek.

There are those who scoff at weather forecasts and updates, but I view them as a valuable first step in storm tactics. It's best to avoid adverse conditions in the first place. I've seldom felt compelled to go to sea when static conditions are greater than 20 knots and 10 feet. To be sure, at times conditions will worsen while underway, but this serves to heighten one's threshold for foul weather, thus gaining valuable experience in an incremental fashion.
