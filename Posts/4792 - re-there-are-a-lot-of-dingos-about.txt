Hi Al, Bill.

NOLI is on hold at this moment due to the crappy weather, cold, rain and wind, but as soon as the weather pipes up work will continue.

Launch date, I am trying for June.

On the subject of propulsion, I still favour the Yuloh but not as drawn on Matt's drawing. I have been studying the more efficient Japanese VE-SCULL design which has a laminar flow.

Is there anything new here? Isn't this just building an oar to use the slalom stroke, rather than the falling leaf stroke used on Paradox? Or am I missing something?

Hoping for calm nights,

Al, Yeovil, England.
