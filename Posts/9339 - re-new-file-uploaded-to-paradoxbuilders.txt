Hello,

I thought it might be useful to those of you who are building or contemplating doing so, what it's actually like to own and sail in a Paradox. Lots of things have been written in the past that to me seem to paint the boat in an unrealistic light. A Paradox is just a boat after all and owning one won't suddenly transform you into a super sailor. That being said, I don't regret building her and I'm certainly not wanting to part from her. I just felt the time was right to write down some things I've learned about sailing a Paradox regularly over the last 13 months.

Cheers,

Rob.
