Subject: Re: Fanir or Paradox

Hi Rod,

I understand your frustration. I go through the same thing at times, however Fanir & Paradox are really two different boats, designed for two different reasons. I would suggest you make a list of your "mandatory requirements" in the middle of a page with Fanir pros and cons on one side & Paradox on the other. Then total them & may the best design win for your specific sailing needs. They are both great designs and I'm sure either will serve you well as long as you do your homework.

I have Paradox plans... I don't have Fanir plans (I wish I did) so I'm not being fair if I was to compare build plans. I really do love Fanair but just can't find the extra cash to purchase a set of build plans, maybe someday (dream, dream). For me personally... I have no problem giving up a knot or so for the safety of Fanir...however that's only my opinion. It's your money,...its your boat.... its your decision.

Kim
