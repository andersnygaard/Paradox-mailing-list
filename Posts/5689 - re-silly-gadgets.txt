Yes - Seems you can't really "win" no matter what you do. This generator
apparently puts out 20 Amps but I bet it is a lot harder to peddle!

I have a fairly large solar panel - about 14" wide and 40" long and it
produces only 15 watts under ideal conditions - which you hardly ever
get in real life. And I feel a wind generator  is useless unless you can
get the thing up at least 20 ft. above the water. It wont work at all
when sailing for the most part nor if you are in a snug berth.

I worked on a solar and  wind power research project for 4 years once.
Of course the wind mills ended up being over 60 meters above the surface
and located on a ridge.

Amazing the amount of potential energy in one small can of gas... err
petrol:-)

Back to the drawing board.
