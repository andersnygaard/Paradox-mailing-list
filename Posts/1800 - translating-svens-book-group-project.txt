Subject: Translating Sven's Book: Group Project?

Nels,
This is a good plan. There are ten chapters total, and Kjell has already translated one, so that leaves 9 to go. If have three people who are willing to translate three chapters each we could be close to ready to go! I would be willing to photocopy my book and send it to the translators.

I'm fairly sure Sven would give this his blessing, though he would probably want to approve the final translation. (He speaks English extremely well.) We would also have to get approval of his publisher, but that may not be so difficult because I think that if the book were translated I might be able to interest my publisher in printing it and they could handle the deal with Prisma.

Let me know,
Bill Longyard
