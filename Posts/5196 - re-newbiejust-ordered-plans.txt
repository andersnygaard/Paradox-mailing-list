Hey Dennis,

Check out this underwater power supply http://www.nauticexpo.com/prod/lvm/underwater-propeller-power-supply-generator-21773-52007.html.... it can be dragged behind the boat on a line and will start charging at 2.5 knts. I found one that outputs 4 amps at 3 knts. Also was thinking wind turbine could be mounted on mast at night with a little work in a mount.. I like the underwater cause I'll just bet if u found a fast stream or river u could anchor and let er charge in the current. hmmmm....

Got it that time Rodney, thank you, I've looked into this one for a Paradox, it might be a little to big to manage on the limited deck space available..

It is a nice unit though and it would charge batteries all night while you were laid up and waiting for some sunlight.

Denny ...

I know about the pedal charger, that might be ok to use, if for no other reason you probably wont get much exercise  on a Paradox while sailing.

I'm very interested in your small wind genny but the link didn't work for, I cut and pasted into my browser.

I would definitely like to see what you're talking about, sounds perfect for a Paradox.

Denny ...

Hi all,

My name is Rod Cannon and I live in Venice, California. I just ordered the plans for Paradox after weeks of deliberation over it or the "Black Skimmer" design. I chose Paradox hands down cause I am a bit of a gadget gizmo man and this craft is wonderous!

I will begin building in the fall and preparing to sail in the summer of 09'. I was a Professional Magician (specializing in micro-magic...heh) for over 20 years and I am an avid electronics geek. I want to apologize now for any cockamanie idea I come up with that is not feasable, be easy as I am new to boats and boating. (presently taking navigation and sailing classes in Marina Del Rey to get certified,) I plan on using this boat for very short distances next year until I feel capable. 

I have a couple of ideas to share later as to the electrical system in Paradox, but right now I was wondering if anybody has thought of using an electric motor instead of gasoline? I know a trolling motor might not be enough power but the technology has gotten better and I have seen all kinds of Micro-generators new to the market that might run an electric motor using way less gas than a standard. (a reg. genny 1000w will run approx 6hrs. on a gal. of gas) I found a seylar trolling motor for under $100 dollars on net that give 18 lbs. of thrust, I dont know enough yet about the subject but is this enough to move Paradox at least 3 knts?
