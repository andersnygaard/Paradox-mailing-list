Will do Bill, I would never go any where without at least two anchors (I use the 11 lb Delta Quickset) and generally three. What would you do if you lost one due to any number of possibilities like letting it get away from you, or having to cast off to avoid being drug down on by a larger boat ect. It is a good idea if the last is a possibility to have a float tied to your line so you can retrieve it later.

  Glen,

  How about adding to the list about anchoring and anchor stowage?  I'm 
  not sure how this is best done.  Do people usually have 2 anchors, a 
  bower and a kedge?

  There's a question about the materials list.  A list is present on 
  the CD distributed with the plans. Is it subject to copyright?  If 
  not, the list is ready-made.

  Dave and Matt will have the answer to the above question.

  Bill.
