I would wonder how tapered washboards would come out if the hatch overlaps the top of the opening?

My companionway has a tapered opening and I like it that way. One thing is that the washboard has delrin sliders that have some resistance but always slide easily with only a small bit of effort required. Never has leaked either. And it has a porthole installed in it.
