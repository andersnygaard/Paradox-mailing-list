Subject: Re: More pics

Great pics, but can you please upload pics to the files folders? The large pics that you post can only be viewed in a smaller resolution, that only the group moderator can see full-sized. For instance, in one of the pics:
Screen Size: 19 KB   |  Full Size: 366 KB 

All we can see is the 19kb size, so there is an additional 347 kb we will never see and sorely miss.

Thanks,
Paul
