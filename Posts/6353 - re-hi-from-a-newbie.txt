Hi Charlie
I'm 6ft and 18 stone of big lummox.I've sailed with Al in Little Jim and had no problems getting into,out of,or in any other way accomodating myself within the Paradox.
I've also done a bit of sailing in a S3 Silhouette.To be honest I feel the paradox has more useable space.Its an uncluttered rectangle with no bridge deck or cabin furniture/mouldings.The LWL's of the boats are almost identical.
Another attraction of the Paradox,for this big lummox anyway,is that  it is so shallow drafted that you don't need a dinghy.Some of my scariest moments have occured transferring between cruiser and dinghy,and the memory of a fall into the Penryn river,in November,at night, will live with me forever.
Silhouettes are gorgeous looking boats though.Good luck with your junk conversion.
Cheers Neil
