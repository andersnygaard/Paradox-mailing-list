Subject: Build restrictions?

I found out that in the state of CA. I have to register and obtain a hull number for my Paradox once it is built.  Does anyone know if there are any build restrictions here?  Or how about the name of the agency I am supposed to contact in regards to this?  Thanks in advance, I thought asking this question in the beginning might be better than later... lol.

Thanks again,
Rod
