I see your point Perry, Matt uses the rudder as part of the lateral resistance equation and therefore it is pretty far back. I remember building a Little Cruiser once and tried it out at Cedar Key. Matt was there as well and we discussed the pros and cons. His input was that he felt the Paradox design needed the larger rudder for increased LR.

Glenn,

Re:  the sail aspect ratio...

My first attempt at the junk rig design for the Paradox did have a 
higher aspect ratio, but it moved the CE of the sail forward of the 
center of lateral resistence of the hull.  I don't see how the rig can 
be  adjusted much from the final product that I posted without creating 
a great deal of weather helm to the boat.  I would appreciate your 
input.  Personally, I was amazed at how far Matt place the sail rig aft 
to begin with.
