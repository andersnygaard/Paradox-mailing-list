You were asking about a bigger Paradox. I don't know of anyone that has done that....but there are some folks that have made the Enigma in a larger version. Are you familiar with that?  I think that the original is the 360 and the larger is called the 460.  Not totally sure that is right but I think it is. There is an Enigma yahoo group as well.
