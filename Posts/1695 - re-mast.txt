Subject: Re: Mast

On page 12 of the plans you will find the specs for box mast.  I found post 1477, by Alastair, to be very helpful in deciphering the plans.  Now that I understand it, is seems obvious.  But without Alastair's "Rosetta Stone", I'd still be scratching my head.  Glen has posted some photos of his beautiful, bright-finished mast.  Offhand, I don't remember whether they are in Photos/Zoe, or if it is in Files where he talks about the topping lift he made.

Hope that helps,
Steve
