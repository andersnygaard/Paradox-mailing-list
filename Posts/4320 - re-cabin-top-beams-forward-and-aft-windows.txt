It's looking good, Jeff. We must try to get the whole fleet sailing together this summer.

I am intending to have my first outing of the year this weekend, launching at Calshot on Friday afternoon and spending Saturday night at Oxey Lake, so the rain forecast for Sunday will probably arrive on Saturday morning.

Hoping for calm nights
