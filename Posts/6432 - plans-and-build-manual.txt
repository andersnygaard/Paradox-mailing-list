Subject: Plans and build manual

I just received the plans from Dave and also Don Elliotts build manual from Wanda. I ordered and received them both in under a week . . so pretty speedy.

The plans package is very nice as expected.

But Wow, am I impressed with Don Elliotts manual. The illustrations, stories, and history lessons are worth it alone. I can also see that it will be invaluable as my building process begins. I would recommend this to anyone building a small boat for the hints and tips alone.

Just my two cents,
Tim
