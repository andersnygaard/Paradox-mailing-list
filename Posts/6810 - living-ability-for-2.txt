Hey guys,

Been looking a lot at the Paradox as my next build. The little boat with a lot of capability. The only thing that I am still not sure is about the interior (for 2). Not a lot of people have written or are using their Paradox 2 up...mostly are single sailing.

I will be sailing solo most of the times, but would like the option to take my wife along. I am also looking at the extended version of the paradox as an option.

One of the main reasons this boat will be the right fit for me is the ease of launch, has chine runners instead of centerboard/keel (nice for lagoons, etc.) and that I can sail the entire year and do not need to take off in winter due to rain and cold.

I will be mostly sailing at sea (in the bay) so will be mostly sheltered water. Won't sleep 2 up on the Paradox, but will sail occasionally 2 up. I have read Micro cruising by Dave and Mindi and this gave me some idea.

My question is this - What are your thoughts and experiences on sailing 2 up and would you recommend it?
