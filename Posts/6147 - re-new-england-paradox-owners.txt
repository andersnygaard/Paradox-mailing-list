Hi Dave,

Yes, I used biax on the bottom, 1 layer, I have not done any damage to it at all, the boat is just not heavy enough or gets going fast enough to damage it, 2 layers prob be a bonus, or you could go biax and a layer of 6 oz , or 2 layers of biax, but I feel one is fine, been a few years, still great. I also built a 19 foot flat bottom power boat, 1 layer of biax on that too, the only damage ive done to it is a few scratches, that happened one night I blew off the anchor and sailed accross the inlet and landed on the rocks for about 15 mins, oh god that was bad, but ended ok. I just mix up some epoxy and silica, fill the scratch and paint. I built my paradox the stitch and glue method, I just dont like nails in the endgrain of plywood, I flilleted and tabbed, very strong! when Matt designed and built his, it was years ago, epoxy has come a long way!! the paradox I feel was designed to be built from what materials are easily obtainable at the local hardware store, in its day... its a well thought boat. You would be hard pressed to find how to better it, seems everything in it, lends itself to the boat very well.
