Hi Pete,

If I am not careful you will be afloat before me :-)

I doubt that very much. There's an awful lot of work for me to do yet I think!

Looking at your dry assembly, I don't see why you could not build her stitch and glue with two layers making up the bottom panel or even just one thickness of 1/2".

My way of thinking in giving NOLI only a 3/8" thick bottom was that the original wooden  West Wight Potter had an even wider bottom and yet only had a hull thickness of 5/16" and these boats were designed to do the same things as PARADOX.

I suppose anything's possible, but I've purchased all the ply as spec'd and I'll just plod along and build as close to the design as possible. I've no doubt that S&G would be an option with a lighter build all over, but then the Enigma 460 would appear to be the option once the plans are ready. 

Cheers,
Pete

Just a thought.
