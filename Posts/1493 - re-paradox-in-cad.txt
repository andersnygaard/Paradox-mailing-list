Hi Paul,

I can see where a few of the panels don't quite match up and a couple other things, but it shows the overall shape and complexity really well. Did the chine runners show up about true to scale I wonder?

Also I am curious as to what input figures you need to create that type of diagram. The reason is that I have a much simpler design in mind as well and would like to be able to present it to everyone in such a fashion as this - to get people's feedback.

Thanks, Nels
