Subject: Re: Vane Gear was: Main sheet

Not completed yet Rod, I have not been satisfied with the light air performance so I've added more area to the forward portion of the servo blade to make it easier for the vane to turn it and increased the power output of the vane blade in an effort to keep from increasing the size of the vane, which is now plywood. Unfortunately I havent been able to get away from the house to try it out due to my wifes illness which requires some one to be with her at all times. The few times my daughter has come over with out her kids the weather has been either terrible or no wind at all or too much for the test I want. I wish I could take off for a few days but that doesnt look like it will happen until some time in November when my brother will return from the frozen north for the winter with his darling wife, she is more like a sister then sister-in-law, and help out with the wifes needs. Take hart I havent shelved the project just delayed the finish.
