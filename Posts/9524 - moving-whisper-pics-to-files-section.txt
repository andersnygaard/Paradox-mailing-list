Subject: moving Whisper pics to files section
Date: Sat, 21 May 2005 14:23:38 -0000

I noticed that the Whisper pics are quite large taking up 47% of the alloted meg space. But the pics only show at 15k in size. Some of these are about 900k, because Yahoo reduces them and only allows the original poster and the groups moderator to see them full size. Can they be moved to the files section so the others can see the full size pics?

Thanks,
Paul
