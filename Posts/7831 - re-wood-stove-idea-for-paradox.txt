Subject: Re: Wood Stove Idea for Paradox

I was looking at the design and thinking it was too much stove for the confined space of a Paradox, especially considering it is fully insulated. An open hatch might be necessary, not to mention it reduces the chance you will asphyxiate yourself.

I guess the way to know is to try it. You will still have to provide combustion air, so an inlet pipe would be the answer If the Paradox vent isn't enough.
