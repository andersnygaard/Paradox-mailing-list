Hi Cathy, welcome onboard.

Others have answered you already, but as you have seen, I am building my boat in a very small space, about 16' x 7'.

Like Al, I also keep the boat on a trolley. It's really the only way i can get access all round, and it does alow me to wheel it outside to make things more convenient for some jobs. Saying that I reckon 95% of the work ahs been performed indoors.
One thing you need to plan, is the logistics of cutting and storing your materials. I actually have a garage where I store all my tools etc. but it's full to the brim with other assorted junk. Here in the UK garages tend to be very small, for instance the reason there is no car in the garage is, that although a car will fit in, you can't get out of it because there is no room to open the doors!
I've therefore had to fabricate larger items outside, e.g. scarfing the bottom panel, and I will be building the spars outdoors as well.
This is my first build, and this forum has been invaluable when I run into problem areas. There is a wealth of experience here and most questions have already be answered in previous posts.

Please ask if you have any other questions, someone will be ready with the answer.

Regards

Pete
