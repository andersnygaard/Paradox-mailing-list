Subject: Re: Minimalist sail-inside designs

For a pd racer with a cabin look at the youtube video of Jason Nabors Tenacious Turtle.
I think chine runners are the easiest leeway preventer to build.I had a leeboard break.I'm not sure how well chine runners would work on a box boat.
A light boat like this is very easy to manoever on a small trailer.It is much easier than cartopping if you sail alone.
