Subject: Re: Transom ventilation Port

It hadn't occurred to me that you would take the cover off while sailing. Mine comes off to load/unload the spars for transport, but stays on the rest of the time. I get more than sufficient ventilation through the tiller slot

To be sure that I didn't lose the cover I drilled a small hole near the centre and put a knotted string through it.

Hoping for calm nights
