As double rudders are of use only if a boat sails at an extreme angle, PARADOX we are led to believe sails at 10# to 20# this thread is a waste of time.

The engineering is much to involved, also one of the rudders would foul the hatch that allows the spars to be placed inside the hull.

Don't forget the rudders would have to cant out and as the transom is small this would not leave a lot of room for the linkage. What a nightmare that would be.

As a Director of VectaVane Ltd. which manufactures the lightest servo pendulum self-steering wind vane on this planet, and as much as I would like to sell more, fitting a wind vane to PARADOX is a waste of time(I hope my other Directors are not reading this)as the boat clearly, as Matt and other PARADOX owners that and that have sailed in one found she steers a straight course by herself.

Remember Matt won the EC by sailing off shore and allowing PARADOX to take care of her and him self.
