Hi everyone,

I've finally uploaded some photos to the photo album. Thanks Glen, for the help in extricating my head from my butt, regarding photo uploads.

My boat's name is Swash, which comes from among other things, "the sound of water," "swagger," and the USGS' acronym for "Survey Wide Area SHorelines," which I thought particularly well-suited.

I've been a bit lax in my photography lately. I've so far managed to build a giant skateboard after Al's musings about the possibility of using his son's. My cradle is built of 4x4 timbers and 5" swivel casters. Swash's bottom is on and she is right-side up in my garage, while the rain commences for the winter. I've been prepping the interior for foam board, which I hope to begin installing in a week or so. Generally, I've been enjoying the work, and while I am excited to think of launching, I'm not in a hurry.

It's looking great.

You seem to have cornered the market in clamps. To any builders out there who are suddenly worried, fear not. I built mine with only 10 clamps of assorted sizes. Mind you, yours looks as if it is going to have a better finish than mine; that doesn't mean it will sail better of course :)

Hoping for calm nights,

Al
