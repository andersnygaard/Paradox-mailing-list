Depending on how wet the ply is, you should allow up to several WEEKS for it to _really_ get dry. A shortcut is to use a heat lamp for a week or so. I would also do what I could to see if there's a void in the plywood in any suspect areas that might be attracting/holding liquid. I have heard that by tapping, one can sometimes hear a difference (even when filled with liquid) and that voids will show up on a hull when it's covered with dew due to differences in heating/cooling.

If you're going to grind off all the epoxy, I wonder if one of these moisture barrior coatings that are now available is worthwhile - or some of this penetrating epoxy i've heard/read about. I think I would use either of those for sure on new construction.

Are you the guy who's going to put kevlar on his bottom? I'm interested to hear how that goes. From what i've read, kevlar is a royal PITA to work with. It's supposedly really hard to properly wet-out, extremely hard to cut (i've heard of special scissors, knives etc. needed to work it), and basically can't be sanded at all.
