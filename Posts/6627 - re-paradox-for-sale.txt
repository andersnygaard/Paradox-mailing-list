Strewth! Can't believe you're selling. Surely you could put Zoe onto the Tanton's foredeck and leave the liferaft behind. 43? Really? That's pretty big. Sounds like a lot of work that you'll be trading Zoe for. Anyway, you've obviously thought long and hard about this. Good luck to you in your new adventure. Zoe is easily the best example built, but your asking price is only enough to cover raw materials. Whoever buy's Zoe will be getting a bargain, that's for sure. Thanks for the inspiration you provided to the rest of us during our various builds.

Cheers,
