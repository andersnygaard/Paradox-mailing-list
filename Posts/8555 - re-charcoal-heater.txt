Subject: Re: Charcoal Heater

Solid fuel stove

When my youngest read these posts he became apoplectic.
Until I pointed out that both Jim and Brian knew exactly what they were doing.

They both know that all fuel burners release carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide:  this includes charcoal,  wood,  paraffin (kerosene),  gas and Dylan Winter's candles-under-a-flower-pot.   Neither of these gases can be smelt,  tasted or seen,  and they both kill without warning.   Jim's "evil smoke" is far less dangerous;  it's visible and smelly.

The purpose of the flue and/or chimney is to carry the gases and smoke out of the boat.   The vent lets in air to fuel the stove and (we hope) dilute the gases.
The carbon monoxide alarm tells them when their burner is not working properly.

Both Jim and Brian also know that burners get hot;  sometimes very hot.   Heat could ignite their plywood and their epoxy resin.   Resin burns more fiercely than plywood (hot enough to melt the glass in the mat) and releases black,  very toxic smoke.

Sailing has its risks,  too!
As does living.

Thanks Jim.

I plan to go shopping this weekend and see what I can find.  I'll check the dollar store first for tiny SS bowls and then the hardware store to see if they have any short scraps of 2 or 3 inch copper pipe.

I think the 2" would probably be plenty for my tiny boat but a slightly bigger heater might still be an option.  One candle ISN'T enough to heat my cabin but MAYBE if I could fit a few tea light candles inside the little heater it would be worth a try.

Another idea is to use black iron pipe fittings.  Sure it would rust but everything else on this boat is built cheap so it would likely outlast the boat.

P.S.  Sorry about your assistant.
