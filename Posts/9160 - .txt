Subject: Re: [Paradox] Refinishing the topsides

Hi Chris,

Sadly, I had the same job to do a couple of years ago on my Paradox ABIota. It was a major pain, couldn't find any shortcuts. Razor blade scraper seemed to be the best tool IIRC. Then rough sandpaper. Please post if you find a better way!

Also, the second Paradox I bought was like yours and had an open rear cabin. I finally closed it up and rebuilt it according to plan. Was just too hard to keep waterproof and weakened the cabin too much in my opinion.

Good luck with your refit.

André
