So the haulyard goes down to the yard from the snap shackle
Around the double block on the yard
Up to the single block here atop the mast
Then back down to the yard
Back up through the block in the mast top and down to the cabin
It needs a lot of rope, lots!
Rope that occupies the cabin floor
I will re-design it some day soon
I am thinking of using a very large sheave in the mast, as big as I can buy
And I've changed the pulley in the mast box to the biggest I could find already, it was expensive and hard to refit

Small pulleys drag on rope and add a lot to effort needed to raise the sail.

I'm sporting a damaged shoulder so while it's healing I need this sort of "crane jib" run of pulleys and ropes
Once I've sailed it and get the hang of trimming the sail I'll re-design this
Back to as close as possible to the plan
Keeping to the plan is paramount to me
It allows proper discussion of typical problems and fixes
It adds value to a well-built boat too

I deviated from the designed mast in one MAJOR way
My mast is round
A so-called birds mouth mast, made from 8 tapered pieces of beautiful hoop pine
It's hollow and terribly strong, light too.

I did this for one simple reason
"because I could"
I have always wanted to make one
Silly I know, but I love it

Hope your toiling away at the rigging soon
I always have heartache rigging for the first time
The modifications then come easier

Just to check
Are all your ropes running free and straight
Do any rub on soars or bulkhead?
Sorry for such a dumb question, but a rope twisting slightly along a spar once caused me hell
I re-rigged it so the rope ran straight and it was fantastic to use then
