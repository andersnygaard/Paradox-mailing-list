Subject: Steering Line Blocks

I've been playing around with the positioning of the steering line blocks today. Matt shows the f'wd blocks suspended in mid air right in tight to bulkhead 2!

I seem to get a reasonable line up if I mount the f'wd blocks low down on the intermediate deck between Bulkheads 1&amp;2. I can't seem to find any photo's showing how others have placed these blocks (rear ones aren't a problem) so would be interested in any pointers/advice as to what does and doesn't work.

Once I get that sorted I can finally glue my decks on!
