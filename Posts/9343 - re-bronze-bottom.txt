The way I see it anything that pierces my hull anywhere is going to allow water to seep in and in the long term rot it. I followed the plans and used bronze ring shank nails into the chines, but now wish I had used the method I used on my previous boat, which was square drive wood screws to hold the wood while epoxying and then removing them and filling and taping over the holes.

Anyway, back to your question, all the grounding wear to the boat is going to occur on the chines not in the centre of the hull, so I can't see the bronze plate doing much apart from reducing your need for lead ballast.  In practice, the many layers of epoxied cloth specified on the hull bottom in the plans, will protect the hull and I have never found that the nose gets damaged while using my boat, probably because I approach landings at a snail's pace.

I never leave my boat beached, if there is an alternative.  It's more comfortable to sleep on when afloat anyway and avoids rubber-neckers.

Another thing to think about is future maintenance.  You're going to have to repaint your boat sometime in the future.  As per plans, you can remove all the internal fittings, including the lead ballast.

Cheers,

Rob.
