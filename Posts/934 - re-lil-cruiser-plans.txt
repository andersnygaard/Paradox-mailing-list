That is true for the classic Sharpie shape. Paradox falls into that class.

There are other types of Sharpies. Modified or NonPareil Sharpies have a slight "V" bottom, and Huntington Sharpies have a slightly rounded bottom in length and beam. These were developed to reduce pounding in short, steep seas while still maintaining the inexpensive nature if the type. Reuel B. Parkers Sharpie books have a good discussion of them, and his second book deals mostly with them.

A Paradox probably won't pound much, because it sits relatively deep in the water and has a greatly rockered bottom so that seas won't  get a "bite of a 
large flat surface. I have built sharpies with much less rocker that really flew but were not heavy weather boats and couldn't carry the loads that a Paradox can. I foound that a rarched bottom helped with one of those boats.
