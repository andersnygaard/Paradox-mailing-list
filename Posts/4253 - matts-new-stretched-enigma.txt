Subject: Matts new stretched Enigma

I'm sure this will interest some on here.
Posted on the Enigma Group


Matt has designed a 4.6 meter version of the Enigma. I am building a prototype here: http://e460.blogspot.com/

Plans should be available once the E460 is completed and proven. 

Matt reconfirmed his intention to produce plans for the original Enigma (Enigma 360)in the near future. (:-)
