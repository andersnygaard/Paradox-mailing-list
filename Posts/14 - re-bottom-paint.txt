Hi Chuck, 

Feel free to use this tip in Duckworks. After all the fairing is complete (usually micro balloons or spheres) a sealer coat of clear epoxy should be applied. It is to this sealer coat that the bottom paint is applied. I have never had a problem with topside paints flaking but I do use a primer under them unless I am using varnish.
