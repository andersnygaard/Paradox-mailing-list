Subject: Paradoxes afloat

Hi all,

How many Paradoxes are now afloat? Does anybody know the names of the boats and their owners' names and nationality? If I start with the ones I can think of, can others complete the list, please?

There are the 8 I can think of, but I thought there were more. How many are under construction and where?
