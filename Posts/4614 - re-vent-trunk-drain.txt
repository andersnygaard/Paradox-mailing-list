Subject: Re: Vent Trunk Drain

Pipe sizes in the USA are very strange. A "pipe" size means something very specific and should should not be confused with "Tube" size. A one inch "PIPE" measures on the outside diameter 1.315 inches. Or 33.4 millimeters. I have a whole chart of these sizes if you need more help. Cheerfuly, Steve Yahn

Matt specifies 1" dia pipe for the VT drain.
Here in the good old UK, standard PVC plumbing comes in 22mm, 32mm and 
40mm size. I have a length of 22mm left over from my last bathroom refurbishment which I was considering using, but too be honest, it looks a bit small for the job in hand. If one were to ship a load of green water, I could imagine the VT filling up quite quickly. Would a 22mm pipe be adequate to keep the VT empty under such conditions? Should I go for 32mm which I reckon will just about fit if my drilling is accurate enough?

Thanks
