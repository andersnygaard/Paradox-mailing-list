Ok.... thanx Al, it's making more sense to me this morning. Just one more question and this one relates to basic woodworking knowledge .. I guess. Just how did you guys shape the wood for these parts? All I have is hand tools, skilsaw, jigsaw, belt sander and drill are the extent of my powertools. I do have fences for both skilsaw and jigsaw. And an excellent set of chisels. And how do I determine the radius of the rounding of the corners? I mean how do I make the wood round to that measurement?  Sorry to be a pain, (musta skipped these days in woodshop)   Rod


Most of my wood removal was done with a hand plane or a coarse sanding disc in an angle grinder (almost as fast as a power plane, but not bothered by epoxy or the odd nail).

I bought a roll of sanding paper (1 inch wide) and found that a couple of feet of this, held at each end over the corner and the ends pulled alternately, produced a very smooth curve (and removed a surprising amount of wood). I made up cardboard templates for the various sections to see that I was somewhere near the right size.

Hoping for calm nights
