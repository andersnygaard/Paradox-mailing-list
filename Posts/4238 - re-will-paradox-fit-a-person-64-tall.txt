It all probably depends on the relative size of your body and legs.

The only times that height would be a problem are when sailing inside with the hatch shut and when sleeping. You say you are not bothered by sleeping, but it would be a simple matter to modify the access to the forward stateroom so that your legs could go straight through. I reckon this would accommodate someone up to 8ft.

When I am sitting with my back flat against a wall the top of my head is 890mm from the floor. When sitting upright in the Paradox there is 35mm between my head and the 20mm thick foam lining the hatch. If I slouch to my usual sailing position there is about 100mm clearance.

It would be a simple matter to make the hatch 50 or even 100mm deeper if that would help. Another possibility is to lower the floor.

I am only 5ft 6inches tall, but I have had someone who was "over 6ft" (I don't know by how much) sail Little Jim as he had the same worry. He didn't find it a problem.

The only times I sail with the hatch shut is when it is particularly rough/windy or when it is actually raining. If it is just cold then sitting inside with the hatch open is sufficient to keep warm.

My own personal feeling is that, given the choice, for the few occasions when the weather is inclement, I would rather be cramped than wet and cold. Fortunately I don't think you have to be either.
