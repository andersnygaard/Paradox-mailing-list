Subject: Re: Small Jib ???????

I put a jib on one of Matt's chine runner models, and I found that the boat pointed a few degrees higher. I'm not sure that it's worth all the fuss, but it should be fun to try it out anyways.  Believe it or not, Matt tinkers alot too, and I think he tried a spinnaker on one of his cruisers.  I'm pretty sure this happened because I found the remains of this sail aboard Little Cruiser when I first got her. I ended up using the lightweight nylon from this sail to make a really nice windscoop.
