I wonder if the bow entry is more critical on a lighter boat.

I have never been aware of slap while sailing my Paradox, I have observed slap while being towed.

I presume the lack of slap when sailing is due to the boat heeling and presenting a "V" entry to the water.

It occurs to me that angling the bottom board at the bow may reduce slapping when the hull is upright but may promote slapping when the hull is heeled.

If I were going to test this (which I am not) I would carve a foam block to simulate the new shape of the bow and bond it to the hull, and see what the effect was.
