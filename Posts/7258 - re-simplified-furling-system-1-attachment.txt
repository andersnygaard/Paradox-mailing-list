Subject: [paradoxbuilders] simplified furling system?

I was researching how people had made their tack strop, and how to bend the curved piece, and noticed Tony Bigras' "Miss Cindy" has a system claimed to be similiar to Paradox, but it has fore and aft topping lifts, and only a short line in place of the tack strop. Then I noticed that some here, have fore and aft topping lifts. So my 
question is, is the metallic tack strop needed in such a case? 

Tony also has eliminated the curved pice, and simply uses a strap, similar to the way some of you attached furling straps to the aft topping lift at the end of the boom. So I'm just wondering if Tony's system is an alternative to the Paradox method, or does it add complications, because it is not so easy to drop the boom on deck, to get the mast down? Or are their other configuation changes to his sail setup he made to get his system to work?

Not that I want to change anything, but just curious.

Here are some links to pics of his setup:
