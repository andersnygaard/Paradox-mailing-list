So Peter, How long does your epoxy paint take to start chalking? We all 
know that epoxy paints are the best type of paints for durability and I 
always use them for undercoating but I personally have never seen one 
that could hold a shine for more than about 18 months at best and most 
only 6 months where as the urethanes and especially Awlgrip, Emron and 
the likes are good for at least ten years. What say you.
