Since sand weighs about 100 pounds per cubic foot vs water's 65, why not make up 8 SAND & WATER TIGHT bags that weight about 20 pounds each when filled with sand? Take a few minutes to fill them before launch, stow them after launch to trim out the boat, and dump them while waiting to use the ramp.

Make them the right diameter and the lid will help hold them in place.
