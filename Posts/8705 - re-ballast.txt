Perhaps the cleverest thing to do with an aerorig is not rig an aerorig. Has anyone tried a cambered junkrig on any of Matt's boats? The cambers erasing the to windward deficits of the old school flat junksail.

To fit a Bermudan rig you'd need to add shrouds and stay(s),
unless you did something clever with an aerorig (which you can Google).
To add leeboards you don't necessarily need to remove the chine runners: just add battens for the boards to bear against clear of the runners.

No sign of shrouds, so it must be difficult to get any luff tension

Hi Nick,

You are not the first one tempted to use bermudan rig on Paradox. Here
is a photo of one http://ftp.ij.net/wctss/wctss/photos107.html

] I have earlier done some research on this and found out that first
the chinerunners were removed, later a leeboard was attached, so there
is no way back. Just for information...
