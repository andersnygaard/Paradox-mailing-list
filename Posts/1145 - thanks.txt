Subject: Thanks

Dear all,

I just received my plans from Dave and Mindy and the articles "Building Paradx" from Don Elliot. I just wanted to thank them all for their promptness in delivering them to me. I also would like to thank everyone who has contributed pictures as they are a big help. I am looking forward to beginning construction on my own small cruiser.

Best regards,

Ken Riggins
