Hi Sybe,

You can build most of the runner beforehand as I did, but the runner is wider than the hull bottom, so you can't do the whole thing. As I recall (it's surprising how quickly you forget the building phase once the sailing phase begins), I built the runners out to the same width as the hull bottom first with several fore and aft strips of timber laminated together in a stepped sequence, put the bottom on and then ran a couple of stepped strips fore and aft at the same depth as the hull bottom. I did the final shaping of the chine runners after the bottom was installed with a block plane and later coarse sand paper. It took me a while, but I didn't bother getting it perfect because after I had filled and faired it with epoxy and covered it with several layers of cloth, nobody is any the wiser!

Cheers,

Rob.
