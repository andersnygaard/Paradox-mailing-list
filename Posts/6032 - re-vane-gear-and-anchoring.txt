Thanks Al. 

I made a little wooden clamp to hold an umberella. It was a godsend in the high heat of the day. Also, I see now after this trip I need to make a lock-clamp for the steering line. I also need to do something to better grip the sole hatches when I need to lift them. I also need to put up a better wind indicator on top of the mast. The anchoring scheme you described to us worked nicley for me too, Al. My outboard motor trouble was just a dirty spark plug. It was a good shakedown cruise.
