I would just like to share that Jim Michalak designed a 16 ft. hull with several of the attributes of the AS29.

It has an inboard rudder with end-plate almost exactly the same as the AS29 - which also allows the motor to be installed on the center line in it's own free flooding well. Very much a motorsailer.

Instead of bilgeboards, it has a single off-set external board and provision for a bow centerboard.Instead of a gaff rig it has a balanced lug with control lines running inside the shelter below deck.

It has an open slot-top cabin amidships giving a living space 51/2 feet wide, 8 feet long and 41/2feet deep.

To me it would be an ideal candidate for chine runner experimentation as well as the roller reefing sail plan like on Paradox.

Still a prototype, so Jim does not advertise the plans which are available from him directly for 25 bucks.

I have not looked into further though as my goals have gone off into another  direction.
