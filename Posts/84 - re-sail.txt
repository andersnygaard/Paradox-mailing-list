Hi David,

Sorry it took so long to get back to you on the sail. I wanted to send along a picture of the one I had made by Sails ect. in St. Augustine Fl. It cost me $420 US. I'm not so sure it was a great deal as I have heard of a sail maker up north who really knows how to build these small lug sails. I will try to find his name and number and pass it on. I know I paid a premium because of the tan bark material which comes from England. You can do much better if you have it made in white. Mine is 4.5oz Dacron. One important reason for the tan bark color is that it is much easier on the eyes. If you can find a sail maker who doesn't charge much difference for it you might want to consider it. Anyway below is the picture of mine, I can't comment on performance yet but maybe soon. Until then I can't recommend the sail maker. I will keep you posted.
