Subject: Re: Charcoal Heater

I was lucky to 'find' a short bit of 2 inch copper pipe for very cheap at a scrap yard. And I'm lucky enough to have welding equipment at home - oxy acetylene and electric.

If I was doing it again and without welding, I'd buy 2 cheap stainless steel bowls from the local bargain store. (they're like little dog feeding bowls and quite cheap). Bolt them together through holes drilled in the flanges and you have a basis for your little stove. 

But first, Brian, you need to make your Paradox so that you've got somewhere to heat.

I've just posted a picture of the chimney arrangement in the photo section. Sorry about the seaweed on the anchor line.

Best
Jim
