I may be missing some vital information, but are British conditions seriously different to US, Oz or NZ conditions? Do boats there go any differently to windward than they would here?

Heavy advertising, good salesmen and self perception. 

I'd be surprised if there is a second hand market here in the UK. Odd craft don't sell well. I spoke to a guy a few years back who had spent about =A34k building a Bolger Micro and sold it for =A31k with the trailer.
