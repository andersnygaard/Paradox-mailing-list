Subject: Re: Front Deck

Thanks Chris and Glenn

The two layer method sounds good if I can find two to make 9mm.

There is a distinct possibility that my deck beams are a little more curvaceous than the originals making quite a distinct hump across the boat between bulkhead one and bulkhead two. I think it looks kind of sexy but I wish I'd followed the plans more thoroughly!

Thinking about it further If I fit a separate piece of decking from the stem to bulkhead one (which is quite a flat area) I could shave the top of bulkhead two to ease the curve. Might be a plan.

My wife has suggested cutting the section of deck lengthwise down the middle and after fitting the two pieces filling the resultant gap. Naturally I scoffed and guffawed, but it doesn't actually seem a bad idea.

Any further thoughts? I am going to sheath the rudder today while thinking the deck through.

Thanks again  ......  Derek
