Subject: Re: Unfolding Calamity for Enuf

Don't panic! I too had a patch on the bottom that didn't set as fast as the rest. I painted it with hardener (which may have done some good) and left it while I did something else. It had hardened up a week later.

Do some work on the mast, or rudder or something and let nature take it's course (if you ignore it, like a "watched pot" it will probably cure eventually)

Hoping for calm nights
