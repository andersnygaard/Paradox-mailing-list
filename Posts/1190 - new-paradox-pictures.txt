Well, we finally got our hands on a film scanner, and we are slowly digitizing all our boating pictures. At the moment we have two new pages of Paradox pictures which many of you will enjoy. We just posted them at: http://www.microcruising.com/paradox3.htm and http://www.microcruising.com/paradox4.htm. Hopefully, we'll be posting some new updates to the website too.
