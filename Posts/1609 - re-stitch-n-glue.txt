Yes, in some of his designs the plastic is larger than the opening and attached to the outside with bolted gaskets. 

And if you want a belt and suspenders design you can have another layer on the inside that is held as you say - with wing nuts on the extended ends of the bolts. These inner panels can be transparent or plywood, or a mixture of both.

They will also add a lot of insulation and cut down on condensation, and noise. He also uses "Wiley windows" that can be opened and yet keep spray out. Of course another innovation is the "Birdwatcher top" which catches the downdraft from the sail and sends it into the cabin.

The JOCHEMS schooner is the prime example oo this.
