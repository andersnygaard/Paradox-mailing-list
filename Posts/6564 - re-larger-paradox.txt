Caroline was specifically designed for blue water, albeit coastal cruising off Maine, which is not the most friendly coast.

Looks like it tows fine with a smaller vehicle.

It would be on my short-list for a larger Paradox consideration. But not for heavy duty ocean going sojourns. Although it could be beefed up with a hard slot cover and on-centerline engine location. The original builder felt it motored very well.

I think three have been built so far and have very happy owners.
