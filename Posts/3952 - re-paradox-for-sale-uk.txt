Derek,

I'm sorry to hear about the limitations that diabetes has imposed on your sailing in Enuf. It's good to hear you have a backup plan.

If, after due time, a buyer does not materialize for Enuf, I'd be interested in talking with you about buying your MarkII sail.

Though I'm in the middle of the USA, my son is studying at Oxford this year, and has offered to be a broker/agent, if needed. I hope that Enuf finds a good, new home with a worthy owner. However, if this does not come about, send me a note and we'll talk.

I wish you happy motoring once your new project is complete. Well, once it is sufficiently ready, I wish you happy motoring..I think no boat is ever fully complete.

Steve H.
