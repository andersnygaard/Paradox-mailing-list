Well I've had a busy weekend, and real sawdust has finally hit the floor (and just about everywhere else).

A lot of Saturday was spent scratching my head trying to fit Bulkhead 2, the transom, and the forward side panel on one sheet. After lots of drawing and rubbing out, I decided the only way I was going to get it right was to cut out the bulkhead and transom first then make the other side panel and use that as a template for the "hard to fit sheet". I eventually managed all that (and boy was that a tight fit - not a single mm spare wood). So now at close of play today I have Bulkhead 2, two forward side panels and the transom cut out. I also have Bulkhead 3 and the 2 aft side panels marked and ready for the saw.

Which leads me to my next dilemma. I just rough cut the transom last night ready for finishing today, but when scanning this group last night I came across this message:

I discovered that while the transom is shown with camber on it's side panel edges, the camber was not specified. I incorporated 5mm of camber to these edges, as well as the side panel edges of bulkhead #4.

I've marked my transom with straight sides. Is this right? Should I add 5mm camber to it and Bulkhead 4? I'd like to get these finished during the week.

Tommorrow I'm going to rip some strips of 6mm marine ply and build a deck beam. If this is solid enough I will use marine ply for all the others.

Another question. I've got quite a bit of stock kiln dried pine. I don't think it's normally recommended for boat building, but would it be any good for side and bin cleats etc.? If not I'll pick up some douglas fir at the weekend.

Thanks
