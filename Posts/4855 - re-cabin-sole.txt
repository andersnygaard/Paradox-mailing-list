Hi,

Have just been doing the sums, ply wood weight is 25lbs per 1/4" sheet. Which means 3 sheets equivalent for bottom and three for sides and decks, 6 sheets =3D 150lbs or 75KG add 10 peices of timber, for chines, frames etc =3D 100kg or 220 lbs which I think is not unrealistic. If one makes the system of loading such that one only lift the bow or stern, individually and you have stops off each end of the rack cross bar. I think it is do able! If not I will be trailering it!

I will not be fitting most of the non structural inside stuff, at first either, so as to see what I need first. Bouyancy and ballast will be 5 and 20liter continers.

Yours James
