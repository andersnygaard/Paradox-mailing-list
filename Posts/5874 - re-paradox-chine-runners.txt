Subject: Re: Paradox Chine Runners ?

LOL no I have a swing keel but no chine runners. However I often sail shallows with the keel cranked up and it will track well on the hard chine like I explained, because the edge forms a vee in the water which tracks straight. My boat only draws 11 inches with the keel up.

 Matt Layden tried keels on his earlier designs. Then he figured out that a Paradox rarely sails flat because it is small and the wind will make it heel one way or another. He came up with chine runners to extend that aspect and emphasize it, forming a psudo skeg when that chine is downward.
