Ya, I thought it would create alot of drag for a small boat. (underwater prop genny) But it would be nice in a stream or small river when anchored in for the night. I also thought about only using a wind turbine at night or when not actually under sail but when sitting, it could be mounted on the mast with mainsail put away on a special mount .... maybe? When you look at some of the wind turbine models it looks to me that most of the blades are bolted onto the chasis and could be untightened and blades folded or removed for storage. I think these xtra things could be used in the rare times when solar is almost enough.

Hey Dennis,  check out this underwater power supply http://www.nauticexpo.com/prod/lvm/underwater-propeller-power-supply-generator-21773-52007.html.... it can be dragged behind the boat on a line and will start charging at 2.5 knts. I found one that outputs 4 amps at 3 knts. Also was thinking wind turbine could be mounted on mast at night with a little work in a mount.. I like the underwater cause I'll just bet if u found a fast stream or river u could anchor and let er charge in the current. hmmmm.... 

I notice they don't tell you what the drag is. I suspect it would slow you down quite a bit.

Hoping for calm nights
