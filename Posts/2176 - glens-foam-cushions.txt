Subject: Glen's Foam cushions

Welcome back Glen! A while back you posted some information on the laminated cushions you are using aboard ZOE. I wonder if you could elaborate on the type of foam you used and how you glued the two pieces together? We plan to replace our old bottomed out cushion foam aboard L.C.; therefore, this information would be especially interesting to us and probably quite a few others.
