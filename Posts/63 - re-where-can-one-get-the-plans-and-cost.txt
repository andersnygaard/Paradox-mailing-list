Hello David, 
 
You can learn more about Paradox at this site. (Mainly about using these small cruisers, be sure to check the photos and the file section)

The moderator, Dave Bolduc is the only person authorized to sell plans for Paradox, they are amazingly inexpensive about $35 but that may be an old price.
