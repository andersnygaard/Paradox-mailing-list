Well done Gunter.
Glad the epoxy rash has settled down.
I began building SaSa same time you started your Paradox Manatee, but I have fallen way behind your build.
All those dowels protruding here and there about the hull of Manatee early in your build appeared very purposeful.
For me building the hull was fairly straight forward, I am quite good at straight forward. But complications and subtleties such as steaming I replace with brute force.
It took me a week and a half of brooding about the Paradox cabin or coach house structure. And what I've done, does, to my relief, look somehow like the Paradox cabin structure.
I'll place some photos if I can remember how that's done.
