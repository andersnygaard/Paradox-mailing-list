Subject: Re: Paradox Vs Enigma 460

I agree with Jeffrey. The Paradox is much heavier, using thicker plywood, more bulkheads and essentially having a double bottom. The 460 should be much easier to build.I have a table giving the dimensions side by side on this page:

I asked George about the length of the 460's main cabin and he told me it is 7 feet 7 inches long. 

I don't think either of these boats will making sailing comfortable for a couple, although Dave and Mindy have been able to sail Little Cruiser many miles together. I think the advantages of the Paradox and 460 outweigh the cramped space for 2 people. I view the 460 as the latest evolution of Matt's designs, incorporating the best of his previous boats.

I have put together a page explaining the advantages of Matt's designs here: http://aiki.pbworks.com/Advantages-of-Matt-Layden-mini-cruisers

Enjoy!
