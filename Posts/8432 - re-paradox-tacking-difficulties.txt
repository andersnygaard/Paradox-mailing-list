Hi Dave B,

Many thanks for your carefully considered reply. I hear what you say about boat design being a compromise and on the whole I'm very pleased with my Paradox. Wonderful to be able to find a cosy spot to anchor in the shallows where the other boats can't go. And to be able to take a short cut across the shallows instead of slavishly following the marked channels has won me many an impromptu race with another boat.

The sluggish tacking - is to me - the only real shortcoming. Annoying when trying to beat into a narrow waterway. By the time that I've got the boat around successfully onto the new tack, then waited for the speed to build up again, its too late and I've lost  ground.

Ok if the wind is very light to use the yuloh instead of making very short tacks, but a sod to make much headway against a brisk wind.with this for an old decrepit chap like me.

The paradox is brilliant for living aboard. Easy to keep myself warm and dry, plenty of cabin space for lounging, comfy while at anchor.  Though I find it nicer to sail  when not heeled too much when in stronger winds. If heeled much more than 25degrees, thhe helming seat becomes uncomfortable for me as it tries to tip me to the lee side. Then I'm more comfortable sitting on the cabin sole inside, where I can wedge myself more effectively.   

That's all for now as it's my bed time here in the UK. Goodnight all.

Best,
Jim
