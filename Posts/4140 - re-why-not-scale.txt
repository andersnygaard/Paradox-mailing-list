Subject: Re: Why not scale?

When thinking of an upscaled Paradox I can't but think of the 
similar designs of Phil Bolger. Chosing one of his basic designs and 
improvising a way to use chine runners "ala Matt Layden" in place of 
Bolgers anti-leeway device. This way one might minimize the chance 
for dissapointment. Just a thought.
