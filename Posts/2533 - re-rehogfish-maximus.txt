Thank You Nels, for guiding me to the right spot. BTW is she a Bolger design? or if not, who designed it?

Thanks Aaron


" HOGFISH MAXIMUS"?


The tinyurl is only about hull comparisons with Paradox and has no Hogfish stuff in it. Look in the Filew folder "Larger Paradox" and "comp" file.

Then there are 3 photos in the Hogfish Maximus Folder.

Cheers, Nels
