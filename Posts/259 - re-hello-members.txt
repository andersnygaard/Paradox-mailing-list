Hi,

Sorry Dave! I read the posts in reverse order. I answered before I read your post. I didn't mean to contradict what you were trying to say! You are correct, this is a complex boat to build. As a first time builder I'm finding it difficult at times. I was lucky enough to find a Paradox already built, and studying this boat has answered a lot of questions on how this boat is built.

Thanks

David Beard
