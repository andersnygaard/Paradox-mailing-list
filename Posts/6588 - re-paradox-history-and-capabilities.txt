Subject: Re: Paradox history and capabilities

I would suggest that off-shore capability is very beneficial in a coastal cruiser. Sooner or later a sailor is going to want to make a jump over to a nearby island or cross a wide inlet or bay and these can turn into challenges as great as out on the ocean blue.

In fact Sven Yrvind states that coasts can be more of a threat than the open ocean, especially if caught upwind near an unfamiliar rocky shoal infested headland. This is where a hull like Paradox really shines since it can sneak into a shallow tiny cove and remain upright in the surf as well even if the tide goes out. And the crew are safe and dry inside if they have everything snugged down according to the designed set-up.

Phil Bolger suggested one time that the safest thing to do in a small design like this - if caught in a storm off a lee shore - might be to drop the sail, throw out the anchor and lie down in the lowest part of the boat. Of course if the boat is self-righting and shallow draft and water tight inside - like Parodox - you are already inside your "life boat"!

It's only real drawback is limited storage for long off-shore voyages.
