Subject: Glass over plywood - deterioration

Greetings Paradoxers,

I am thinking about buying a boat that is constructed very similarly to the Paradox: fiberglass and epoxy over plywood. The quality of construction seems good, but it's an older boat, over 20 years. I am a bit concerned about potential deterioration of the plywood underneath the outer layers. If at some point in time water penetrated and soaked in, and the outer layers were subsequently refinished, how would I know whether this has happened? Is it possible that the plywood underneath has rotted or delaminated, and that the hull will at some point fail catastrophically? If there is deterioration, is it possible to repair such a hull effectively? How does one tell when a boat constructed similarly to the Paradox has reached the end of its useful life as far as its hull integrity? What can one do determine whether the plywood is still intact?
