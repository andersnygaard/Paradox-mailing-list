<< -- Smaller lexan windows or backing supports for the windows, to lessen the chance of storm waves bashing them in.>>

This is only my opinion,

I am finishing up the interior of my paradox, and aside from being stitch and glue, I have gone from the "old school" steamed and bent, to laminated plywood epoxy impregnated, fast and cheap. after paint and triming out the interior I will move to the decking and cabin top, and the windows are a major concern to me. Im sure you could go with thicker lexan, Im not too hot on so many holes and screws making stress points. I think I am going to traditional framed locking rubber channel type of windows. also I will be epoxy filleting the cabin to the deck and then tab into the frames with cloth, this in keeping with the no nails or screws type of construction. This type of window makes replacement much much easier. One thing I havent decided on is the side window layout, one long, or two smaller. Also the rubber makes for a great gasket if you were to cover the windows with storm covers. 

If I was to only voyage when after checking conditions and deciding, hey its good enough to hit the seas in my paradox, then I would be more than happy with the stock window/cabin plan.

Now, if I was to plan a trip across the big pond and I am at Mom Natures mercy or a stray exocet missles path, I would want a bit better window system.
