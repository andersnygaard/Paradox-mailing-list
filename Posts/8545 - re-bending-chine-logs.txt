Hi fellas,

The discussion about bending chine logs has peaked my interest. I have done some steaming. The issue for me was that the wood cooled more than I was comfortable with before I got it clamped up.

Recently I saw this video on YouTube from Tips from a Shipwright about steaming wood in a plastic bag. The wood is bent into place and clamped while still in the bag under steam. Remember to replace the word dot after www in the address below.
