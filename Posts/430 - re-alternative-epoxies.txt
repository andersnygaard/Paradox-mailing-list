I've found if you use 100% fast hardener you can use RAKA at 50 degrees and even a bit below. Lots of blush, tho, and it might take two days to set up well if cold at night. I've also found that if I want to sand it, I should wait a week or so. This applies even in warm weather, at least when I adjust the cure for the temperature. It still clogs the paper, but not as bad. Robb White has an article on epoxy scraping as an alternative to sanding in April WB (ugh!). He uses a scraper similar to a cabinet scraper.

I have been using Raka all winter in Florida. 60 degrees seems to be an important ambient temperature. If you use the Raka below that temperature sometimes you have to wait days for it to get hard.
The slow hardener takes a couple of days anyway to get hard.
Over 60, the fast hardener will be like a rock in 24 hours.

I've tried a sample of the RAKA brand, and I found it a little too flexible and hard to sand for my taste. It seemed to gum up my sandpaper. Maybe I just mixed it wrong or used too small of an amount for the test. I will have to try it again.
