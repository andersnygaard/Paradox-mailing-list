Hi Jim,

I just PM'd you with some info.

For info, I bought my sail from Westaway Sails near Plymouth. They were one
of the few companies that actually responded to my request for quotes. It
was £450 when i got it 2 years ago.
I can't fault the build quality  and it fitted the spars exactly as
specified.. It uses the mark  2  sail dimensions.
Here's the contact details I have.

They did ask about yard stiffness in fact here is what I sent them:

OK I've supported the yard at it's extremities and hung a 10kg weight at
the very centre. I have measured the deflection at 5 points; Centre and
plus and minus 500mm and 1000mm. I'll call these points 1-5, 1 being
nearest the throat, 3 centre and 5 nearest the peak. These are the
deflections:
1 = 6mm
2 = 16mm
3 = 21 mm
4 = 20 mm
5 = 11 mm

Hope that helps.
Pete

Don't go to Quay Sails in Poole.

I remember Jeff Please writing that there was a place on the IoW that
knew about lug sails, but I can't find the post. Apparently they
should ask you how much the yard flexes so that they can take that
into account. Quay Sails didn't ask me and I had to fiddle about with
my sail to correct that error (if you look on my early pictures you
will see a nearly vertical crease in the upper part of the sail that
was the result).

When tacking in light winds at Seafair Pete, with his Mk2 sail,
seemed to be gaining on me so that may be the one to go for.
