Stephen,

I am not there yet of course...but... there is a sailmaker right across the street from where I go to get my Del Taco fix. I was gonna go in there and take the sailplan when I was ready to see what they said... Course at this rate, it will be next year before I need to talk to them for me. It would not be a problem to drop in by the end of this week however to see what they had to say if you want. It is one of the oldest companies in the Marina area so they may know what the hell they are doing. Just ask. I feel a Del Taco comin on anyway.

Did u try Sailrite?

I made my rod from .500 inch diameter stainless steel rod. I used an 
oxy-acetylene torch to heat and bend it. I am looking for a 
suggestion as to a good sailmaker. Any suggestions out there/ USA 
please. I may try a white tarp sail just to get going quickly. I 
already have just the right tarp too. Steve Yahn
