Brent,

Regarding the "metal angle", it is to be bent from a 2 by 25 strap. In American measurements, that would be 3/32" by 1" folded down its length. I personally have not used this, as I decided not to fit internal water tanks and didn't want anything in the side bins to drop into the bilges. I took the floor across to within a quarter inch of the sides, leaving a gap for ventilation, and my bin sides rest on the floor. I hope this helps.

Best regards,
Derek
