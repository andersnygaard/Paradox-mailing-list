I have two pieces of ply held together by a bolt and wingnut. One piece is V notched to hold the rope and the other is screwed by bulkhead 3. I insert the rope between the two pieces of ply and tighten the wingnut. The wing nut is held off the ply by a spring over the bolt so the rope is held firmly but can be pulled free of the clamp without having to undo the nut. It seems to work but I wasn't confident enough to use it for long. I felt much more in control with the tiller rope in my left hand and mainsheet in my right. In fact, I don't like the tiller rope at all because I never felt that I had good control of the rudder. I tried it set at different tensions without success. When I was motoring I sat with the tiller in the small of my back and steered by shifting along the seat.

That said, I saw Al Law standing up in his boat as it sailed along so he must have had both mainsheet and tiller rope locked off. I am looking at a wheel mounted on the port side to operate the tiller through a shorter rope and pulleys or Bowden cable. HTH
