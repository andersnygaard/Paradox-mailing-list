Subject: Re: Matt Layden In His Latest Design Currently Leading the UFC

Wizard is presently (10ish AM EST) only about 30 miles ahead of Whitecaps and Manitou Cruiser, and has just hit about 4 knots for the first time in a while. I think he needs a larger lead than that to stay ahead once they start upriver. Pelican looks like he has gone "outside" and is clocking almost 6 knots!! Big gamble but he is a long ways back. Crazy Russian got stranded when he landed to rest, and could not get back out on the water again for awhile due to the surf.

The next two, Running Mouth and SnoreBringsGator are quite a ways further back. Don't know if there are any others left now?

Will be interesting to see if Matt stays in the ditch or heads off-shore for the final leg north, before turning upriver.
