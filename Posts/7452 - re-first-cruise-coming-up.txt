As far as Yulohing goes, the best advice I ever had was from Al.
Keep the rudder up.
I made the mistake of putting it down on the first few attempts thinking I could steer.
Big mistake. I was totally out of control. You need to be able to swing the stern around, and that's just not possible when the rudder is down. It took me  while to learn (and a few bumps) but once it clicks it becomes second nature.

Don't underestimate this. This boat pulls a bigger crowd than Justin Beiber (whoever he is)
