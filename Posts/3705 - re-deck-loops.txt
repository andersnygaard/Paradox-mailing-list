Subject: Re: Deck Loops


Hi Steve,
My solution was to add some blocking under the deck and then bore a
9/16 inch hole and fill it with epoxy. Scuff up the pipe with 36 grit
paper and drill a couple of holes in the part that will be below deck
level. when you insert the pipe you will get a very good bond. I have
had no problem at all in five years.
