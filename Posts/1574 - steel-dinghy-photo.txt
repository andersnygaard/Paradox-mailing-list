Subject: Steel Dinghy Photo

Folks,

I've created a photo album (Longyard) and put a picture of a 9 foot steel dinghy in it. The boat is Dutch, and used as a tender for a motor barge. You see these little steel dinghies all over the Rhine and Danube on barges, and also all over Holland where steel small boatbuilding is common.
