Congrats on a successful adventure. Love to see more.

Your interior photo looks nice and dry, hopefully it was.

How much water do you think found its way in the various openings and around the hatch in those conditions?

Also, did you find the ventbox ventilation to be enough?

I've been told that my house needs to get finished before I resume work on my paradox so its bare hull sits on its trailer while I ponder drywall and tile. Your post has inspired me for the day.

Thankyou.
