Subject: Storing gas

I put a sketch of an idea I had for mounting an outboard motor on the side of the hull and also providing room for a plastic jerrycan of gas. It may also shield the motor somewhat from big swells too. Since I already have a motor mount built for this location I just stretched the idea a bit longer to hold the gascan too. This is only an abstract at the moment. I suppose all my anchors would need to shift to the opposite side!

cheers,
