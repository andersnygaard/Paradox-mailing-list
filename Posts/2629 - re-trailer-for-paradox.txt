I have seen Al's trailer up close and am hoping to get something suitable at less cost. I have a dinghy trailer available that has a large transverse leaf spring suspension, but I'm not sure that it is up to the weight of a laden Enuf. Also, the wheels aren't braked; is this necessary?

In the UK the limit for an unbraked trailer is 750kg gross trailer weight or half the towing vehicle's kerb weight - whichever is less.

So you may just be legal without brakes. In practice it would be very difficult for one person (or even 2) to manhandle my loaded trailer if it didn't have brakes.

If you can arrange things so that the wheels don't have to get wet it makes trailer brakes much less of a liability.

Hoping for calm nights
