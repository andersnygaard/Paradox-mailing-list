I have been wondering about something similar, leaving the tow ball 
on the car and dropping the back end onto the ground. As you say, 
though, the mechanism would have to be simple and inexpensive.

I recently saw a motorcycle trailer that by way of a tortional axle and winch would lower the bed flat onto the ground.  It could be done on a larger scale, might be a bit expensive for a one of a kind.
