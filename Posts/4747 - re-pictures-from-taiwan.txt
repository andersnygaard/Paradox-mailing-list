Hi Pete,

I am very happy that you like my pictures which be post on group. I didn't have any experience in boat building, but I really like the Paradox's design. I'll try my best to finish the whole works within these two months, and hope you can start to your building work soon.

Wish you have a wonderful New Year.

Jimmy
