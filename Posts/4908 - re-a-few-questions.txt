Ok thanks to all.
I'll check over all those pointers when I get a few spare seconds!

Thanks also for the paint advice. I've had a look on the web at the Bullseye 1-2-3. I notice a similar product by Dulux called Super Grip primer, which is supposed to stick to glass, ceramics etc. As B&amp;Q stock it, and my good lady wife works there and gets 20% discount, I'll probably buy a litre and see how it performs.

I had a look at the rubber mats in Maplin, na d yes there's more than enough there for a Paradox. I didn't buy a pack as I'm undecided yet what my needs are. I'm actually looking for some cheap camping mats to line the sides of the cabin with. I know they must be available somewhere beacause I have a couple of old damaged ones that i bought new, for about a pound each, a few years ago. All the ones nowadays seem to be around the =A310 mark (or more!).

I've added a few new photo's to my blog taken this afternoon.
