Subject: A question about build time vs the Enigma.
Date: Mon, 25 Jul 2011 15:28:43 -0000

I've been reading all I can about the Paradox build and it seems that it's taken most people around 18 to 24 months to complete working some nights and weekends.  I've also been looking at the Enigma 460 and people have completed boats in under half a year and many under a year. Are the construction methods vastly different for these two boats or is it just the lack of shelving and floor framing that makes the Enigma quicker to build.  I like both boats for different reasons but the Paradox is my favorite as it's more suited to cruising.
