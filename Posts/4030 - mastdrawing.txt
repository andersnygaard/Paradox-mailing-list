Hi,

I'm new to this group and I live in Utah, USA. I have received the plans to build the Paradox and have been able to interpret them all except for sheet #12 - the Mast detail/description. I am having trouble figuring out what it is trying to tell me. Could someone in this group please explain how to build it?

Is the mast asymmetrical? How do the dimensions work? I see a centerline and dimensions from that but have no idea how that applies to the material.

I would appreciate help with this.

Thanks,
Harry
