Subject: Re: Plywood Choices

The plans suggest Exterior ply, but I felt that the extra expense for marine ply was better than the extra maintenance down the line. All you need are a workbench and a couple of 4x4s on the ground. A flat bit of ground is useful for scarfing the side and bottom sheets. It's not a quick boat to build, but the construction process is organized so that it would be quite difficult to get it wrong.
