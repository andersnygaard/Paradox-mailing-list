Subject: Re: 2006 trips in Little Jim

I only ever intended to write about significant outings. Due to family commitments the only trips I have done since those were up and down the Solent, or around various estuaries. I would like to make a trip across to the Scillies next year which would warrant a write up.

What I really need is a secretary. I would be ok at dictating a trip report, but I find it very cumbersome having to type it.

Of course the real cure for the lack of adventurous Paradox reports from the UK is for some of the rest of you to finish your own boats.

Hoping for calm nights
