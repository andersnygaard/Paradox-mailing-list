Hi Stephen.

Sketchup might not be the best software for what you want to do. It's more of an architectural program. I use it a lot.
I take it that you want to draw out the components for your new project and then assemble it as a complete boat or similar.
A much better program for that is TrueSpace 7.5, a real 3D program.
I bought the 6.6 version about 3 years ago and it cost me about =A3240 from the States. 
The 7.5 version with all the updates, a far better program, is completely FREE !!!!!!!!!.
Grab it while you can from
http://www.caligari.com .
You can turn out photo realistic pictures and animations and lots of other stuff. There are also free downloadable manual, online video tutorials and free updates.
There is also an active forum.
All you need is to sign up with them to be able to download the program, which I had to do to do when I bought the 6.6 to get any updates.
One also had to pay for any video tutorial then.
