Making the frames from steel angle would give more room by making thinner vertical parts. The bulkhead at the rear of the sleeping area could be made without the plywood wall. So, by making more length to use out of the "as designed" principal dimensions you may be able to get what you want. I made a steel fram in my boat this way. Hence the name "Ironsides"
