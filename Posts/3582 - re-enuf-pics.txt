I wish this thread hadn't started.
I've just took a look at Enuf from both port and starboard sides and think that I may have put the pointy bit at the wrong end.
I'm too old to contemplate a move to Oz besides which my aunts, uncles and cousins who went there in the '60's have all gone native and would hardly be recognisable.
Much wringing of hands and woe is me-ing here :0)

Yeah, we have to build all our boats with the pointy-bit at the other end....

Didn't you know? The water goes round the other way in Oz.    :-O
