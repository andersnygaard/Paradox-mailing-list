Maybe this is now getting a bit ridiculous, but the question arises:
Why bother with the boat at all? I'm sure a sun-brolly from the same swimming-pool supplies emporium would do for a kite-sail and for auxiliary propulsion when the wind dies, you just kick your feet (flippers/fins might improve the overall efficacy!)
Think I might start a new Yahoo group to discuss the finer points....
