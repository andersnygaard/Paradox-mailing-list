I suppose marine plywood would be the very best thing to use, but I'll tell ya', I've built and repaired dozens and dozens (probably hundreds) of boats in my thirty-five years as a shipwright and I've never had a failure from AC ply due to the quality of wood or glue used in the manufacture of AC ply. There is an appearance factor that one would have to get by when using AC since one side has a rough face to it and there are more plies in marine plywood than AC.

Three eights is about the only AC plywood I'd not use because its only three plies thick and at 3/8" is a little weak for some of the jobs its called upon to do. A lot of plywood's strength comes not only from the quality of the wood and glue, but also from the number of plies in each sheet.

Have fun,

John

Thanks Al.
What kind of marine plywood did you use? How did it age?
Would you use the ACX grade from the home centers (in any part of the boat).
