Subject: Re: Swam thing photo

Thank you Dan for trying to send the photo. Luckily, another kind soul already emailed me with one so I'm all set. By the way, if you're interested in seeing a few pictures of the little boat at my house, then you can click on these links: http://www.microcruising.com/Graphics/swampthingarr.jpg and http://www.microcruising.com/Graphics/stg0002r2.jpg.
