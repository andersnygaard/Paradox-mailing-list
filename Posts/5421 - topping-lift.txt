Subject: Topping Lift

Hi Steve,

I think if you study the information in this file folder, the solution to the sail climbing the furling spool becomes obvious. Just raise the aft end of the boom up enough, using the topping lift, until it rolls evenly then mark the lift line at the ideal location.
