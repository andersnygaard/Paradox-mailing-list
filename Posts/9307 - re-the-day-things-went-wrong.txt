Compared to the injuries you've suffered Nick, my day was a walk in the park! One thing I didn't add to my story, was that I somehow got my foot under the chine when I was grounded on the sand bar, but no damage was done as the sand was soft and my foot just got pressed down, but I do remember Alastair warning us about the dangers of getting feet under the chines. Just something else to remember when using our unusual boats.
