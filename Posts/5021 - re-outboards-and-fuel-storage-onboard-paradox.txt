Subject: Re: Outboards and fuel storage onboard Paradox

So much depends on how one interprets the risks of having petrol on board a small vessel such as a Paradox.  I believe if all the precautions are taken it is perfectly safe.  I store mine in two five litre cans in the forepeak and I frequently examine them to ensure they are not leaking.  I never have the cooker on when handling petrol and always make sure the interior is petrol fume free.  I've used a similar regime on previous vessel and I'm content to continue.

Everyone must make their own choices and accept that they are responsible for them.

One thing is absolutely sure and that is that a petrol engine can be relied upon more so for travelling long distances than an electric engine.  I pondered the subject for a long time and made my choice which I believe was the right one.  There's no way I would be at Brighton without the engine.
