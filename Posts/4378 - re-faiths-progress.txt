Hi Bill,

Looks like you will be afloat long before me. 

Have you and Al set a date for the Falmouth cruise yet? 

Using PeelPly has resulted in quite a smooth rounded edge finish as can be seen in the photo's. Its well worth the extra effort.

I would like to think we can all meet up later on in the season and sail in company, say Poole Harbour or the Solent. We will see.

You never know. The unexpected can happen. There's still a good deal of work yet to do and I need fine, dry, warm weather to do it. 

Ideally, I would like a combi. I had a quote which worked out at =A31800.00 and I thought I would try to get by on something cheaper; hence I bought the trailer used by Derek Clark for his Paradox 'Enuf'. 

If all works out as proposed, Al and I should be finishing our West Country cruise in the Falmouth area which may extend to the Scilly Isles. Maybe you'll be around too?

Hope all goes well for you.

Cheers,
Bill.
