Subject: Lower Gudgeon and Flaring Pipe
Date: 20 Feb 2016 20:21:50 -0800


I'm wondering about two things:

1. Should I insert a short piece of flared pipe into the LOWER gudgeon for the rudder cheek pintle to rotate inside? I'm concerned that the pintle will chew into the epoxy if it isn't sleeved.

2. Wherever the plans call for brass sleeving through the hull eg. the halyard and tack lines, did you just flare the top side of the pipe? I'm assuming that you can't flare both ends because you would have to do that in situ and I can't see how that would be possible.

Cheers,

Rob.

PS: Waterproofing water ballast tanks and fitting rudder assembly at the moment.
