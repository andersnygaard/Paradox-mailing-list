Subject: please help!!!

Hello again everyone.

I'm getting very desperate. I'm not having any luck what so ever trying to get ahold of plans, book, etc. I'm really getting worried that I may never be able to build the Paradox at all because of this.

I don't know what e-mail address to use, after trying out 2 of them, and both coming back to me saying some kind of problem with the addy. Should I just give up on this and move on to another boat? Perhaps the plans are no longer around? Or maybe Matt is sailing off somewhere in the wild blue.

Did you ever have the feeling of wanting something so bad, that it creates a whole new type of emotion that is hard to explain? Anybody relate?

Well thanks all. I'm hoping somebody can help out.

Jeff
