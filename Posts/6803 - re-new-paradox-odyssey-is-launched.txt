Subject: Re: New Paradox Odyssey is launched

Very nice, and very pretty.

Aleksander must be a lot heavier than me (though I find that hard to believe) or else he needs more ballast as I can't get my Paradox to come near to going over by hanging out on the mast.

Hello folks. This is CrazyRussian from Watertribe.
Friend of mine, Aleksander Fadeev, member of this group, has launched his beautiful boat last week. He is exploring New York Long Island coast right now, after sailing the boat from Barnegat Bay, NJ, his home base.

Last week he stopped by my mooring field on Staten Island, NY, were we spent all weekend fixing and trying to break and generally shake up the boat as much as we can, while learning her. I shoot a few videos which you may find interesting.

Isn't she beautiful?  Have you seen the Paradox with teak deck yet? :)

I hope Alexander will let you know his feelings and observation at the end of his trip, he is overwhelmed with the new experience. Wish him Fair winds

All videos are here
