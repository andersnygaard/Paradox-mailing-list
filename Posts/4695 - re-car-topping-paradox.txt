Hi James.

As Matts ENEIGMA has proved to be car toppable and although plans for her seem no nearer, Matts a busy guy, I have already given a bit of thought on the matter of a removable hardtop while looking at her design.

If the hardtop was designed to the same shape as the original folding soft top and made out of 1.5mm ply. Just bend the ply to shape and s&amp;g the front windscreen. Given a later of glass cloth both inside and out, the window apertures cut out and fitted with 1.5 - 2mm clear acrylic. The weight should not be far off the soft top's with the internal tubing.

This would be doable and work well, even to leaving it fixed to the boat while on the roof rack.
