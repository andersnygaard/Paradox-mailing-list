Subject: Vane gear

For those interested I have posted some pictures of Zo=EB's wind vane steering unit (still untested) in the files section in " Zo=EB's Vane Gear" folder. Please keep in mind that this is a prototype so some more work may still be required. The Oar blade still needs fiberglassing and the up haul and down haul lines installed. I hope to get out this week to give it a try and make a quick time movie of it in action. If all goes well I'll draw up some plans and post them. It might be noted that the vane assembly itself could be used to drive any type output device like a trim tab or servo pendulum oar, the mount is all that would require developing.
