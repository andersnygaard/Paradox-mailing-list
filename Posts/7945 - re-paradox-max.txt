Subject: Meeting Follow-Up

Hi John,

I just wanted to follow up on our meeting last week regarding the new project. As discussed, I have started working on the report and should have a draft ready for you to review by the end of the week.

Also, I wanted to remind you that the deadline for the project is fast approaching, so please let me know if you need any additional support from me.

Best regards,
Jane
