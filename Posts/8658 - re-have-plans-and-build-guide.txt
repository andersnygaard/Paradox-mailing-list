Dear Mr. Erik,

There is no comparison between a jig saw, however good it is, to a good table saw. In this project you have to get long straight lines that are impossible to make with a jig saw. You should look for a sturdy table saw which will enable you to cut out of whole sheets of plywood. Reserve the jig saw for small inlets and sharply curved parts.
