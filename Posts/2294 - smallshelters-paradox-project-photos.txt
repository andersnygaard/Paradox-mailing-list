Greetings Matt,

I plan on Maybe strip planking the Bottoim and not the Sides. I think two layers of 3/8" on the Bottom plus the Glass and Glass over the 3/8" sides {Wih No Strip Planking} might work just fine.
I don't know that I will be able to do it in "Epoxy" though. I was using Epoxy on an Ultralight Airplane I was building a couple of years ago and I got very sick, My Face puffed up and I broke out in a bad rash, took about two weeks to get over that. "West Sytems" or "System Three" may have some "non =3D-alergenic" Epoxy?? Either that or I could find someone else to do that part of the Project for me. I would much rather use Epoxy.

Thank You,
Dave Blow
