Nels,

Airplane fuselages most definitely were made out of steel during the dates I
cited.  Welded steel construction because popularized by the Fokker series
of fighters in WWI and continued into the 1930s as noted.  Only after that
did aluminum monocoque construction become the standard.  Many homebuilt
aircraft, including ones I have worked on, have been made with steel
fuselages (chrome/moly 4130).  Many others have been made from wood and it
is a long standing duel between the two materials as to which is best.  In
professional aircraft construction  steel won out over wood immediately
after WWI.

Yours,
Bill Longyard
