Hi Rod,

My first thought was that, given the right conditions, the boat would have no problems with that trip, it is the skipper that is the weak link.

The fact that you are asking the question suggests that you are not ready to go.

Build the boat, make a few short cruises, make a few longer cruises and soon you will know the answer for yourself.

Also, try reading a few books by people who have made long ocean crossings in small boats. Most of them seem to have had a miserable time of it.

Hoping for calm nights
