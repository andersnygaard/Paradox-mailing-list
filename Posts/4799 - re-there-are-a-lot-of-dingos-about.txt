Hi Al,

Whether it stalls is surely a function of the foil section, the angle of attack and how fast you wiggle it. I would assume all the designers of slalom sculls take those into account.

In Little Jim I vary the angle of the shaft over the stern depending on what I am doing. To accelerate hard, or travel fast for a few moments the shaft is steeper than when cruising, in shallow water it is more horizontal. Perhaps you should make your fence adjustable. Maybe a pendulum system could keep it horizontal at all times :-)

A fence on the end of the blade would be useful when using it as a quant, to stop the end sinking into the mud.

The slalom blade does have the advantage, over the falling leaf blade, that it can be used as a rudder when 'freewheeling', and it does allow quicker turns to be made. It will be interesting to compare them.

Hoping for calm nights,

Jeff
