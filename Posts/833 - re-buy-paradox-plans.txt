Well thanks.

It is really very simple, just take it one step at a time. The steaming is done to bend strips of wood which are then laminated and glued to the bulkheads. If you used thinner strips (but more of them) then they would bend without steaming. I think someone here is laminating up strips of ply which also don't need steaming.

The motor would be hung on the transom. You only need 2hp. I am going to try the first season without a motor and see how I get on. It is supposed to be very easy to drive with the yuloh.

The sides and bottom go on very easily, though with the bottom you have to be quite quick as a lot of glue has to go on first, then just start nailing from the bows. 

You're right about the pictures of the bottom. I am using a borrowed digital camera and that bit of the assembly was over before I could borrow it again. 

The plans come from Dave Bolduc (mbolduc@triad.rr.com). look at his web site for more information (home.triad.rr.com/lcruise/paradox1.htm). Don wrote a series of articles on building a Paradox which lay down step by step instructions. Without these I wouldn't have stood a chance, with them it was easy. Not quick, mind you, I started cutting wood in August 2001, I am aiming to launch at easter or before.
