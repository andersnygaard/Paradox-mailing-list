Subject: Re: Ballast access

I drilled and tapped into the top of my lead bricks and screwed in a plate with the other end bolted into the top of the chine log. It doesn't hold it particularly firmly, but they show no sign of moving and I think they would hold if the boat was inverted. 

To start off with I wouldn't fasten them in. Both I and Derek moved them around a bit on the early sails to get it all balanced right.

Hoping for calm nights
