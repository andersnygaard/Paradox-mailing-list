Tropicstar is a power sharpie that my friend Steve made from an old Star class sailboat. He cut most of the keel off, leaving only about a foot for directional stability. Then a cabin was added along with a four stroke 8 hp Honda outboard. Steve had planned to go to the Bahamas with it but I don't think he was up to the trip. I'm sure the boat could have made it, but he decided that it needed more testing than a few days in the Keys with us. In all honesty, the boat was a bit top heavy since the cabin was made from 3/4" plywood and had tempered glass windows. In the end he spent six weeks in the Florida Keys with her, and she worked very well with her 1' draft. To make her more seaworthy Steve has been talking about cutting the cabin off, and making a lighter and longer one. As is the boat would make a great river or canal boat. With the above mentioned modifications it would be quite nice for the Bahamas just as long as you brought along a 2 hp kicker.
