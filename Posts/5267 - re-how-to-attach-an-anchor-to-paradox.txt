I too have been going thru the same questions on my own boat. There is a sea story I read once about a couple off the coast of Madagascar, Their 35 or 40 foot sailboat was in a very great storm. They were streaming sea anchors and other impediments off of the two stearn cleats. Both cleats were very very well anchored into the hull structure. The deck area aroud the cleats ripped off and they lost big sections of their afterdeck and their sea anchors. They almost sank. but pulled tru OK. So therefor if you consider how well to bolt into the hull you might ask youself which would I rather have a ripped off fitting or a ripped off bow? There is a balance to the design. Like Goldilocks. Not too much and not too little, but just right. I have elected to use broad washers under my cleat bolts. My stainless steel U-bolt thru the stem is also backed up with broad washers. I intend to use the U-bolt for trailer duty and the cleats for anchor duty. I built the bow area just as shown on the drawings. I expect the weight of the whole loaded boat coud be picked up by just one cleat and not break. I am just judging by eye here. I used two 3/8ths carriage bolts thru 8 inch oaken, homemade cleats. I drilled a hole thru the cleats between the bolts to run a line tru just as Al mentions. It's nice to have more choices.
