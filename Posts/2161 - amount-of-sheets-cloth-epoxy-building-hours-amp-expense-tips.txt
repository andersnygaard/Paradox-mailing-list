Subject: Amount of sheets, cloth, epoxy? Building Hours & expense tips
Date: Wed, 21 Jul 2004 09:13:21 -0000

Can anybody here give me the scoop on how many plywood sheets, yardage of fiberglass cloth, and gallons of epoxy are needed to build a Paradox?

I'm sure it says it in the plans... but I don't have a set yet. 

Also, anyone care to share approximately how many hours they spent building their Paradox? Got any tips for reducing expenses?

Thanks,
Matt Wagner

PS. I might be selling a set of Bolger Long Micro plans if I decide to start on a Paradox. Send me an email if you are interested.
