My wife has always been pretty comfortable just sitting atwhartships on the forward berth cushions with her back to the windward side when she has been along. I thought that it would be kind of stuffy but she reports quite a lot of air comes through the vent box and she has never felt closetaphobic.

  Thanks for the replies...
  Another thought, from one who has the plans but never seen a Paradox in the flesh(ply?), would a second seat mounted below the forwd end of the hatch be an option for a second person? or would there be no knee-room for the one at the 'normal' seat?
