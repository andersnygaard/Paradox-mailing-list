Hi,

I eventually got it to work, and it was just finger trouble. I am not so good at computers. And another nice guy posted it in full on a personal email to me.

Good read! Getting impatient has its consequences, I suppose? I can kill time on my Paradox easily. I’m a good sleeper and love a nap and carry fishing gear with me as well as books. There’s lots of room for all my distractions. I’ve drifted asleep a fair bit on calmer days and often have a nap on day sails. Staying in port is something I have to keep reminding myself is part of sailing.

Hope someone is out sailing somewhere right now.

Nick
