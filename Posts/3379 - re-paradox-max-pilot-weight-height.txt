Not exactly sure how that was decided. Perhaps our fearless moderator may clarify, as he sailed on HM. Both it and Jubilee also have a centerboard and from what I recall between the combination is really effective. The narrow wing runners as they are called, are more effective than they estimated them to be and yet don't create excessive turbulence as larger ones might. For example when sailing downwind with the board completely raised.

Seems to me that at about a 25 foot waterline is where Matt might consider having a centerboard in addition to chine runners. Also dpending on how much off-shore sailing one plans to undertake.

Of course the centerboard may be useful if lightly loaded as well. Lots of versatility. Interesting design:
