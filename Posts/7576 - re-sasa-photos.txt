I, too, worry about the water ballast.
I understand that the water ballast is drinking water; so, as you cruise and consume water, you reduce your ballast. It will start to slosh (or sploosh) and your boat will suffer from free surface effect. Potable water tanks are risky: one small contamination and your whole supply is contaminated; and those tanks will not be easy to clean.
I'd prefer a little more lead ballast, and to keep my drinking water in 2 pint milk bottles (jugs). These will be easy to re-distribute.

Although nobody seems to have reported any of these problems: am I missing something?
Perhaps these things were explained in previous messages?

Yes, a double tillered Paradox.
I don't think that has been suggested in my reading of earlier posts.
The above deck tiller should allow the bungy cord or surgical rubber to tiller/sheet to boom self steering system (Captain Voss raw chic).
I will upload some photos showing how I tortured my beloved SaSa's behind into shape.
While I'm rabbiting on I want to suggest to the Paradox builder/owners how about water bladders in the water holds. The holds don't have baffles, 70lbs of water/ballast lolling back and forward, this way and that and making splooshing sounds when you're trying to get to sleep? The water might be better contained in a number of bladders (include their own taps) down there in the holds..

Re-reading your message gave me the answer: you'll have two tillers.

I'm looking at your build (and others) before deciding whether to build a Paradox myself.

You're putting the tiller above the after deck instead of through the transom. So you won't need the hole in the transom. I see your transom has no holes, neither for the tiller nor for the spars.
So why have you installed the bendy-scoopy-water-drainy thing inside the transom?

I'm impressed that you have built a curved transom: could you give us more details on how you did that?

Oops, problem uploading pics, going to Johanna file. Sorry about that.
There is a photo of the 'upper tiller', above deck to enable selfsteering. There will also the beneath deck tiller as well for interior steering.
