A picture of Little Cruiser's sail plan has been uploaded into the file area under "David's Pictures." However, I did notice that the measurements are a little hard to read. Therefore I have listed them below. 

All measurements in mm. 
Luff=1900; 
Yard/Head=2870; 
Segmented Leech (top to bottom)=1590,1615,1620; 
Foot=3560; 
Overall height=3560+130=3690 and 
Diagonals=4335,3920,3820.
