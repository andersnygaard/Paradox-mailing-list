Subject: Mock up of Hatch

I've opened a new album in photos named MoreEnuf and put in a picture of a cardboard mock up hatch.

http://ph.groups.yahoo.com/group/paradoxbuilders/photos/view/1184?b=3D1

I'd like to be able to use the seat even with the hatch closed (stiff knees) and also use the outboard with the hatch closed but the rear window open. The forward sloping face will be Lexan and there will be windows in each side. I've decided on sliding (although there is still time to change my mind yet again) and the slider fittings will be inside the hatch.

I'd appreciate any comments before I commit myself to cutting ply tomorrow morning.

Thanks  ...  Derek
