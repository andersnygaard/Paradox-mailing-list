I have thought of making oars and rowlocks too. I was using the type called north woods type. There is a pin thru the oarlock and oar so that there is no feathering. Then I could make the oar curved down to the water and make interferance with the cabintop go away. The curved oars would lay nicely on the deck where the yuloh was too. I'm not sure I will do this. Just a thought. If one did put in special high setting oarlocks they would eliminate the need for those two deck loops of copper shown it the plans. For storing the sailrig and yuloh. Cheers, Steve
