Hi Karl,

Just curious - was that when Sven lived in Lyeskil? The reason I ask is
I have a cousin living there who knew him then. Also have two friends
near Goteborg, one an avid small boat sailor.

Nice sailing area north from Lyeskil towards  Oslofyorden  especially if
you enjoy rocky terrain:-) I have only driven that way though.
