Unfortunately Don, while having much to offer is so full of himself that he was constantly a arguing with group members and flaming them for not taking his God like advice on every thing. It got to the point I had to ban him from the group. 

I've never felt very happy with the decision to ban Don; it jars a bitwith the idea of the US being the home of free speech. Could it not be time to bury the hatchet and invite him back? if you explain why you want to try a particular idea I've found him very helpful.

Personally, I find Nutty Boats hard to stomach so I don't read his posts but I have found that one or two that reply to him are worth reading for their neat turn of phrase.

Even though I'm not a big fan of banning people, in this case there is little effect on Don's ability to vice is opinion. He has paradoxboatbuilders.
