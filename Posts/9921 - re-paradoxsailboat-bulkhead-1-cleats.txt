Peter thanks!

Any opinions of possible suggestions I’ve seen for 1 x 12mm or 2 x 9mm instead of 18mm for bottom? I’ve heard it is very difficult to bend into shape?

I didn't have a table saw, in fact it's unnecessary, although it would speed things up. You can cut bulkheads by hand, or with a circular saw, or combination of both. You can put a rough bevel on the cleats, lifted from the plan, but as they're rolling, you'll need to finish them with a hand plane anyway during dry assembly.

Ben, I have watched your build videos on YT in Elliotts book he says a table saw is a necessity but it looks like you cut bulkheads and sides with a circular saw is that correct?
Do I need a table saw?

You also say you might not have used 18mm for the bottom. What would you have done different?
Any additional tips are welcome.

Thanks!

This is just a sanity check.

On the after face of Bulkhead #1, it appears there should be cleats for the P&Stbd Lockers. However these aren't shown on DWG #7. I see them on DWG #3 and 4. 
Am I missing any measured layout for these cleats in the plans?

I just wanted to get a double check. Worst case I can estimate based on DWG #4 (and these don't likely have to be exact.)
