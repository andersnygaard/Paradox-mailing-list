Subject: Re: Transom

I don't remember where it says to do it, but my transom is curved (just checked it). It is certainly not enough to give any trouble during assembly. I probably just guessed the amount after seeing that it is shown curved on sheet 8. I say this as, when I checked just now with a straight edge I found that the 2 sides are not exactly the same.

On a similar point, if I were building again I wouldn't bother trying to shape the bevels until I came to the trial assembly, then take them off freehand with an angle grinder (with sanding disc). Any errors just mean a bit more epoxy.

It's too much fun to sail to spend forever building it.
