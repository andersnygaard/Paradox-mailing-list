That's pretty much it David, there is a product called Gitrot, which is basically a very thin epoxy, that you can inject into the rot and it hardens the soft wood, this is fine if it is a small area. On large areas do as you did and dig it out and fill with epoxy and cabasil.

Before coating anything with epoxy you might want to treat everything with a Borate solution for longevity as per Carnel. I bought a pound of 100% Boric Acid (Roach Killer) at Food Lyon the other day for a dollar, enough to treat a ship.
