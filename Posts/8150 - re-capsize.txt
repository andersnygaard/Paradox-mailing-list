While we're on the subject of the mast, I've not noticed anywhere on
the plans a method for keeping the mast inside the boat in the event
of a capsize.  I guess the halyard would half work (although that is a
very long distance to maintain adequate downward tension), providing
you had the rig raised, but if you had completely lowered the sail,
then I can't see what would stop the mast falling out.

You are quite correct, though as long as the halyard is cleated off 
inside it would not be possible to lose it completely.

However, the likelihood of the as-designed mast coming out are low. I 
have never had any suggestion that it was even thinking of doing so. 
In a more-than-90-degree knock-down the buoyancy of the mast would 
hold it in. Less-than90-degree and gravity is your friend.

For the belt, braces and piece of string brigade your tiedown idea 
would do no harm.
