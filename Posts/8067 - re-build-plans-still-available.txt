Hi Sean,

I was able to obtain the Plans and the building manual from the sources below - in both cases email was responded to quickly and payment was made by Paypal - both doc sets arrived by email very shortly later - a great service all round.

Paradox plans: Dave Bolduc sells and distributes the Paradox Plans. He can be contacted by email at: mbolduc@triad.rr.com or by "snail mail" at: David Bolduc, 1736 Phillips Avenue, Greensboro, NC 27405, U.S.A. I believe the plans are still the bargain price of $40 (US). Study Plans are available to peruse here - http://www.microcruising.com/plans1.htm.

Builders Manual: The late Don Elliot also produced an excellent "Building Paradox" manual. Don's widow, Wanda, is selling his Paradox Boat Building Manual. She will answer all replies as soon as possible and can send all the info you will need to order the Paradox manual either by PDF or as a CD. Her email address is: rite2wanda@yahoo.com. A sample of the sketches in his manual can be found here - http://www.microcruising.com/Sketch1.htm.

As noted above - I contacted both David and Wanda earlier this year - they both responded very quickly. Payment was made by Paypal and the docs were emailed shortly after - both sets of documents are very much value for money.

Cheers,
Gary Mac
