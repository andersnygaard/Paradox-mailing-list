The rails that are epoxied in can also be removed by heating with a torch until the epoxy is soft and pulling them out. This is also how you remove fasteners that were hardware bonded in place.

The strongest way to install the yuloh stowage rail is the way Glen described it. However, if you do not want to make it "permanent" then you could make the rails a little different and just bolt them on. This is how they were done on Little Cruiser. I've had the rails off for years, but now I am replacing them because we will be carring our yuloh on our next trip year. You can see this arrangement on the attached photo.
