It's funny that this comes up now. I got married July 30th, and we went to Hawaii for our honeymoon. Had a wonderful time there... but on the way back, the pilot nearly botched the landing... we were all very close to being runway pizza. Last second he pulled it together though, and the worst that actually happened was they shut down the airport for a while as they were trying to figure out what had gone wrong. *heh*

Anyhow. I vowed "never again". I mean that. I'd *much* rather sail a Paradox to Hawaii than ever fly again.

I will never fly commercial again... I will drive or take a boat. :)

After years of flying around the Canadian Arctic - where a 50 year old DC3 was considered "state of the art"I have pushed my luck more than a few times and vowed never again. The stories I could tell.

But if my choice was going to Hawaii in a Paradox or a commercial jet- or driving on an LA freeway during rush hour?

Well - I might have to reconsider:-) 

Besides where is that sense of adventure you mention?

Flying is fine - its the landings that might get you.
