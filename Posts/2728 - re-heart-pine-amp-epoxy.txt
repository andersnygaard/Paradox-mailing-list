David,

The stuff is probably fine. In fact, if it's old growth, it's close grain and relative lack of knots probably makes it stronger than what you can get now. The only issue I see is that if the wood came out of an attic, it hasn't suffered from heat damage or overdrying. That will sometimes make a species check and split more easily, making the use of fasteners without predilling nearly impossible. I have particularly found that to be true with Doug Fir. Try working with a piece-- if it works OK, it's fine. 

Use with epoxy should not be an issue.
