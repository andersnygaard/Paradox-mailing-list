Subject: Re: Steel?

I agree David. They sure take their sandblasting and welding seriously don't they? They basically say that your average welder doesn't have the necessary expertise. Of course they are probably dealing with warranty and liability concerns, which the DIY person wouldn't have to be too concerned about (maybe?).

I notice that the smallest design they sell plans for in steel is 25 feet with over 5 tons displacement. (Smallest plywood plans is for a 10 footer.) This is in keeping with the research done by Phil Bolger who feels 25 feet is the smallest for a serious off-shore steel design. I think that is because in smaller sizes the scantlings have to be lighter and the risk of welding distortion and unfair shapes becomes very high unless expensive jigs and welding machines are used. 

Also, the amount of floatation required takes up too much storage space in a small steel sailboat, especially if you want enough ballast and flotation for it to sail with any kind of performance, and be self-righting, and self-rescuing.

So it would seem that although a steel sailboat may be stronger than a plywood one, it makes a lot more practical sense in boats that are much larger than Paradox. Unless of course you are interested in a basically floating buoy - which some of the tiny steel sailboats resemble:-)
