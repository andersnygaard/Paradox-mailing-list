Subject: Re: replacing wood spars for aluminum

I enjoyed looking at your excellent work in the photos you posted. I see one detail I would change, maybe. The spool area that for the reefing line has a very small diameter. This means a very very hard pull on the line. If you were to pack something on here to increas the diameter you might have a more pleasant action from it. Mine is made to plans sizes and I need to wear gloves to operate it. If I were to make another one I would make the spool area a bigger diameter on the outside dia. of the rims and the core of the boom area also. To give a good action with less force on my hands. Less tension.
