Subject: Re: Luxurious microcruising

Mindy and I started cruising together aboard my open 13 footer, Wet Feet, back in the early 1980's. She was very appropriately named, leaked continuously, and we generally always were wet and a little miserable, especially when it rained. Later on we acquired Little Cruiser, and we've been cruising in LUXURY ever since.  No more sleeping under a soggy boom tent with your gear floating around in the bilges. Now we have a dry place to sleep, bottles of wine in the bidge to make toasts, and good books to read on the shelves.  If we want to watch a movie, make a phone call or browse the internet, we have our Iphone to keep contact with the outside world. In fact, cruising in little boats has never been more luxurious, and there are no more excuses left not to leave home for a trip on the water.
