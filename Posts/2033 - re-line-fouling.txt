Your solution sounds like it should work. Incidentally, I have the same problem on Little Cruiser, and I have to be careful not to catch the engine or the sculling bracket with the sheet when we tack and jibe.

Hi All, After doing all the Mod,s Matt recomended plus some, I spent 
a week doing sea trials down in Pirates Cove Ala. I am pleased with 
everything except one. The main sheet fouling problem, with my 
outboard the problem is compounded. The only solution I have come up 
with is to mount a sch 40 brass rod from port to starboard across the 
transom, a couple of inches off the deck, run the sheet out the 
transom as in the plans straight up thru a fairlead on the bar and 
tie the end to the bar above where its normaly tied. I believe this 
will keep the sheet out from the motor and the rudder. Any thoughts ? 
Will this effect the sailing in any way ? might could build a place 
on the bar for the Yuloh and would make a great hand hold.

Thanks
