Jim, if you are going along that line, you could use sheet lead with epoxy and sand to keep it put. Make sure the sand is hot dried, then allowed to cool, before mixing in the epoxy. Hot drying the sand removes any moisture.

I'm still considering using the tanks for their original design purpose, that's for a fresh water supply.

No final decision yet made.

Bill.
