From the state of the water I would guess there was a wind of between Force 2 and 3 Beaufort scale.

Paradox is an easily driven vessel and because she's heavy displacement she carries her way.  She has very little wetted area and hence low drag and her narrow beam reduces resistence to forward motion.  Matt knew what he was doing when he designed her.  Incidentally, when the sail is balanced with the rudder, the latter is almost neutral, being very slightly off centre with minimal weather helm and drag.  She also tracks exceptionally well.
