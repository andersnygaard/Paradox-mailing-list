The slipways I use are frequently busy. With some of them you are expected to pay to use them and many times there are power boaters that use them too. I can imagine lots of angry people if I had my Paradox clogging the slipway waiting for the tide to rise and it wouldn't be long before somebody showed up to issue me with a fine.
