Subject: Re: Vane Gear was: Main sheet

Just to add my 2 pence to the discussion.

As the Paradox tracks so well I would be tempted to build a system with a small separate rudder, not connected to the boat's main rudder. Then the course would be set using the main rudder, which would be locked off, and the vane rudder would apply small corrections to keep the course true. This would mean that the vane system would not need to be nearly as powerful as one which could control the main rudder.

I would then investigate mounting the whole assembly on the fore deck where there is no problem of fouling the rig. Is there any reason why a rudder over the bow wouldn't work?

Having said that, I see no need for a Paradox self steering system unless you want to sleep while sailing.
