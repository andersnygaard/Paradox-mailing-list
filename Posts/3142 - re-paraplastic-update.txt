Thanks for asking, Paul.

I've been away, on the Acores two weeks (gin&amp;tonic at Peter's Bar,
asking about properties for me and also Sven, no big deal) and then
I've been mourning in a boat builder's depression. So now I'm
beginning to catch up with the postings here, and in the microcruising
group. You guys do have fast typing fingers.

My proud ship has been launched twice, but not sailed. The first time
I didn't have access to the trailer ramp longer than for it to be wet.
The second time I found out that my rudder was floating like a cork.
Repression of thought is normally a wonderful thing. When I made the
rudder, a very long time ago, I surely didn't think it would sink by
itself (but then again perhaps...). Somehow I thought that it would be
fairly easy to arrange a line or bungee chord or something to pull it
down. When experiencing the whole thing in reality I knew that it
wasn't so. Back to the lab, making diffferent tests to see if lead
could be melted into the divinycell. It cannot. But finally I found ot
that it was possible to isolate the d. with some epoxy. So, digging
out divinycell with a special drill might do it. No. I could just get
some 100ml out, which is less than 1/3 of what's needed (I reckon).
So, now I've started to cover the lower parts of the rudder with
what's left of the bronze sheet I just on the bottom.

All for now.
I'll return about the rig.
