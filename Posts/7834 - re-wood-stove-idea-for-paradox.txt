Subject: Re: Wood Stove Idea for Paradox

Is this Dylan Winter?

He has the extraordinary idea that if you put a candle under a flowerpot it increases the heat output!
There was a long thread about it on the Wooden Boat Forum,  and another on (I think) YBW.   Lots of speculation but no experiments or measurements.

I find the proposal for a woodstove quite frightening.
