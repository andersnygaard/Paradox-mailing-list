If I remember correctly the original Paradox has a single part sheet. 
When Matt drew up the plans he changed it to a 2 part (good thing too, I wouldn't like to have to haul it in without that mechanical 
advantage).

The view in sheet 1 shows the end of the sheet attached to an eye 
at the port side of the transom, with the other end going through a 
hole. The sheet is off centre because the mast is off centre.

It works for me.

a couple of months ago there was a short discussion on how Matt
changed the sheet's entry through a new hole the transom
before I make any holes, does anyone know?
from the picture in the files, you cannot tell where the sheet
originates or is it so that the eye-bolt is moved towards the center,
and you cannot see the entry, which might be the old one? OR, is it so
that there is no block on the boom anymore, just a single rope through
that, presumed, new hole? i.e., you wouldn't need the gear?
