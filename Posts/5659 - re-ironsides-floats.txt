Steve,

I know what you mean about collecting materials. That's what I have been trying to do. Collecting the lead has been tuff. I only have about 50 lbs now. The tire stores are going to steel weights for environmental reasons and won't give up on what they have. What lead is available is selling for around $1 per pound or more. Far from what an old retired boat builder guy can afford. I might have to pour some cement/scrap steel blocks for ballast like Buehler recommends in his Backyard Boat building book. The last tire store I visited had a few weights laying around the parking lot which I quickly collected and put in my pocket.
