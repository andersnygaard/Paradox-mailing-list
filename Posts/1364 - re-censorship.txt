Well put Nels, I did consider the option of asking him to change his ways but in the end decided it would only be putting off the inevitable and prolong the abuse.

I would just like to add my thoughts on the above subject as I believe that the right of free speech is one of our basic human rights and I am certain that Glen would share this view.

However I also believe that there should be zero tolerance given to abusive behavior, which includes physical, mental and verbal abuse.

Verbal abuse can be as damaging as the other two kinds and therefor I believe a moderator has a right and duty to restict membership to those who seem to use it as a weapon for forcing their views or philosophies on others.

At the same time I feel it only fair that a person be forewarned before being banned - so that they are given an opportunity to either apologize or at least get a fair hearing.

I was unceremoniously banned from one group for being off-topic when I inadvertantly posted a message that was meant for a different group.

I was uncerimoniously banned from Don's group even though I had never posted to it. He wrote me an offline message regarding a post I made to microcruising and when I responded in a way not to his likeing he banned me from his group!

Also I think that we should understand that members in some countries have to pay for every email they get so one a or two word posting costs them as mouch as a whole page. Therefor I suggest keeping the posts newsworthy and relevant as much as possible.

And perhaps above all try to see the others points of view before getting to reactive:-)

Cheers, Nels
