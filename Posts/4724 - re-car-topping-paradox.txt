Hi those were some great sailing film on your site. 
Gave me a great boost on this grey wintry day. 
Interesting that matt went for bigger enigma, but why did he not 
make it 4ft beam at chine would it not sail faster when lightly 
laden? Also plane on occasions? 
Interested to see that he is opting for higher aspect chine wings, 
and that the spray dodger works well. 

Bill when are you sailing next or is it all over for this year. 
Tell us when when you are sailing in poole harbour and I will join 
you, not yet in a paradox but i could get my summer breeze out. 
How about a sail in the humber, or the lakes, pub to pub! 

Yours James
