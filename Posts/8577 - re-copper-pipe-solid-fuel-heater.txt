I'm not as tough as you are Alastair, which is why I need heating.
My little boat is fully insulated by the junk all around the inside. You can barely see the sides from inside.

 As designed the Paradox
 has 2 inches of foam lining the sides and 
 deck. This provides floatation (in case of a
 swamping), soundproofing 
 (all those
 slapping halyards) and insulation. 
 
 I believe Bill never fitted this on Faith,
 which may explain why Jim 
 felt the need to
 fit his heater.
 
 I have the
 insulation and have never felt the need for a heater, even
 
 when it snowed or when I woke with 1 inch
 of frost on the deck (first 
 night
 afloat!).
 
 Mostly my body
 heat keeps everything comfortable but, occasionally, 
 it is cold when I come back on board in the
 evening. In these 
 circumstances I make a
 coffee before going to bed and this heats 
 everything up nicely.
 
 Perhaps foam may be simpler, less dangerous,
 less messy and less 
 trouble (though perhaps
 not as much fun) as a heater.

 Thanks for the added description of your
 heater Jim. I was wondering
 what that
 "blanket" was hanging on the cabin side in your
 pictures on
 your blog.
 
 I only had a short
 time today to play with this heater but I did find
 a round aluminum cake pan to put under the
 heater and a smaller pan
 that I thought
 I might use as the "foot" of the stove to hold it
 off
 the floor. The thick plywood base
 sounds like an easier stored way to
 protect the floor so I will probably use that instead of the
 pan but
 will use the round pan unless I
 find something better like a shallow
 rectangular one.
 
 The tip about the charcoal being a longer lasting, more
 gentile heat
 is especially helpful. I
 think it will depend on the weather which
 one is wanted. I'll probably use
 more wood scraps (or found little
 sticks along the way) than charcoal. I'm hoping my
 tiny cabin space
 is almost heated from
 body heat alone and the heater is only needed
 for a quick burst of heat. I won't
 know until I get to try it but I
 once
 used a thin sheet metal Army tent heater that would throw a
 lot
 of heat just from burning junk mail
 and other crumpled up pieces of
 paper. The heat from the flames very quickly heated the
 thin metal
 and would be throwing a good
 amount of heat within minutes of lighting
 it. From my couple quick tests of this
 miniature wood burner, it
 looks like
 this one will work the same. No fire brick or other
 shielding to prevent the heat from getting
 out of the burner so it
 should be great
 for quickly warming up and/or drying out after a day
 of boating.
 
 I still need to find a flue pipe for this
 thing. I might go with
 copper pipe
 and whatever fittings it takes to get it out of the cabin
 and forget about the flexible pipe that I
 haven't found yet. It will
 still
 be removable for storing, cleaning, or maybe even beach
 use.
 
 I also might
 get rid of the bent-pipe I already fastened to my boat as
 a possible outer pipe for the chimney. I
 think a simple metal disc
 fastened to
 the wall in the same place would work just as well to
 protect the wall and allow the pipe to
 exit the cabin. Should be no
 harder
 to close up when not needed than the permanent pipe I was
 going
 to use and take less space.
 
 It doesn't look
 like I will get to float this boat this year but even
 if I don't, I could still sit inside
 it and pretend even in the winter
 if
 there was a heater. I didn't do it yet but I have been
 tempted to
 "camp out" in this
 thing while it is still in the workshop. I'm
 thinking of my boat as an amphibian camper
 and will likely camp on it
 as much on
 dry land away from water as I do actually ON the water or
 pulled up on shore.
