I have just ordered mine for 300ukp ($500 ?).

It was the same price either white or tan (I've gone for tan) and whatever weight I wanted (I've gone for 6oz).

Seems about average for a sail of this type. If you were to get a kit from Sailrite it would run around $223 for a 3.9 ounce weight white sail, and at least a hundred dollars more for the 4.9 ounce weight sail. I would imagine that if you just bought the materials yourself, you could build this 101 square foot sail in 5 ounce weight sail cloth for around $250 dollars. Of course that means you need to have a decent sewing machine as well as the time to do it.
