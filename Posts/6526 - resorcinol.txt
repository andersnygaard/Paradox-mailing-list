Subject: resorcinol

I ordered a gallon of resorcinol today from CP Adhesives.

Will be using it to glue the scarph joint for the 3/4" (18mm) panels. If all goes well, I will use resorcinol for most of my wood to wood bonding.

I have a question for the accomplished paradox builders. How did y'all go about scarphing the 1/2" (12mm) side panels? Did you scarph full panels?

I don't think I'm smart enough to scarph partial panels, and if I use full panels, I'll need at least one more extra 1/2" sheet?

Respectfully,
