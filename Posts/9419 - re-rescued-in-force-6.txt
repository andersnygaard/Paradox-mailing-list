Hi,

I am afraid of rot too. I resined the foam, polyurethane type foam the stuff they make surfboards from. It=E2=80=99s good to work with and you can sand it to exact shape so no moisture can get in.

The water tank is a plastic one I had made. Folk who make water tanks for off road vehicles made it the shape I needed to fit exactly under the floor in the space the plan shows it. It holds 70 litres. I fill a two-litre bottle from it each morning before moving sailing each day. It does make some odd sounds half full even with a baffle plate in it, but it can stand the force of a car driving over it, so it=E2=80=99s strong enough. I surrounded the gap on either side with foam too, after cutting it to shape and resin coating it all over. It=E2=80=99s brittle but it fills the void and helps with flotation in an emergency.

Hope someone is out sailing a Paradox right now.

Nick
