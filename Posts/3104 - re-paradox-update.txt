Subject: Re: Paradox update

At long last I've updated the Paradox web site.

http://www.paradox-uk.co.uk/

It now includes a couple of pictures of my first efforts at building my Paradox - so far, just the deck beams, cabin beams and hatch beams.

If you know of people who are building Paradoxes who are not mentioned on this page,
http://www.paradox-uk.co.uk/names.htm
you may like to give me their details.

Cheers,
Bill.

The same photos have been posted to the photos section of:
