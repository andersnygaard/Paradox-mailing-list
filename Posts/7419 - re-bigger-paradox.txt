Subject: Re: Bigger Paradox

No Problem Chris,
     As someone who has actually built and sailed a paradox and know Matt Layden personally I can assure you that you would have his blessing. He once told me that Paradox was infinitely scale-able (the caveat is having the knowledge to know how to address the myriad problems associated with an increase in scale). As a former professional boat builder I understand how to move bulkheads and where to add needed support in new areas and how to calculate new sail area and how to adjust displacement in order to maintain displacement ratios etc. I'm truly surprised at the number of people who will weigh in with advise on a subject without doing any real research on or really knowing what they are talking about. Be aware also of the academics who possess knowledge with no practical experience. Theory is fine until you get out there and find it doesn't apply to your situation. Only through experience, which, judging by your website, you have in spades, can you truly begain to understand what is important to your situation and what is not. Good luck on your upcoming adventure, I for one applaud you.
Glen
