I'd drop the chine runners and stick with the bilge boards. The chine runners create drag which makes moving under paddle/yuloh power much harder. I'm convinced that most of the leeway prevention in a Paradox is coming from the rudder not the chine runners. In my opinion, they're on a Paradox because they protect the chines when drying out (Autumn Leaves has a keelson) and they, along with the strongly curved part of the hull at the transom, help to keep the forefoot from plowing when surfing down waves. They obviously provide some form of leeway prevention too, but I think that's a minor benefit. Many people seem to consider chine runners as magical and therefore no keel is required (I did too until I actually began sailing a Paradox), but a Paradox's rig is set so far back, the rudder is doing most of the work which is why it's partially balanced. The lower gudgeon and pintle is designed to take much more load than is normal for a rudder on a boat that size.
