Monroe or to be precise, Ralph(The Commodore) M.Monroe only had one sharpie similar to the hull shape of PARADOX and that was KINGFISHER, which he had built to a local design and delivered to Florida by steamer.
This new boat proved quite successful and later after being sold a new boat, EGRET, and built to a Monroe design that could be described at best as KINGFISHERS offspring, only with a lot more flare, almost dory like, and being a double ender.
Phil Bolger sharpies. 
Nothing like PARADOX the shape of which is more akin to the original sharpies of over 100 years ago but with more freeboard for her length.

I will look for the Monroe you are speaking of on the web. Having once owned a Drascombe Lugger, I myself never gave much thought to a small sharpie off shore. But they do seem easier to build. I was looking at Nancy s China, Glen L 17, Glen L Minuet, etc.  I like the idea of small and able to get out of a knock down fairly easily.

I think its more Monroe's sharpie that is the inspiration for the paradox.

I am building a stitch and glue sharpie with chine runners, inspired
by Matt's designs. I had some ideas that I wanted to try out and
decided to design a boat on my own. If you want a boat quickly and
with assurance that it will work well, follow the plans. If you have
done some boat design and built a few boats, it might be fun to design
your own.
