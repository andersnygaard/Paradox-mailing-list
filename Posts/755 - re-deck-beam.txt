Subject: Re: Deck Beam


This is a good question.  The part has to take nails and hold them, and the plywood laminate veneers will work well for this.  Many of the beams are glued to bulkheads, and serve to spread out the load and stress between the deck and bulkhead.  Since they will be epoxied to bulkheads, I am not too concerned about flexing.  There are a couple of intermediate deck beams that are on their own.  The first part that I made flexed a little but not much, with all of my weight on it.  I find it hard to believe a solid part would do much better.

This brings me to a decision about the Build Book I started writing (see Files/BuildBook).  I may be building the boat differently than others.  My focus is on simple and tough.  I don't intend to write a book about "this is the only way to build the Paradox".  But the book has to reflect how I build the boat, because I don't want to speculate how others might have done something, I only want to write about what I know works (hopefully!).  So maybe I need to call it Paul's Build Book or something to show that it is just one way to put this thing together.

I used to work at S2 Yachts and worked on a couple of new models, and put together build books.  A build book is nothing fancy, really, its just notes from a builder on what he did, so that the next boat goes together faster.  I found the plans for Paradox detailed and difficult at first.  I think more people might be encouraged to build the boat with a build book.  Plus its a good reference for me, I can write up a step and print it out, and refer to it in the workshop.  I may just write up the first steps to get started and let the reader take it from there.

Anyway, I think the ply beams are going to work, and I finally made some sawdust.
