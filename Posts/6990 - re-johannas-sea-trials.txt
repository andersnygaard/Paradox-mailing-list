Nice report, Pete. Glad you had a good time.

We must try to get together with Jim and have a class meeting somewhere. I look forward to sailing alongside a Mk2 sail, Both Faith and LJ have the Mk1 version.

I have just come back from a splendid DCA weekend in the Falmouth area. The sail back from Helford on Sunday had a forecast of F5-F7.
Fortunately it never got above F5 while I was on the water.
