Bill, wonderful stuff. I plan to follow along vicariously on your adventure. You write very well.

In reading your blog, I discovered that you have an Asus eee. I've considered one as well, because of the presumed durability of the machine, but a cheap full-featured laptop isn't a great deal more than the Asus, and as I understand it, the latter has no optical drive. I'd like to be able to play DVDs-- I can get a half-dozen compressed movies and many many hours of music on a single DVD, which might prove entertaining.

Now if I can only find room for the wine cellar and the hot tub aboard my microcruiser.

Maybe not a cellar, but a mount to hold a "winemaid" bag should be easy to build into one of the side bins, and would give you wine "on tap!" In my opinion, an occasional glass or two at anchor while watching the sun set would make it well worth the trouble.
