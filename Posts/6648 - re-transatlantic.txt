A few months back there was a BBC southwest programme about the Tamar Valley.There was a couple of seconds of footage,taken from Saltash, showing Faith sailing just downstream of the Tamar Bridge.
So;make that 7 seconds of fame.
Not to mention the google earth picture at Ridge.
That boat is becoming a media hog!!
