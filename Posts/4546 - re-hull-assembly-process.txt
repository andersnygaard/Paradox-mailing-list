Subject: Re: Hull assembly process

I think the important thing is doing a good dry fit with the major nail holes drilled.  Make sure the boat is square at that stage.  It's important to have the temporary cleats/blocks angled to fit the frames/bulkheads so that they are at right angles to the centre line.  Another tip is to devise a system that best suits your for springing the bow and stern sections in.  I used a combination of straps, ropes, clamps and shaped wooden blocks.

Before doing the wet fit arrange every item within easy reach.  Start by fitting the side panels to frame 3; then 2, followed by 4.  Next do 1 and the transom. Finally fit the stem.  First I applied epoxy to frames 3,2 and 4 and to the panels where these frames meet; then I nailed them in place.  Further epoxy was applied for 2 and 4 before fixing them.  I epoxied the transom separately and fixed it before doing the stem.  All of this was done in one session which was of about 2 hours duration.

As I had sorted out the symmetry at the dry fix stage, the wet assembly automatically went into place.  I checked with a line down the centre of the boat and found no adjustments were needed.

My temporary cleats/blocks were srewed in place prior to assemly at the dry fit stage and remained in place until the epoxy had set at the wet stage.  To prevent the temporary cleats/blocks from sticking to the side panels and frames/bulkheads I sheathed them with plastic bin liner.

Wishing you the best,

Bill.
