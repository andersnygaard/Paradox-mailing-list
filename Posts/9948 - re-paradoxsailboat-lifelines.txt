I trailed a bright yellow ski tow rope when off shore
It was long enough for me to hit the water and swim like mad toward it
The boat will almost always broach and not go that far after you get wet
I had a line tied to my jacket, if I got up and was out of the hatch and at sea I was tethered
Getting back on board in rough water is a challenge with a fat life jacket on too
Practice it in the calm water and get accustomed to boarding from the water 
That said I never fell off in five years of sailing about

Recently finished my Paradox and sailed it in the Fall of 2022. Sails great and I felt very secure while in the boat. My concern is when I am on deck. Has anyone put any kind of lifelines/pulpits on their Paradox? I would think the occasion to go on deck would be rare, but I would like to know I could if needed. Even being on deck while docking and loading onto the trailer seemed a bit perilous.
Thanks,
