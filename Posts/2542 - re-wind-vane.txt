Subject: Re: wind vane

Glen, maybe I missed something. Why are building a windvane for Paradox when you have a perfectly good electric autopilot? Is it because you want a backup or do you feel that a windvane is a more reliable method of steering the boat? On Little Cruiser I usually have Mindy along to help out; however, if I take a long trip in Swamp Thing by myself someday, I may also have to consider some sort of autopilot. Anyway, I look forward to seeing what you have come up with for ZOE.
