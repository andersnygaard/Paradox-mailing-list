I think I agree that the chine curvature has little to do with the effect, since pitching would constantly alter the orientation of the curvature in relation to the movement of the boat.

In the Latest News section of Dave and Mindy Bolduc's www.microcruising.com site, there is a link to the building of the Mini-Paradox, in which the chine runner details are set forth very clearly, for those who are interested.  I didn't find this until after I'd asked you about the chine runners.

Glen, if you were experimenting with a catamaran and chine runners, would you put them on both sides of both hulls?
