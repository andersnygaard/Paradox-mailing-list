Alan,
    
I am looking at different types of boomkins for the Paradox junk rig, but don't have a satisfactory solution yet.  My original thinking was to attach it to the rudder, which has been done on other boat. 

You could always build an arch.  It would have to be light, but the sheet forces are so low with a junk that probably even a tubing arch would be fine.
