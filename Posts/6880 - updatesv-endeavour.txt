My Fellow Paradoxians,

Just a brief line to update all on the construction of my Paradox, ENDEAVOUR.

Deck beams are complete (all seven!) and the first 2 bulkheads are cut awaiting their adornment of cleating.  I have had a few days off and was able to accomplish alot of the "little stuff" that goes into making a Paradox.  To me, this is the easy stuff...basic lay-out, cut, and assemble...then there's all that glassing and finish work, (sand, sand, sand, and when you think it's good to go...sand 5 more times) but I have no deadline for this project and each and every part, piece, nut, bolt, nail, screw, epoxy batch, and glass application will be as close to perfection as I am capable of producing.

This is my "Mount Everest".....and the climb has begun...

Safe Passages To All
Greg
