If one is to gather from the beam increase that the foam in use is 1" thick, that is one heck of a stiff hull construction for such a small boat. You could use that on a 50 foot hull. What it is like, is a helmet inside out, lightish scrim of strechy dacron outside, heavy glass inside, and lots of crushable foam.

Dyvinicell isn't closed cell is it? one could have similar water problems to wood if the core was ever exposed...
