Subject: Sheer strakes and Chine logs

What exactly do these do in a Paradox?
Are they there purely for driving ring nails into? if so, can I use any old pine (well epoxied). 
I am reluctant to use Douglas Fir given how much the unplaned lengths for the spars have 
just cost me and it seems to me that modern boat builders would just use a strong epoxy 
fillet in place of them. I'd be happy to rip lengths of an exterior ply sheet and laminate 
those together.
Any helpful thoughts anybody?
Cheers.....Derek
