Alexander,

Let me just say that ODYSSEY is one beautiful boat! I am very impressed with your attention to details such as the electrical panel and those teak decks really blew me away!  I'm starting my PARADOX this month and I have added ODYSSEY to the list of boats I'm using to set the example for mine.  You have really set the bar high for me and anyone else wanting to go above and beyond.  But hopefully by this time next month I'll be posting pic's from my build and hounding guys like you for input and direction.  Once again, thanks for sharing your exquisite nautical craftiness with us all...

Safe Passages To All,
Greg
