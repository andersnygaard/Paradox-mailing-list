Interesting topic.
I've built my Paradox Odyssey standard size with minor modifications (see pics in the folder and videos on Youtube), launched in 2010. So far, I have gone through two extended cruises up US East Coast (North Carolina-New Jersey 500 n.m. and New Jersey-Rhoad Island 250 n.m.).

I am somewhat large guy 6'3", 215-220lbs and I carry all the food, water, cooking gear, cloth, the whole nine yards with me. I'll tell you, I am happy with the size the way it is.

In fact I would not want it to be bigger. It would be less cozy and more difficult to control. With the larger beam, you will no longer be safely snug and bounce between the cabin walls when it heels or rolls in a big surf.

Bigger boat will require bigger sail, hence bigger loads on the lines, bigger and heavier mast will be problematic to slide in and pull out while on the water (to clear low bridges).
It will need bigger anchor, bigger ballast, bigger trailer, bigger vehicle to pull (right now I am pulling with Volsvo S40 no problem) etc.

And of course, it will be much more expensive to build.

I can not think of a single reason why bigger Paradox will be better for a single cruiser.

I understand. But'm shipbuilder and often receive inquiries from people who do not like or know built sailing, but want to start modifying a project that took several years to reach the spot. Boats things always seem easy to be modified, when the reality is quite different. Increasing the size of Paradox could be worth another look most appropriate design needs. Unless time and money is not an obstacle, or even the risk of creating something unsafe.
That's only because I deal with a board boats for over 40 years. Every thing that you modify on a boat, is reflected in all the others. It has good larger projects. If you increase 30 cm in Paradox, but gives little benefit means a considerable increase in volume that will require a considerable increase in sail area, ballast for little benefit. think about it
