Hi Matt,

That's great news about your start at building a Paradox.  Mine now has her bottom well and truly fixed!  I've just completed the chine runners; next will be glassing the bottom.  Unfortunately, I'll have to stop building for the next 2 months, because I'll be away in Australia.

I was hoping to meet Andrew Graham there and see his Paradox, but although I sent him a couple of emails, I've not as yet received a reply.

Cheers,
Bill.
