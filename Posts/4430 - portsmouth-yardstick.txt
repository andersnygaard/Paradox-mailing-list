Subject: Portsmouth Yardstick

I was wondering if the Paradox will ever get a registered Portsmouth Yardstick rating?

This score is a handicap rating used so that sailboats of vastly different designs can compete on a level playing field against one another. It is used for one-design boats.

I wonder if the Paradox hull and standard sail could get a Portsmouth rating so that it could be raced against other boats. I am entering a small lake race that uses the Portsmouth system, but since my boat is home built (canoe w/ foam/fiberglass pontoons), it doesn't have a Portsmouth rating. It will be just for fun, since I really have no chance of placing without a Portsmouth.

I was thinking of building a puddle duck racer (PDRacer.com), only because it DOES have a portsmouth (the slowest rating I have ever seen, 140)
