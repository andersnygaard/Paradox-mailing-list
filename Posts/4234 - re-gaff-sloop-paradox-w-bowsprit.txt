Subject: Re: Gaff Sloop Paradox w/ Bowsprit?

Read you state regulations for specifically what is considered hull and how it is measured. In Texas bowsprits and bumkins do not count as part of the "hull" the way it reads.

Funny that you guys should bring up a bowsprit...  I was checking our a hinged anchor roller system last night.  How else can you keep from scratching up the bow when you bring your anchor back aboard?  Then I realized that it would increase the LOA of the boat and in some states anything over 14 feet requires registration.  At 13' 10" and no engine you need not register a Paradox in Florida, Alabama, and Texas.
