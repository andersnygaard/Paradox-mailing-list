With 'Faith' the weight is borderline for an unbraked trailer. I took the whole lot top a public weighbridge just out of curiosity and it came out at 760 kg with food and basic gear, but without water in the tanks- just over the legal limit for the UK. I from then onwards have loaded the heavy gear after arriving at the slip in an attempt to remain legal.

As I mentioned previously, there are issues with my trailer suspension units starting to crack their housings and a very hard and bumpy ride. It would make launching and recovery less fraught if the boat could be towed on the highway fully loaded with food and all gear and save delay at the slip. If you have a poke around the internet you'll find stories from other boat users who have had major problems with these Indespension Units. It seems that the load ratings advertised by the vendors are optimistic.

A new home brewed trailer is in the pipeline for 'Faith' which will have leaf spring suspension and also brakes which work going forwards and backwards.
