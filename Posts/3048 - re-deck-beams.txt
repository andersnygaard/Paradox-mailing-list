Subject: Re: Deck Beams

Hi Bill

I left each of my beams for 24 hours but patience has never been one of my virtues :0)

I had my sail made by Jekylls of Wroxham, if that's any help.

I've got to make the big decision in a couple of hours whether to totally strip the bottom or chance epoxing over the top. At the moment it looks like stripping off, but I am determined to have a peaceful sabbath!

I hope that all goes well ......  Derek
