At long last my Paradox micro-cruiser has been 'born'. She's left the garage/womb and entered life on dry land/front lawn, waiting for her initiation/baptism which will take place in a few days when she enters her element/seawater at Burnham-on-Crouch.

To see a photo of her in all her glory (less rudder and rig) visit:
