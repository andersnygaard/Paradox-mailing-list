That 400lbs of lead took forever (2 days!) to (s)melt and by the time I added some to the rudder and accounted for the losses due to sweeping the dross off the surface (most of my lead was painted roofing iron. I had six sacks of it)  I ended up with 300lbs.  Some lessons learned:

1. Low pressure LPG isn't hot enough to do the job.
2. A simple forge using a square of bricks with a cast iron frypan on top, a vacuum cleaner for draught and DRY firewood almost gets you there but you also need supplementary heat from above and it wouldn't have worked if there had been any wind about.
3. I used a general purpose propane torch to melt down the larger lumps of lead to get them closer to the surface of the frypan.
4. Anything more than a 15lb ingot is too heavy to safely pour into the mold from a cast iron frypan which already weighs 7lbs.
5. The ingots retain their heat for a long time and the fumes coming off the painted lead are definitely very bad. Anybody following in my footsteps, make sure you are wearing a face mask with the correct filters (forget a dust mask. You need to filter out the vapours), goggles, no bare skin and heavy (did I say heavy - I wore rubberised gloves inside and leather gloves outside and I still burnt my fingers picking up an ingot too soon) gloves.
6. Lead ingots hardly take up any space once they've been melted down!
