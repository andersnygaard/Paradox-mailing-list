I use a 3.3 Hp Evinrude in Cachivache and has enough power to overcome the strong current of the river and quiet step foreplay at its mouth.

I use a 2.3 hp Honda and find it more than enough. The lighter the engine the better as extra weight aft is not desirable.

The problem is mounting it so that the mainsheet doen't get caught up when you tack or gybe.

I've altered the lead of the mainsheet so that it goes through the aft deck instead of the transom but it still can get tangled around the engine if I don't pay attention, as Alastair can attest.

Best

Hi, 

I will use my Paradox the first years mostly on the channels and Rivers in Europe. Sailing is not allowed on those waterways!

So my question is, which is the right engine for a full (heavy) loaded Paradox? I was thinking of an 5 Hp Honda...

Regards Chris
