Subject: Re: Questions regarding Paradox plans.

Yeah, I noticed that after I posted the list of questions.  I've
been over that page several times but didn't see it for some
reason.

I wonder if the dimensions change at all with the new sail Matt
specs of Paradox?

Your description makes it easier to understand the page 12, but
I'm sure I'll still have more questions about it once I get up to
it (still stuck on page 7 for now.)

Thans again for your help.
