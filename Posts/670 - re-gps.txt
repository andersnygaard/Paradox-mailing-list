I Can highly recommend the Garmin name David, I've am still using my GPS 45 which is over eight years old and the newer ones are much better,smaller and less expensive. I have the mariner and I believe the only difference between it and the plain Terex is that the mariner has all the nav aids in the USA pre-programmed. It's kind of neat to be sailing along watching the screen and all of a sudden a marker or buoy pops up as it comes into range. A quick glance at the chart and sure enough there it is.
