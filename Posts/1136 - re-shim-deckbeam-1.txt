DC, 

I have been trying to recall if I had any problems with the deck beams on Zoe and I don't believe so. How are you mounting the beams to the shear clamp? I mounted mine by cutting an angled trough into the clamp and then a matching angle on the beams. This allows for raising or lowering the beam (always start out too high) to its correct height. I do seem to recall getting a little too low on one of them but I just held it in place with a screw nail until the epoxy (thickened to peanut butter consistency) hardened. I have learned there is a lot of truth in the boat builders jingle "putty and paint will make her what she ain't". 

Tailwinds, 

Glen
