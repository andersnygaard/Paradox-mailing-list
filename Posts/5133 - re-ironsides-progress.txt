Steve,
Thanks for the updates.

We're not that far apart in our construction progress.
I'm getting pretty close to finishing off the interior.
I've got about 75% of the paint and varnish work complete.
I put a final lick of paint on the cabin sole this evening, so I'm 
just left to do the lazarete area and bins and the painting will be  
complete. The vent trunk needs installing, but it's all built and 
should be quick enough to glue in place.
I've insatlled foam all round the hull. It's held in place by battens 
and it has been a labour of love installing them (not quite all done 
yet!) I've used a fairly rigid styrofoam because it's all I could 
find, but I hope to get my hands on a softer and more robust 
styrofoam eventually. The current stuff is quite easy to damage.
The decks have all been cut to size and have been temporarily 
installed and removed. Once the internlas are done, Ill be glueing 
them on.
I can then make a start at the cabin top. I've already laminated all 
the beams for this and prepared some of the other joinery as well.

Like you I've got to sheath the whole lot and that means a couple of 
turn overs.
I'll probably build a rolling frame to make this an easier task.

Everything is conspiring against me this summer. I don't seem to be 
able to find a lot of spare time. It now looks like it will be a real 
effort to finish before winter arrives so I'm really aiming at a 
launch dtae of spring 2009. I'd really always expected to take 2 
years to complete the boat anyway.

I'll hopefully get some photo's of how she looks in the next few days 
and I'll post them on  here.

regards

Pete
