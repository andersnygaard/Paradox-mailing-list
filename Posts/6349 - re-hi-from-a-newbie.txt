Hi Pete,

Thanks for the welcome, I see how the chine runners work now, what a cracking idea! The little Silhouettes are good boats, especially the MK3s, the MK2s are not so hot....
I am in Bideford in North Devon, so not so far from you. it's amazing where folks pop up from on these Yahell groups innit? On the other group I frequent, we have members from all over the world, I expect you do here as well. I am not so sure that a Paradox would suit me really, I am a big bloke, and I think I might have trouble putting one on! Something Paradoxish, a bit bigger, say 16 foot long and a bit wider would probably be better for me. The junk sail and mast I have by me would do for a boat that size just as well.

Cheers,
Charlie.
