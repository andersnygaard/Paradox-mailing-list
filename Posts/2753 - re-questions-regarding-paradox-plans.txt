The spar sizes are the same for both sail plans. If you go with the up dated plan you will be able to cut off about 8" of the boom if memory serves but don't do it until the sail has been installed and the boom measured against it. I have had both sail plans on Zoe and if it wasn't for the fact that the first was too flat, I may still be using it. It is for sale to anyone wanting to have some more draft put into it.
