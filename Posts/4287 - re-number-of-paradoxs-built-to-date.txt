Hi David,

I will also be at Cedar Key, arriving a few days early. It  just doesn't 
make sense to drive for two days in each direction for a two day event. 
I have reservations arriving in CK on Monday 4/30 and departing on 5/7. 
I will be bringing my new Hobie Adventure Island and hopefully will have 
a chance for a test sail or two before leaving Maryland.

Ron
