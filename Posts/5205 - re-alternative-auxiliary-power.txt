Subject: Re: Alternative auxiliary power...

In my previous tirade I forgot to mention shore power.

If one goes electric you will certainly have to carry a smart charger
and some way to safely connect it to shore power, which really adds up
cost wise.

But the biggest cost is renting a slip in order to connect up to shore
power. And what do you do if all the slips are full and your batteries
are getting empty? Rental slip fees will more than eliminate any savings
from using solar energy to keep the batteries charged. Besides, solar
cells will not re-charge deep-cycle batteries in any timely fashion - to
the degree that a trolling motor uses it.

I already have a 1250 watt Kawasaki 4-stroke genset, two deep-cycle
batteries , 4 solar panels, controller/regulator and smart charger and
all I need is the trolling motor. (The torqedo is state of the art so I
am told.)My little gas outboard would be pretty hard to give up though.

One drawback for me is the sound of the genset as it runs at a constant
rpm level that is not bad in the city but out in the big wide open - it
really sounds annoying compared to a small outboard running at about 1/3
throttle.
