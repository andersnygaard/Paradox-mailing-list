Subject: Re: Roller reefing hull attachment?

Hi Bill.

Take a look at George Van Sickle's blog on building the Enigma 460.
http://e460.blogspot.com/
In his 25 February 2009 entry, you can see a nice picture of the roller reefing drum. (click on the picture and you will see an enlarged picture). Hope that helps.

If I don't build Enigma, I'm looking at maybe buying an old Potter 15
