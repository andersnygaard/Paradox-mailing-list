I've been working on the stern baffle for my Paradox and I note there would appear to be little clearance for the mast, boom, yard and sail to pass through the transom hatch and over the top of the baffle. This raises the question, "How practical is this system for storing the spars and sail when on the road?" Do most people just stow the mast inside the boat while leaving the boom, yard and sail on the side deck?

A disadvantage of storing the mast inside the boat is the necessity to remove it before one can use the boat as a `caravan' when travelling to new cruising grounds by road. It can't be all that easy to get the mast in and out of the boat.

I notice that Andrew Graham, who has `Zero' in Australia, carries his mast on top of the cabin by using a removable crutch at the bow, but to enter the cabin he must first undo lashings holding the mast, then put it to one side before he can enter the cabin through the hatch.

All this is causing me to consider not installing a transom hatch. The only other use I can see for it is additional ventilation, and in the UK such an arrangement would seldom be necessary. Indeed, Al has mentioned that ventilation through the vent box is sometimes more than is required causing him to stuff a towel in the opening.

What are your thoughts on spar and sail stowage when the boat is on the road and is the transom hatch worth having?
