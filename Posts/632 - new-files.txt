Hello All,

There have been repeated queries about how large Paradox is and how big a crew she will handle. I have just uploaded some pictures of my self sitting in Zoe to give everyone a feel for just how big she is inside, they are in the Interior folder in the files section. I also uploaded some pictures of my solution to a chart table  to the Chart Table folder where you will find another picture of me sitting at the table. After viewing these images you should be able to figure out how many close (intimate) friends you want to go sailing with.

Tailwinds,
Glen
