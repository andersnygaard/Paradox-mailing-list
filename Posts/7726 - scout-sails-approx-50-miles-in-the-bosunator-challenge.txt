Subject: Scout sails approx 50 miles in the Bosunator Challenge

Scout and I shared our first real challenge. We sailed an approx 50 miles course (including tacking) engine-less the other day. 8 other boats joined us for the "Bosunator Challenge. It was about half downwind and half upwind. We had conditions ranging from flat calm to 26mph apparent. in the heavier breezes, downwind we had extended runs of 5.3 knots with a max of 5.6. 

Upwind Scout did well, but a large wind chop had built that really killed the speed. Nevertheless, she pointed pretty well in challenging conditions for making progress to windward. Overnight we had a full moon, the wind backed off to about 10-13 and the water flattened out. It was stunningly beautiful as we tacked back up the Colorado River. Numerous times we had the coyotes on shore howling and the burros braying, I took it as them cheering us on..LOL The wind was calm at the start and at the end of the challenge. All in all I paddled/yulohed Scout for about 10 miles. I switched off between a stand-up paddleboard paddle which worked great and the yuloh. With the paddle, I could maintain almost 2 knots for extended times....slightly less with the yuloh, The combination of the 2 gave me a chance to switch muscle groups and standing positions and made the paddling much more tolerable. Time on course was about 20 hours. Got a lot of info for things I want to tweak and or modify in the future. I will cover the whole deal in my blog today, including linking the 2 videos.
