Subject: 2 questions: stem and chine runners

Thanks for the plans, David.

On drawing #11, chine runner details, are the longitudinal offsets at bulkheads 2,3 and 4 defined similarly as these respective bulkheads corners - that is aft face of blk2 and fwd faces of 3 and 4; Is this assumption correct?

Also, I could not find the longitudinal offset of the foot of the stem; I calculated that from the measured angle off drawing #2 (12deg) but I was wandering if I missed it;  

Thank you.

On a personal note, I've read all the messages over the holidays and it was like watching a good movie; I couldn't put the laptop down with the spam threat of 2002 and the flame wars; I never build more than bookshelves from Ikea but I feel encouraged by people like Al who managed the project fine. 

Thanks again.
