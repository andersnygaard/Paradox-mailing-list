Subject: Re: How to attach an anchor to Paradox

I have the same setup as Al, but in practice I prefer a different system. I lay my anchor while standing in the cabin by feeding the rode (anchor line) from a bucket to the starboard hand side. I then take the rode forward and hook it over the starboard fore cleat. When I'm back in the cabin I adjust the length of the rode and make it secure to the aft starboard cleat.

Retrieving the anchor is easily done by first shaking the rode free from the fore cleat, then hoisting the anchor while standing in the cabin and feeding the rode into the bucket.  Finally, the anchor is stored in the bucket with the rode and secured at the forward end of the cabin on the starboard side.

Using this system the anchor and rode can be cleaned as they are lifted from the water.

If I am anchoring for a long period I feed the rode through the starboard fairlead and put anti-chafing material on it, i.e., a bit of cloth.

If I judge the conditions are too rough for using my preferred system I resort to Al's method, which has the advantage that it is not necessary to go up on deck.

Bill.
