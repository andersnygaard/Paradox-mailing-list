well, I just looked at the frontspiece, and his "second" book was actually whutten before "The Sharpie Book". It's called "The New Cold-Molded Boatbuilding" (from lofting to launching) Hardbound 1990, paperback 1992. ISBN   0-8742-358-X

I think I got my copy at Powell's City of Books in Portland, OR. The do on line sales at www.powells.com 

It describes a method of building Sharpies with plywood slab sides and arched bottoms. Basically, you run 2 layers of planks at 45 degrees to each other to build up the bottom. These are big boats, 35 to 50 feet

I have used a similar method on kayaks that used 3/8" strips with coopered edges  to buikd up the bottom and once put 2 layers of this on a small skiff and liked the result. I was able to build the bottom in 2 days including routing the strip edges.
