Subject: Plywood?

Hello everyone,

I just recently received the plans and build book for the Paradox. I plan on starting my build in the spring or summer of 2015. My question is about plywood selection and what has everyone else used for plywood on their boats. I plan on using the boat to sail to the Bahamas and along the Atlantic coast. Just wanted to see what type of plywood everyone else has used.

Thanks,

Jason
