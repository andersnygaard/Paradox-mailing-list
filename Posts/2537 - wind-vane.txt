Subject: wind vane

Glenn,

In post 2556 you mentioned, in passing, that you have done some work on a wind vane for Zoe. I (and others, too, I'm sure) am interested in whatever you find to work, and also what doesn't work. I realize that you are working on your farm/house now, but whenever you have something to share about your wind vane experiences, I'd certainly like to benefit from your experience and expertise.

Steve
