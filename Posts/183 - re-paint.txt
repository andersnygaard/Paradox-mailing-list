Rolling and Tipping is a painting technique where by you roll the paint on in one direction and tip it with a brush in the other to smooth and remove air bubbles left by the roller.

For my Paradox I used a foam roller, which I cut in half, and rolled thin coats on vertically from sheer to water line and about 15" wide then with a 3" foam brush I lightly brushed (tipped) in the direction from wet to dry. In other words if I had started at the bow the brush strokes were from stern to bow. Many paints flash off quickly and the trick to a smooth finish is to keep a wet edge, so don't do to big a section before tipping it. Try the technique on some scrap until you get the hang of it. Be aware that the foam brushes wear down fast so have one in your pocket so you can discard the bad and keep going. I was able to get by with one brush per coat but I had two spares in my pockets just in case. If you have to go find a brush you will lose your wet edge. Also after each stroke flip the brush to the other side during the back stroke. Only stroke the paint in one direction. There are different schools of thought on whether you should roll vertically and tip horizontally or the other way around, the choice is yours, I personally prefer to roll vertically.

Here is another trick I learned many years ago. If you're using an oil base paint, instead of cleaning up the roller and brush between coats or discarding them, immerse them under water so air cant get to the surface of the roller or brush. Next day just shake off the water and your ready to go again. I  usually roll the roller across news paper to insure the water is off. I have only used one roller and paint brush for doing bottom jobs for as long as I can remember now.
