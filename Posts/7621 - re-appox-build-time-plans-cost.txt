Subject: Re: Appox build time, plans, cost??

Thanks kbgwp!!!

I just ordered the plans from Dave Bolduc (http://www.microcruising.com/)

They are not actually listed for sale on his site but if you E-mail him, he will send you the ordering information.

In his message to me he wrote:

I still distribute the Paradox plans for Matt Layden at a cost of $40,
which includes postage anywhere in the world. Payments can
be made by check, cash or Paypal at mbolduc@triad.rr.com. The plans
consist of 12 pages of nicely detailed drawings on 11" x 17" paper; 
however,
they do not include any step-by-step instructions. Therefore, I'd 
recommend
that you get Don Elliott's Paradox Builders manual, which will give you an
excellent idea of what is involved in this intermediate boat building
project.

Hello all,
I suppose this is answered somewhere but I can't find the info. Does anyone have an approximate build time for a Paradox? I have the basic stitch and glue building skills. I've looked at the few plan pages I've found on-line and and my guess is about 300hrs to get a basic sailing boat.

Also what is an estimated build materials cost, East Coast USA? Can anyone supply me a materials list?

Next, where can I buy plans? i tried the contact in the FAQ section of this site and the link doesn't work.

Thanks
Edward
