Having just got back from a 4 day trip I read this with interest as I had just decided that I would get myself an outboard. There were 2 reasons for this; I spent 3 hours within 2 miles of a safe haven fighting wind and tide (not in any danger as it happens, but the weather could have got worse) and the last mile up the river to the boatyard was AGAIN against wind and tide (gives me lots of practice with the yuloh, but I doubt if I shall be able to move my arms tomorrow). However I am determined to remain motor-free this year at least, though I may just have to change where I launch from.

Hi All,

I just got back from an overnighter on Whisper. I left the outboard home this time. I rigged a makeshift Yuloh using a Kayak paddle, It worked ok. A proper Yuloh will be my next project.

I was listening to Matt's opinion on motor's is the reason I left the outboard at home this time. It hit home with me. He said motors are fine as long as you understand they are a luxury and you don't depend on them to get you out of trouble. This is exactly what I was doing. I was using the outboard to make up for my lack of sailing experience. Experienced sailors know this, for me it was a valuable lesson. Thanks Matt !! I was surprised as to what I could do when I had too. Maybe someone else can learn from this also.
