I would be interested in looking at a picture of your trailer. It appears you have much thought and made effort to have a trailer that works well. I agree with your logic.

I am not sure of the protocol about a link of products but it is here for reference, for reference only -- I do not work for the company, nor have relatives or friends that work there:

It is an inflatable fender, that perhaps I could have several of these and then push/slide the paradox backwards off the trailer with hinge pin on the trailer released. Paradox can catch the rollers and I can continue moving the boat backwards. In my mind it is ever so easy.

I learned of bearings buddies this morning, which would be another improvement toward making the trailer better for the paradox.

So often the focus is on the boat, and like you mentioned, if it is easy to launch and retrieve your more apt to go out sailing.
