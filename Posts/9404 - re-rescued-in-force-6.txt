Hi

I eventually got it to work , and it was just finger trouble , I am not so good at computers And another nice guy posted it in full on a personal email to me

Good read Getting impatient has its consequences I suppose ?

I can kill time on my Paradox easily , I’m a good sleeper and love a nap and carry fishing gear with me as well as books There’s lots of room for all my distractionsI’ve drifted asleep a fair bit on calmer days and often have a nap on day sails Staying in port is something I have to keep reminding myself is part of sailing

Hope someone is out sailing somewhere right now

Nick

Hi Nick,
I just tried to open it..  Seems ok to me. Do you have an older version of Microsoft Word.  I am not the most tech savvy guy. Hope you can sort it out.
Cheers
