Subject: Re: Converting ballast tanks

Thanks John
I'm sure that my boat is overloaded anyway, as it is, with the water ballast tanks  full of sea water, so could do with some weight reduction.

Using the space for storage would enable me to move some of the existing  weight of stores, anchors, tools, food and drinking water to the lowest point, near the centre of the boat, where it would be more effective for sailing  stability.  

If I can resist the temptation to add yet more stuff  (difficult for me)., the trailing weight will stay the same, but the sailing displacement will be less than now, which for an overloaded boat is a Good Thing..

So, my aim is to improve the weight distribution without making the trailing weight heavier and have more volume for storage, while lightening the sailing displacement a little.

My trailer is very sturdy,  BTW..

Best
