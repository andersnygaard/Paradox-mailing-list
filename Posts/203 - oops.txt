Subject: Oops....

Slipped up on the math. A 10% increase in Paradox would yield a length of 15.2 feet or 15' 2 1/2", which is quite close in length to Little Cruiser. The 120 square feet should be just about right; however I really need to measure the sail to be sure. For those of you who are math wizards, I have uploaded the actual dimensions of Little Cruiser's sail into the file area. All measurements are in mm.
