Perhaps you can spare yourself any further consideration, depth of trunk or not... the Mirage simply will not be effective moving such a heavy boat (compared to the typical craft in which it is more than effective)

The reason the Paradox responds to the Yuloh is all in the lever arm length.

One of the big advantages of the Paradox is the 6ft x 3ft 6inch flat floor. It would be a shame to block it up with a pedal drive system. 
I did consider fitting a Hobi Mirage Drive to mine, but the trunk 
would have to be quite deep as the boat displaces 9 inches so I  abandoned it. The best solution I could come up with was to mount the 
drive under the aft deck, which is much shallower due to the rocker, 
and pedal facing backwards.
