Speaking of air guns, Admiral... I was in attendance at a professional 
basketball game last night and watched in amusement as the team mascot 
launched rolled t-shirts up into the furthest reaches of the arena with 
compressed air. The "gun" was powered by one of those, 3800 psi carbon 
jacketed air cylinders from a paint ball weapon. Impressive range and 
quite mobile.
