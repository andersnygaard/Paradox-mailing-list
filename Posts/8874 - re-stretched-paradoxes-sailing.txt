Hi Tom,

Weather conditions of 15 to 20 with gusts to 25, flat bottom, lightweight, and protected waters with minimal waves make it highly likely for a Paradox to get up on a plane. However, it would be interesting to see the tacking angle and VMG to windward. 

Regarding efficiency, it is more critical when there is no wind or wind speed ranges from 0-5. Sail shape and drag are crucial factors at this point. 

Of my 5 small boats, all sloops and under 19ft, none have a backstay (unless I count my 6th small boat, a 32inch RC boat which does have one). The forestay tension is maintained with slightly aft shrouds. Super high tension isn’t necessary. In fact, my FS runs with a loose rig, just not floppy, and a jib cut for it. Even the sung rig on an FS has only 80lbs to 120lbs on the forestay. 

While Tyvek sails are fun curiosities, they won’t win any races. 

The newer junks are well developed; however, well-sorted sloops are still quicker. It’s easy to overlook the slot effect, or the positive feedback circulation that occurs between the jib and main. Junks have their pros, such as reefing, but high efficiency is not one of them.

Best regards,
