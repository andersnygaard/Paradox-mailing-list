Hello,

Does anyone know the current status of the Paradox ref in the notice from the previous post?

This message board has a Paradox directory, and I believe it could use updates and added information regarding new builders and doxes transferred to new owners.

If you are not familiar with the directory, please take a moment to review. Within the directory, information about the builder, location, year launched, and owner are noted.

Best regards,

Deric Tallman
