Thanks for this... I woulda started with system three if I had known a place around here to get it. I am impatient when it comes to stuff like this.... I can wait forever for the project to end and take my time building but when I wanta work I hate waiting on an order to come in.

Rod - I built my Paradox entirely using System Three. For price, ease of mixing, and customer service I think it is hard to beat. As you are in Southern California you might also take a look at Aircraft Spruce based in Corona. They sell a wide range of structural epoxies and accessories, some perfectly suited for boatbuilding. They also sell System Three. Regards, Mark
