Hey Bill,
I'm afraid I'll be around for a while, the wife's illness steadily 
worsens and she now needs full time care which of course impacts 
building, sailing etc. The last time I got a chance to go out and 
test the vane the winds were light and the gear performed poorly if at 
all. I attribute this to the vane blade being too small so will enlarge 
it and give it another try. I have also had some minor trouble with 
assembly and am correcting them as they appear. I won't be doing any 
drawings until I get everything working correctly and dependably.   As has 
been mentioned the Paradox design is well balanced and will sail 
herself for long periods of time. However if you find yourself crawling around 
trying to find something she will be all over the place, thus the need 
for some sort of autopilot. I use an Autohelm 800 connected to the 
tiller lines and it works great but of course uses more power then I 
like. It is great for short trips but not for more then about three 
days. I made an adapter to connect to the tiller lines by drilling 
a hole in a large washer that would fit under the rod end fitting on 
the pilot. To the hole I attached a piece of line that I could tie to 
the tiller line with a rolling hitch. Of course you will need a line 
going fore and aft because you can’t push a rope. The pilot is mounted 
on the edge of the starboard aft locker using a cradle to support the 
outboard or rod end. The lines need to be long enough that you can slide 
the rolling hitches together to un-couple the pilot and then pull them 
away from each other and take out the slack in the tiller lines to 
couple. Sounds complex but is actually very simple. I’ll see if I can 
get a few pictures of the set up put together.
