Hi Nels,

I just today was discharged from the hospital my right tonsil became infected and closed my windpipe almost to the point of the pen in the chest move. The doctors are trying to detirmine when this started and whats causing the infection, my stamina and drive are just not there, but I should be on the mend and back at it soon.   

Sorry to hear that Jack. All the best for a speedy recovery.

Nels
