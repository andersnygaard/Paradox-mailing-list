Hello,

I ordered the plans from David Bolduc and I would like to have the building booklet from Wanda Elliott. I tried to contact her with three different addresses, but no one is in use. I sent an email to "Messing in about boats" magazine but it didn't work, nor could I find contact information in publishing media.

Can you help me get the right email for Wanda or maybe somebody wants to sell me the 16 parts of the booklet by PDF file? I will pay by PayPal.

Thank you,
