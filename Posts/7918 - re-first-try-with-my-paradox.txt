Great report Andre! Glad to hear the second time went so smooth. 

Yes, my thimble is on the starboard side of the strop.

On thing I did to the mainsheet attachment tang was to space it back behind the trailing edge of the boom with a couple of washers and then I use a nylock locking nut so that I can tighten it down just to the point it takes the slop out of the tang , but not have to tighten it any further and it will stay there and not loosen. I back it up with a locknut for extra safety. I also bent the tang below the boom to more closely match the angle that the mainsheet runs to it. .... I guess I should mention that instead of driving a bolt into the boom....I installed a stainless hanger bolt into the boom. The hanger bolt is a wood screw on one side, and machine threads on the the other....so it leaves a stainless machine threaded stud sticking out the back of the boom and then I use a nylock nut to be able to adjust how tight the mainsheet tang is held.
