Hi All,

I am sorry to report that Bert's furling idea does not work. As it turns out when you release the tack strop the furling drum line has nothing to work against (the reason for the tube attached to the axle) and no matter how hard you pull on the line nothing happens.

When you get to the part where you cut the pipe for the tack strop you might want to cut it a little long (2") because mine is to short to allow everything to swing up very easily. That is to say that the front of the sail when rolled up is very tight against the cabin side. After you see that you have clearance then trim any excess. Unfortunately I will have to buy an eight-foot piece of sch 40 brass pipe to make another fitting. Such is life.

Tailwinds,
Glen
