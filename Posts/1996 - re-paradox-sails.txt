Hi Jack,

Before you build your sails make sure you have your yard made because you will have to measure the deflection in it when hoisted to allow for the bend. Best to have both boom and yard built so as to make sure the sleeves will be more than adequate. 

My first sail was built by a so-called professional (even has a sail loft in St. Augustine) who didn't know to take into consideration yard bend. So $500 later I was ordering a new sail from Dabbler who does know how to build these sails and I am extremely pleased with the new one. 

If you have your yard built then support it by the ends on sawhorses, chair back etc. and hang fifty pounds in the center. Stretch a string tightly from each end and measure the deflection from the string to the yard at the 1/4, 1/2 and 3/4 points. Transfer these measurements to a paper pattern and you will have the shape of the top of the sail. Matt likes to add lots of draft into these sails and I would refer you to his comments in the New Sail folder in the files section for more info. 

This should get you started, I highly recommend the sail building manuals put out by Sail-rite.

Tailwinds,

Glen
