So the ideal solution would be to enjoy the removable rear window enhancement, bombined to a properly dimensioned interior for heavy weather sailing; Bearing in mind that if you entend to use a waps, series sea drogue or such from the stern if caught up in a gale, you should first test your rear window against hydro-pistoning by spraying it with a 15 foot/second waterjet, just to assure yourself that it will be watertight in a breakingwave strike whyle laying under the series sea drogue.

I too have considered converting to a removable rear window. One of my few criticisms is that you have to either be inside or outside with no in between.

As to the stability with the higher weight, On one of my trips I spent 15 hours sitting down on one passage. The next day I made the return passage in 7 hours, most of it standing up! I have since acquired better cushions! If the raised weight were a problem it would probably be time to retreat below.
