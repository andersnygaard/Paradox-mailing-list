Hi Guys,

This is getting quite far of the main topic but I was wondering...

Has anyone used an electric trolling motor,along with a small generator to top up the batteries? 

The smallest Honda generator would provide plenty of power to charge batteries. Looking at some chargers, small generators, and trolling motor power usage,it seems it would run pretty much as long as the gas held out in the generator. Of course it would run quite a distance on battery power alone, and be a lot more pleasant than running an outboard for short trips. 

The generator would allow charging batteries for other uses, and may as well use batteries for ballast instead of lead. The little generators weigh only about 29 lbs.and use .6 gal in 8 hours! Of course that run time would be under very light load.  

Negatives: There would have to be some sort of suitable locker built in for the generator, and it may not last long in a salt water environment. If only used in fresh water I doubt there would be any problems. The overall efficiency wouldn't be as good as a 4 stroke outboard, but would the difference be noticeable? 

The ideal situation would be an electric trolling motor that also worked as a generator when there was plenty of wind, but I don't know if anything like that is available. 

Regards,
Nathan
