Thanks,
Alan.   

I too would not want the built in tanks as I would
worry that they were a rot trap. 

But I wouldn't have a clue where to get plastic cans
shallow enough to fit in that space. If you use
plastic cans lying on their sides then unless the tops
are guaranteed leak proof, the contents are likely to
seep out and make a puddle in the bilge.

Would have thought that metal or concrete ballast
would be better there and your drinking water in
normal cans somewhere else.

You know those flexible plastic bladder things that
you get with wine-in-the-box? Could one of them be
utilised somewhere?
