A guy named Jeff in the UK is doing some work with scalling up Paradox.  If you look at message 416 in this year's messages you can do a return to his email which is partially obscurred and ask him about it.  He posted a set of lines not too long ago that looked pretty nice.  I think there would be a great deal of interest in a proven, scalled up version.  I for one would be very happy to do the prototype or the next one thereafter.  I guess Don would be the most qualified to do the intial build however.

This is a pretty common question.  
The chine runners are a relatively new concept so every new design which uses them is somewhat of an experiment.  The chine runners will probably work on sharpies with a good amount of rocker and a good amount of ballast.  Unfortunately there are not many nautical architects that focus on this innovation.  If you want a larger design, you may have to experiment on a scaled up design similar hull shape.

Here are a few larger sharpie design websites:

I believe the chine runner concept will work on larger boats, but have not seen any examples.
