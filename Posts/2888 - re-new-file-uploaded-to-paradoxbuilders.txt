I would be glad to give them to anybody that is wiling to host them, I plan on doing more, and I "should" get better at it. A person without any technical savy can install Bitcomet get the torrent files and download the movies, it is your option to help serve, but thats not required. as time goes by the amount of data would be far to much for me to hand deliver to each person. To me this makes the best sense to serve them. I doubt you will find a web service provider thats willing for free to serve 3 gigs of movies to the world without money or megaspam, or email address that they can sell. Also its a great way for others to do the same, once you seed the file you do not have to keep hosting them as there will be peer servers holding the files also. Il bet a dollar to a doghnut that members here would love to watch a video of how to, in the building sequence, and take the 5 mins to install bitcomet and get a file of it.
