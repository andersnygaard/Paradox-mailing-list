Subject: Crushed Walnut Shells

When I was a little boy I saw this in my fathers boatyard. The non-skid surface for the decks were coated with a layer of crushed walnut shells. The granulated english walnut shells came in a big cardboard barrel. They were used mostly for sandblasting industrial things like the insides of jet engines. And also for sandblasting auto parts without badley destroying them if they were delicate. 

Today I found them again. At a pet store. They are sold as bedding/sand for pet lizards. I got ten pounds. I'll put up some pictures of my work when I get to this step. Which is soon. 

The general idea is to mask off the deck for the areas to be non-skid. Then apply an even coat of paint. And then, rightaway, as the paint is still wet sprinkle a layer of about a quarter inch deep all over it. Then wait one day. Then use a broom and sweep off all the crushed walnut shells that will come off. Then remove the masking tape. Then give one coat of paint overtop of the whole deck. This coat locks in place the granuals. If the deck is too harsh at this point put on another coat of paint to soften the tooth. 

This is what I remember. However my dad always used oil based enamel for this. I intend to use Acrylic Latex. So, we'll see how it goes.
