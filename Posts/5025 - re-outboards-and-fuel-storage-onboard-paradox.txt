Greg,

My intention is to do exactly that. I will build a couple of vented lockers in each stern quarter with hatches onto the deck.
An early mock up is here

which gives a rough idea of where it will go.

I will have to remove some of the vent baffle, and that would have been a lot easier to do at installation time.

There is still plenty of room for the tiller to swing through it's complete arc.

I will also have the mainsheet run from a the decl level on the port quarter, back down through a fairlead in the deck above the baffle, similar to waht Glen has done to accomodate his self steering.
