See. Little peoples! I'm little peoples too, I just happen to be two little peoples :0)

A Paradox would accommodate longer people by dropping the floor between bulkheads 1 
and 2 to the same level as the main floor. Laying down length isn't a problem but turning 
over without hitting your kettle, handily placed for a night time brew as I'm having now, or 
anything else would be a problem.

A Little Cruiser?

If I have to build another boat I am thinking that it will be a reduced Madrigal with a cabin 
going all the way aft and a lug rig, perhaps with mizzen.
