And what was their answer?

Get Lost ... Come on in ... We don't know nothin' about no knots

A phone call elicited a response so speedy that I wondered if it hadn't been learnt by rote for these occasions. 

Because the reply left me feeling a little uneasy I have sent three photos of the knots to Robbins and invited them to consider their answer after seeing the pics.

I've told them that I am quite happy to epoxy the gaps if that is their considered opinion.
