Subject: Re: Anchoring

What I do on Enigma is to carry my anchor line forward by using a separate loop of line that runs from the bow cleat to the stern. So when I want to anchor I first drop my hook off the stern, pay out my rode and then tie it off on my stern cleat. Then I connect the rode to the loop of line using the snap shackle that's permanently attached to it. Afterwards, it's just a matter of pulling the rode to the bow.  One thing I did to avoid the shackle from slapping into the bow at anchor was to pad it with a neoprene sleeve.
