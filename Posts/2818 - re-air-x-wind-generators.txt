Subject: Re: Air-x wind generators

Southwest Windpower says the Air-X does not use the "aero-elastic" blades, like it did on the older 403. Instead, they use the electric break concept you describe. In their website they say:

"Much Lower Noise: Previous AIR wind modules relied on their aero-elastic blade design for protection in high winds. This caused a loud flutter noise in winds above 35 mph (16 m/s). AIR-Xs circuit monitors the wind speed and electronically slows the blades as it reaches its rated output preventing it from going into flutter. This results in a much quieter wind turbine. In high winds, the AIR-X will continue to produce power at a reduced level until the wind decreases, at which point maximum potential output will resume."

So say the sales department. :) But wind gennies will always be louder than solar, but also cheaper than solar. TANSTAAFL still applies
