Subject: Odyssey's bill of materials

Hi all,

I put together a rough bill of materials that I used to build my boat. It is not 100% complete, besides it is really hard to separate "materials" from "equipment &amp; gear", but, nevertheless I think, it gives a fair estimate of the cost involved broken by different groups of materials.

Bill of materials:					
						
ACX grade plywood 3/4; 1/2; 3/8; 1/4 inch and doorskin ply   $400
Fir straight grain studs 2x4, 2x6, and 2x8 inches   	$55
Teak planks and boards					$200
Foam insulation pannels (2, 1.5 and 1/2 inch) 		$100
						
~7-8 gal of epoxy					$800
60 yards 24, 6, and 4 oz fiberglass cloth, 50 yards 2, 4, and 6 inch fiberglass tape						$350
						
Bronze nails, s/s screws, and bolts			$250
Deck hardware (blocks, cleats, plates, round rail, fittings, rudder pintle&amp;gudgeon, etc.)					$550
Hatch						     $250
Grab rails 						$175
350 lbs of lead	(wheel weigths)				$150

Lexan windows (1/4 inch)				$185
Paint (btm, hull, and topsides)				$150
Misc (copper tubing, PVC plumbing &amp; water pump, pouring foam, 3 qts varnish)						$300

			total (materials and hardware)	$3915
 

Best regards,
Alexander Fadeev
