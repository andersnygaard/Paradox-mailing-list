Gentlemen sailors,

In my opinion, the design reason behind the Paradox is precisely the fact that it needs no motor. Why restrict yourself to such a small boat if you are going to use an engine? I hate the stink, trouble, weight, line tangles, fuel danger and maintenance problems a motor invokes. With electric engines, then it's the weight and maintenance of batteries which is involved, plus the poor performance. The avoidance of a motor is the main reason why I chose the Paradox, I feel that proper training with a well balanced yuloh is a perfect complement to the sail on this boat. I also own a 26 foot Norwalk Island Sharpie, it has an engine, I use it to entertain guests which have to be back at a specific time, that's what motors are for- big boats and schedules.

When I travel with the Paradox, the conversation starter is always “What, no motor? You came all this way without an engine?” Put a motor on it and you are just another normal boat.

As far as security is concerned, my experience says that a motor will always fail you when you need it the most, I prefer to learn to do without.

Just my 2 cents.

Respectfully, I will still like you if you think differently!

André
