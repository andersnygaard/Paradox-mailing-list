Welcome back Glen! How was your trip? There seems to be about 15 or 20 new members join in the past while, so be prepared for some enquiries. 

A couple of questions you might be able to comment on:

1. Upwind performance of the sail.

2. Effectivenss of the chine runners.

I suspect that some people are curious if Paradox will tack within 90 degrees. I know this is somewhat of a subjective observation and several people have commented on it on the Micrcruising group.

Wonder what your impressions are?

So far a great new bunch of new members!

Cheers, Nels
