Good Morning fellow Paradoxers

Enuf and I have had a week apart and found that absence does indeed make the heart grow fonder, but it's back to work tomorrow and launching date gets pushed further away. the way I'm moving Bill will be ready before me!

My new piece of Douglas Fir arrived but I have been thinking about the possibility of cutting out the knotty bit of the boom (which is 1.7m from the roller) and splicing in a new piece of timber rather than making a completely new boom.

I could cut a mortice and tenon joint for each end of the new section, which would be no more than 4" long excluding the jointing faces, and would give loads of gluing area. I could even dowel through the joint faces for extra security.

I have put 3 pics of the knotty bit in the Enuf photo album and I'll leave them there a week or so.

Your thoughts appreciated.

Must go, my son is 21 today and I think I hear him stirring.
