I have been a member of the Paradox and Microcruising groups for a few years now. Here is my take on the FB question: 

About 10 years agho we started a Family based Yahoo Group. We had around 60 members in about a dozen states and it was our way of keeping in touch. We averageed about 200-400 messages a month. 

About a year ago we started a Face Book page for the family. In that short period of time the Yahoo Groups postings are down to less than 20 most months and the Face Book page gets around 20 a day when its busy. 

The Face Book interface is very powerful and much more interactive than the Yahoo groups. If, like me, you just wait on the daily list of activity and review it, Yahoo is probably your cup of tea. If, on the ther hand, you are actively seeking to build, ask questions, and otherwise interact, FB is a much more powerful platform. 

It basically amount to personal preference. As far as Face Book security goes, you are always in full control of who sees what on your site.

Just my two cents worth. I still use them both.
