My son and I cruise the Thames Estuary.

I also cruise the Scottish Isles,  Ireland and selected bits of the South Coast.   Not,  if I can avoid it,  the Solent.   In the Solent the 'steaming cone' is thought to mean 'examiner on board'.

Not yet in a Paradox!

Your philosophy is similar to mine.
Didn't a rowing eight collide with Matt's Enigma (or was it Dave's Paradox?) while he was asleep,  at anchor?
So many questions:  was he flying a ball,  or a light?  was the eight keeping a lookout?   Was he anchored near a channel?   was the eight within the local speed limit?
