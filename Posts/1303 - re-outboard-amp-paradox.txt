Thanks to all who replied.
I see that the new 2.3hp 4 stroke Honda has an integral one litre tank. Any idea how far that will go at say half throttle?
My retirement dream is to tour the waterways of Europe. Any thoughts on operating the outboard from inside, under cover, when it is raining?
Finally, does the rudder clear the outboard fully?
Cheers....Derek
