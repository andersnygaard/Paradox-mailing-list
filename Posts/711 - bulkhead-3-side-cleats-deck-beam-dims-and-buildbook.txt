Subject: Bulkhead 3 side cleats? Deck Beam dims and BuildBook
Date: Sat, 28 Sep 2002 11:28:36 -0000

There do not appear to be any side cleats on bulkhead 3. Is this correct? 3 is the 18mm ply bulkhead with no deck beam (middle of cabin).

Also, the deck beam dimensions are not specified on all the drawings. I am assuming 25x45 is used on all bulkheads with deck beams. I willprobably laminate two pieces of 12mm ply to make a deck beam. Does anyone know the radius of the deck? Dimensions are shown for the deck curve, but it would be easier and more accurate to pull a radius and draw the arc.

I added a BuildBook folder in the file section, to post buildingnotes. I am still in the planning stage, haven't made any sawdust yet.
