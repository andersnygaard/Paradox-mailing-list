Subject: Re: What would you change on 2nd build?

Hello,

I was wondering if you would change the size of the hatch. At present, it is approximately 870, which is about half the total cabin length i.e. 705. Do you have any thoughts on this?

In terms of progress with my Paradox build, I am cutting the cabin deck tomorrow!

Kind regards,
