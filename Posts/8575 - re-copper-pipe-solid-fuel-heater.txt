The fun factor is much of my own interest in this heater but it would be great to not need any extra heat at all.

Not to get off topic but my own boat is not a Paradox but a copy of Andre-Francois's Gorfnik puddle duck. He did state that the two 8" air boxes on the sides insulates it pretty good and body heat is enough for him. My own copy of his boat is not finished yet but doesn't seem as warm inside (on cold days) as I might like. I haven't had a chance to try it enough to tell for sure yet.

I knew the Paradox used foam on the sides but didn't remember it also has foam everywhere except the windows and the floor. The floor on a real Paradox is not in direct contact with the water so that alone should insulate it. Add a foam pad for comfort and I can see where Paradox (as designed) probably doesn't need extra heat.

Matt really fit a lot of details into a small boat. I have no doubt the real Paradox would be my perfect microcruiser but all those complex looking details have kept me from starting that build yet. Even if I never build the real Paradox boat, I'm sure many of the features of that design will be included in my next build.
