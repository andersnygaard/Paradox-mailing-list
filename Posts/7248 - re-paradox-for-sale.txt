Thanks Joe

I'm in the USA. Upper left hand corner. Washinton State. 1 hour west of Seattle. Port Orchard.

I'm in complete remission from cancer for the present. The Chemo therapy killed the nerves in my feet and hands somewhat. My journey moves on now. Not sails on.

I have an illness (cancer) which forces me to sell my paradox "Ironside". $3000. with trailer.
