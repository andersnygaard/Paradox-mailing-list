Hi James,

Perhaps we had better take this conversation off list as it's more to do with flying than sailing...;-)

By the way, I hope to go and see a Paradox in the flesh tomorrow afternoon. I wonder how it will seem after looking at the pics and descriptions on the web.

My wife describes it as a pointy coffin.
