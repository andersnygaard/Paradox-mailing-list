Price ?

I can vouch for the quality of this boat and her seaworthiness, having been a good friend of Geoff's for quite a few years now.  He was nice enough to give me a look through Small Fry when I was still contemplating my build.  And I have been for a short sail in her too.  She is definitely set up to be very secure and has completed some very extensive trips.  It will be good to see this beautiful boat going to another adventurous sailor.
