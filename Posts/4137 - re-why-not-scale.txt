Subject: Re: Why not scale?

I am not a professional builder, but I cannot see any reason not to scale up the paradox.  There is a document floating around the net about enlarging the paradox.  Supposedly, MattL has given his blessing for a .20 larger version.  Going any bigger, you would need to review the scantlings, and bigger probably add some additional bulkheads.  

If you buy the paradox plans from Dave, there are sketches of a 21 and 23 foot paradox that I presume MattL had drawn.

Lastly, I was banned by don elliott from the paradoxboatbuilders for discussing building a larger paradox.  I would suggest you not talk about any modifications or discuss the fact that there are two paradox groups.  donny gets his pants wet if you do.
Childish, I know. But I'm not holding the key to the sandbox. 

Good luck if you build a bigger paradox, I'd love to see it.
