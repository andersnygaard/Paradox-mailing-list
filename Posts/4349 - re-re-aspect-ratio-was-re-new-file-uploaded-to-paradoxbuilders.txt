Alan,

I do appreciate the junk rig, but I've had more sloops by far.  I am getting some help from another person on the list who is going to let me see his Paradox before I get started on mine.  It is possible that once I get it straight in my mind how the standard rig performs, I'll stay with it.  My experience with my junk rigged Potter has kept my fondness for the Chinese rig intact.  I understand it and know how to tweak it to do what I need to do.  Familiarity has some bonuses.  I am looking at different types of boomkins for the Paradox junk rig, but don't have a satisfactory solution yet.  My original thinking was to attach it to the rudder, which has been done on other boat.  The problem with anything attached to the transom is that it will interfere with the yuloh.
