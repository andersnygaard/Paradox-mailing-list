No longer a Paradox owner, I have never lost my enthusiasm for the boat, now owned by Jim. 'Faith' was the only boat I regretted selling, but she is in good hands.

I have what may be the next best thing to a Paradox, a 'C'Type West Whight Potter for micro-cruising.

I'm currently in my 7th day of a cruise, and I invite you to follow my daily log at: http://bills-log.blogspot.com

If any Paradox owners want to make contact as I continue my cruise I shall be delighted, especially if I get the chance of checking out their boats.

Cheers,
Bill.
