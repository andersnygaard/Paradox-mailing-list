Yes Phil, I had good luck with fitting and installing the ply in handy
sized pieces. I may not have been able to use the ply as efficiently as one
can with a pre-drawn layout of cuts. I took measurement off the frame to
rough cut an eight foot long rectangular panel of the width needed to cover
the next space. Clamping that piece in place I could mark the inside of the
panel for trimming the panel and showing all bullkhead and stringer
locations. That showed me where to leave the wood bare where the joints
would be glued and I could epoxy the other areas while the panel was on the
bench. I scarfed the joints as I went.
