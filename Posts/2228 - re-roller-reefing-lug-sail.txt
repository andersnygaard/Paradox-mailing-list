Subject: Re: roller reefing lug sail?

Hi Jason,

I'm so delinquent on answering e-mail that I'm not sure if your question was answered so here goes. Yes the sail rig on Paradox is adaptable to other boats but I would caution that unless you have put the center of effort in the same place that the designer did, you will have problems with balance. I'm going to make the assumption that you did the necessary math to get that correct.

The roller furling on the Paradox, while looking somewhat complicated, is about as simple a solution as I have come across. It is basically a drum on the end of the boom which is turned via a furling line led below deck. the boom rotates on a bronze shaft which rides in a bronze/copper pipe inside the end of the boom. Because the rolled up sail and yard must be set aside when not in use to allow access to the hatch the tack fitting is attached through a pipe and allowed to swivel into position either up or down. I hesitate to photo copy the relevant drawings and make them available to you because this is a unique system and Matt deserves full credit for it's development. The purchase price of a set of plans is so low that they would be well worth the cost just for the rigging details alone. Contact Dave &amp; Mindy Bolduc at: mbolduc@triad.rr.com for plans cost. You can also check the photos section for some pictures of Zoe sailing that will have some detail on the furling gear. Hope this helps.

Tailwinds,
Glen
