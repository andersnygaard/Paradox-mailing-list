Hi,

I'm wanting to put the water tanks in the boat I bought, everything was built to print except the tops. In Don's articles, he says, West did not recommend using their epoxy for the water tanks, but Systems Three did. I don't know what the builder used to coat them with. What's the difference? Any ideas on the subject?

Thanks,

David Beard
