Subject: Re: CHINE RUNNERS ON A SUPER PELICAN

In a chine runner boat the sides of the boat provide lateral resistance, the chine runners keep the flow of water in place along the side of the boat. The sides have to be very near vertical, the boat has too be somewhat narrow for its length, and it has to be immersed deep enough so that the immersed area matches what would be needed from the centerboard. The rudder would normally be loaded, meaning it would be larger, as the immersed sides do not quite come up to the same area as the centerboard. This moves back the center of lateral resistance, which means the sail would have to be moved back as well. 

So you would have to add considerable ballast, enlarge the rudder, and shift the mast to the rear. You could tack on a chine runner as mentioned, but unless you engineer everything else, I don't think it would work too well, but you could just try tacking it on to experiment with. The leeboard idea may be the easiest.
 
HI ALL  (AGAIN) - 
 
LET ME START AT THE BEGINNING.... I AM WORKING ON THE REDESIGN OF THE SAN FRANCISCO PELICAN - THE 18' SUPER PELICAN MODEL.   I'VE GOT EVERYTHING IN PLACE (AT LEAST I BELIEVE THERE IN PLACE).           
NOW HERE'S  MY PROPLEM.   I WANT TO ADD "CHINE-RUNNERS AND GET RID OF THAT TREMENDOUS CENTERBOOARD.  ICAN DRAW IT UP OK BUT I NEED SOME INPUT FROM "PARADOX" BUILDER AS TO ITS PHASABILATIES.  NOW THAT YOU'VE BUILT YOUR BOATS DO YOU THINK THE CHINE-RUNNERS CAN BE TRANSFERED TO ANOTHER DESIGN.  IF I LAY THE PELICAN DRAWING OVER THE PARADOX DRAWING THEY JUST ABOUT MATCH (CHINES).
I WOULD APPRECIATE ANY INPUT (GOOD OR BAD) ABOUT WHAT I'M TRYING.
 
THANKS ALL - ALOHA - JACK SPOERING- ocala, fl
