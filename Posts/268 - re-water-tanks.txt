Mameco International make a line of Vulkem Urethane products which I have used over the years to line wood flower boxes and Koi tanks. It is allegedly non toxic after it cures (the fish don't seem to mind) and totally waterproof. A plywood fish tank I built 8 years ago still looks like new. Vulkem makes several products,This is the onesI used.were Nos. 626 and 636. 640/642 May work as well. Check the MSDA data sheets first. They should tell about toxicity. I clean the tanks with Simple Green cleaner before the fish go in and rinse well.
