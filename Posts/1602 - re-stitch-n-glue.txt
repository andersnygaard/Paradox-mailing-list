In all seriousness,

IF one was to go the S&G route, when it comes to the deck, and cabin area, the study plans show the default cabin, i would like to stretch the top a bit forward, leaving the rear the way it is for entering the boat from the water, now also to make it more "open water capable" what can be done to upgrade the windows, and or what would be a good reason for not adding any to the front, ie wind, too much boyancy etc etc. most likely to just past the mast.
