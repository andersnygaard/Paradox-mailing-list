Hi,

I'm considering Matt's new sailplan, which makes it higher abaft, thus leaving a top triangle. Do you think increasing the aft circumference of the boom would solve this issue or create new ones such as wrinkled sail or sliding sail on the boom?

Are there any sailmakers out there who might have some ideas?

Best regards,

Kjell Karlsson
