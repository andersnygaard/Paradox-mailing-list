Hi All,

I'm using west systems Epoxy (Fast Hardener). the hardener I bought about a year ago has turned a reddish color. What's going on? It seems to harden ok. Has any one else had this happen?

Update on Refit: The bottom is on, along with the first coat of Bottom Paint. (I used Glens method) A word of advise if you're thinking of using anti-freeze to treat your plywood, It took almost a month to dry out. Should be in the water in about 2 wks. Will Post pictures then.

Glen, Do you still want to do the weekend trip?
