Subject: Trunk Cabin vs Raised Deck Cabin

Hello,

Does anyone know if there is a particular reason why Paradox is designed with a trunk cabin vs a raised deck cabin? It seems to me that a raised deck cabin would give more interior space and more top-side buoyancy in the event of a knockdown. I think the raised deck might also be easier and stronger to build than a trunk cabin. A trunk cabin does give lower side decks for going forward, but I understand that going forward is seldom needed on Paradox.

Thanks,
John
