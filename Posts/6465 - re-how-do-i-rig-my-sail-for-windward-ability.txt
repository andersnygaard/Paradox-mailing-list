Subject: Re: How do I rig my sail for windward ability

After reading over the other replies I have not very much to add. I agree with them too. However I have good windward progress when I sheet in the boom to be over the corner of the transom. Do not sheet it in closer than that. If anything sheet a little more out from the corner of the transome, just a little bit. I like to see all the cloth "standing still" and working. Good luck
