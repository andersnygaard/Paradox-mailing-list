Hi John,

The autohelm worked or does work fine but it consumes electricity faster 
then I can replace it. Thats ok,  for a short cruise of a few days, but 
not so good for longer times away. The gear is almost repaired (waiting 
for epoxy to dry) and once done I'll post some pictures. I finished 
installing a couple of bows to the  front of the mount yesterday and 
that will take care of the sheet fouling. I've really enjoyed the 
building of the vane. It is almost all made from plumbing supplies so 
the cost has been quite low.

Hello Glen,
I thought I saw a photo of a 'tillermaster' mounted on one side oz Zoe 
attached to the steering line. How did that work out??
I am looking forward to seeing sketches and detailed photo's of your 
vane gear as well.
