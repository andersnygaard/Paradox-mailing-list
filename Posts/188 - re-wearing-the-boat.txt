I'm probably one of those who mentioned Paradox is too small for a big guy.  I did the same mock up using cardboard and such and came to the conclusion that at 6'2", 240# I'm too big, too old, and too stiff to try  and maneuver around in Paradox.  I love the boat but sitting straight legged and belly crawling forward (when needed) would be very difficult for me.  My minimum size is 48" of sitting headroom and 72" beam, still acheivable in a small Paradox like boat.
