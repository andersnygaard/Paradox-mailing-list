Subject: Re: Making mods after Bosunator Challenge

Hey Andy,

The only downside I see to exiting at the top of the transom is that the line may still chafe against the edge of the deck/transom joint when running downwind. However, this could easily be solved with some sort of rub strake or something. I started down that road but was having a hard time making a strake that conformed to the deck curve while at the same time conforming to the radius of the deck/transom union. That's when the idea of using the fairleads popped into my head. It's not ideal, but it seems to be working pretty well.

I plan on making some mods to the sail this winter, and the window will definitely be incorporated. It will be interesting to see the mods you do as well.

Regards,
