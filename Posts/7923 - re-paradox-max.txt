Gunter,

Your progress is an inspiration for us all. I imagine all the changes in your personal life that you've been through. Not easy, but keep it up !

I received plans last week and was checking dimensions with your side layout in the photos album. Most of them don't match de 20% scale factor. Could you please give me a word on that ?

Thank you in advance.
