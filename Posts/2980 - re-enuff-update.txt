Hi Nels

The pigment is mixed with the final coat of epoxy and laid on with a 8" spatula and dragged out it can be worked into a smooth shiny or matt surface. I can get a textured deck by sprinkling on sugar and washing down with hot water 24 hours later. Less painful on the feet than sand I'm told.

I haven't checked the times thoroughly but nail hard takes about 4 hours. I will do in either two or three parts: deck then sides or deck then port side starboard side. If there is a shade difference between the deck and sides it won't be important and if from head on all three are slightly different I'll blame the light! :0)

Cheers   .........    Derek
