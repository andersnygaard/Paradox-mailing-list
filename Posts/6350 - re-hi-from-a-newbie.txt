Hi Al,

Thanks for that, and for the invitation to have a squint at "Little Jim", I wont come and bother you though unless I decided to pursue things further, I really shouldn't get myself side tracked from the Silhouette, but have a spare junk sail and a carbon mast the right size for a Paradox, I may well decide to have a go at building one after I have finished  the Silhouette. I am surprised that more Paradox haven't been built with the junk rig, as it seems to me to be an eminently suitable combination. Charlie.

I suspect that it is a case of "if it ain't broke don't fix it".

I am a fan of junk rigs, but I think that what you would lose when removing the designed rig would not be matched by any advantages of the junk.  

Hoping for calm nights

Al,
