Subject: 2 questions!

Question 1

how far from the top of the mast does the halyard sheave fit.
I can't see any measurements on the drawings?

Question 2
How does one go about bending 12mm bronze rod for the tack strop? That's seriously tough stuff. I've been informed to anneal it by heating till cherry red then quench in water. Anyone been able to cold bend it?

Thanks
Pete
