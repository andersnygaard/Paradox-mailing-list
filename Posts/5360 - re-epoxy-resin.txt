Subject: Re: epoxy resin

I haven't heard anything bad about MAS so if it works for the beams it should work with anything else, especially if it is readily available, and you are familiar with it.

I know one guy in San Fran who gets all his epoxy off e bay and swears by it price wise as he builds a lot of boats.

System Three is also great.
