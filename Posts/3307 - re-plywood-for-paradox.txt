Knowing that others have used and had good luck with exterior ply makes my decision alot easier. 
Thank You,

Wayne,
I used AC exterior ply for my Paradox, same as Matt and Glen. It will take a little more epoxy to achieve a good finish if you use AC exterior ply. I use Systems three epoxy just because I'm comfortable with it.
You might want to order the building manual from Don, its very helpful.
If you have any questions please do not hesitate to ask.
Happy Building
David Beard
