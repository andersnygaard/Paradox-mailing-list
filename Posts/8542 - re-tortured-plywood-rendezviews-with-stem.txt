Al, 

That is a neat trick.  I'll be sheathing the boat, most likely
fiberglass.  I now know to go a little thicker in that area.

I went thicker but there was still considerable wear, which is why I 
fitted the sacrificial pad. Jim's solution also works.

Of course you may not spend as much time running aground as I do ....
