Congratulations! She sure is a beautiful example of our craft of choice. I am very interested in hearing your thoughts on how she performs while you are learning to sail, and as you grow into her. I have been sailing in various boats on and off for years, but have no experience with a design like this, or a lug rig. I am very interested in various perspectives as I prepare to begin my build.

Enjoy,

Stuart
