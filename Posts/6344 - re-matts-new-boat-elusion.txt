Dave, 

I appreciate the pictures.
Note the little end plate on the rudder cheek plate.  It can only be on the port side since the swing up rudder is on the other side. 
Interesting little feature.  I thought is was just the light but I enlarged the picture and am fairly sure it is a plate.

Matt has posted pictures of his latest creation, a 9' x 38" cruiser for the Ultimate Florida Challenge.

The new boat looks alot like a Paradox/Enigma 460 with long chine runners,a wide stern and long rudder blade. My guess it will have excellent directional stability. The boat is being tested with Sand Fleas' sail, but I think Matt said he is making a new sail which will use a roller furling drum. I guess it will also use a spray skirt instead of a hatch. All in all, another very pretty design.

Dave
