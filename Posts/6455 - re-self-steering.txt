Observing Bill's Faith, with his burgee on a small flagstaff at the bow, I imagined a small mast (half a metre high?) supporting a rigid vane (perhaps cut like a small jib). this could act as a windvane for a self steering gear and could be backed when tacking to help the bow fall off.

Hoping for calm nights
