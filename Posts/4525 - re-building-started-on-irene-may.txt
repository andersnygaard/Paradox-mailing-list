Wonderful news Ian. I know what you mean about space. I've been tripping over myself all week trying to shape my Chine and sheer strakes which take up the full length of my building space.
The 2 side panels are layed out flat and I need to rearrange everything so that I can stack things up in a shipshape fashion so that I can actually move. Every time I start clearing up and taking things outside it starts raining, so I'll be glad when it stops so that I can work outside again in the sunshine. 
Good luck with the build. Perhaps you could stall the china cabinet until the winter. I'm sure the weather is unsuitable for that type of joinery at the moment :-)
