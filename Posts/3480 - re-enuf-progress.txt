Why brass Derek?

When I built my first banger boat, 30 odd years ago,I used ordinary mild steel for all the metal deck fittings. Coated with Galvafroid cold galvanising paint and then given a lick of normal gloss because the galv paint is very soft. Turned out completely satisfactory.

Mild steel is stronger, cheaper, easily welded and easily sourced. If you are much more fussy than me, then you can get it galvanised.
