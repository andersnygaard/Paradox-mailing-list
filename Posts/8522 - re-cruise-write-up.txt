Hi Jim,

The sheer clamps are now in place. I'm wondering whether it will be possible to pull the chine logs into place without breaking them when I come to do them. Any thoughts about how to go about it other than ripping them in half?

There is another Paradox in Auckland which I have seen. Its owner posts here occasionally. I built my Michalak Philsboat after researching for boats on the Internet and had a great time in her. As far as I know, she's the only Michalak design built in NZ apart from my nephew who built a Polepunt.

I'm certain my decision to build a Paradox is a good one. As soon as I dry fitted her, her shape told me she's going to be a sweet mover. When my 21 old son saw her in 3D he said "This looks like a real boat this time, Dad!"

Cheers,

Rob.
