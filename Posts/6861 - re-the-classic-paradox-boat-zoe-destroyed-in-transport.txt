I too am stunned. That is a sad loss for both you, Glen and the whole Paradox community. Zoe was inspirational in my build and choice of boat. Glen's article on his shakedown cruise was what probably sold me on the design. I took that leap of faith and am not disappointed. A sad loss but rest assured, her spirit lives on in others boats.
