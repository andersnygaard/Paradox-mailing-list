Subject: Re: epoxy question

Felix,
I have been using the slow version of their epoxy for everything I have done and it is just fine.  I am hooked on the slow.  I hate having a cup kick off while I am using it.  No complaints.  I have not ordered fiberglass from them.  I used dynel fabric I got from someplace else (Jamestown) and I find it much more pleasant to work with.  I have bought their fiberglass tape now that I think of it and it works just fine.  The dynel drapes around corners much more satisfactorily than fiberglass cloth.  The fiberglass will not crease sharply and pulls away if the corners are not rounded.

Quick order response, in general a satisfactory company for epoxy and odds and ends.
