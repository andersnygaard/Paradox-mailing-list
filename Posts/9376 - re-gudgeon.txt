Hello,

Welcome to the forum and thank you for posting your question.

In addition to choosing the type of FG for epoxy work, it is also important to note that the gassing of the epoxy as it cures to quickly can trap air bubbles, which can reduce the overall strength of the fabricated part.

One method I have used has been to pour small amount of epoxy in a form and let it go through go through its high peak of heat dissipation, then add another patch. Repeat process adding more small quantities of epoxy. The idea is to control the heat build up.

I can not provide details of measurements because after many hours and years working with epoxy and I have become way more intimate with the stuff than one should need to be.

I think somewhere here on the forum in a post or online someone had made the part from epoxy and detailed their work.. May need to keep researching through the web.

Keep on keeping on,, let us know how you do with your part.
