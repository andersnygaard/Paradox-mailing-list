Hi Rob

I'd be more concerned about the effects of chafe on the furling line, where it goes through the deck and has to cope with different directions of pull, than the halyard. I think that a short piece of annealed copper pipe with the outer end well belled out and epoxied into the deck would do nicely for the furling line. Best to fix the tube as low in the deck as you can, so there is nothing protruding above deck level.
For the halyard, if you get the deck hole in the right place there is hardly any side pressure on the line, so little tendency to chafe...

After hard use since 2008, there is no noticeable wear in my lower rudder gudgeon, which is made from epoxy with no metal lining..

Interesting that you're installing the water ballast tanks.....I think that of the Paradoxes here in the UK, only one - Alastair's - is using water ballast. The rest use that space for dry stowage.

Enjoy your summer Rob. Here in UK we've had nearly all gales and rain, but spring is just around the corner..

Best
Jim
