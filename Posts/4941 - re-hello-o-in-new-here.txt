Hi Al and Bill,

Just thinking-out-loud really.As always,'improvements'
are hardly ever that.
What about just the rear-deck entry, leaving the sheet
on the clew-end of the boom? Not enough difference to clear
an outboard? Introduce some other problems?

This is one idea that I gave considerable thought to after I noticed that Little Cruiser has a deck-entry sheet, but I eventually decided I didn't know enough about what the downward pull of the sheet does to the set of the sail. That, and the weight of the boom are all that hold the sail down, there not being a kicking strap.

To solve the problem of the sheet-fouled motor the end of the boom needs to be further inboard, or the sheet not be attached to the end of the boom. Some boats with roller reefing on the boom have a sort of claw arrangement which runs loosely on the boom and anchors the sheet. This may work, but would need your longitudinal wire to locate it at the right position along the boom.

As I say, I gave this (and lots of other 'improvements') much thought when in the early stages of build but eventually decided I didn't know enough to make a sensible decision so would build as designed, and add my improvements later. I have since found that as I find no need for a motor (I was sure I would need one when I started building) the main sheet fouling becomes a non-problem. (My other 'improvements' would all have been disasters as well).

Hoping for calm nights
