My observation is that you have to keep the speed up. In choppy water 
way is lost as you come up to the wind and the boat stops.

In a river, or other constricted water, if there isn't enough room to 
get up speed between tacks then eventually the way will be lost.

In calm water, even with very light winds, I have never had trouble 
tacking.
