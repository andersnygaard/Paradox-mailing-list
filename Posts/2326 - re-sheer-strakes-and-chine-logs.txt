Subject: Re: Sheer strakes and Chine logs

Thanks Nels.
Can I take it then that the chine logs and sheers are just for the fasteners? 

From what I understand the chine logs and sheers also contribute to the strength and stiffness of the structure. Therefore I consider them as being more than something to hold the fasteners. A well built "Box Boat" with some curvature in the chines and sheer clamps, really contributes to support stiffness in the plywood topsides, bottom and decks. Then if you glass the exterior you have in effact an incredilby strong box beam. The other alternative is to use epoxy fillets and glass tape.

If you compare the difference in cost between good quality wood and cheaper and amortize it over 15 years, it is a poor place to cut costs in my opinion. You will never regret good quality materials once the boat is completed!

Cheers, Nels
