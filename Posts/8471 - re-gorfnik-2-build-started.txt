Tom,

Thanks for the offer but I'm in Pennsylvania so not much chance of me making it across the country to see your boat in person. I do keep checking on your blog and youtube videos to see the build process.

I think I got all my pictures moved out of the original Gorfnik album now. I didn't replace all of them in the new Gorfnik#2 album since many were wrong. I'm still working on updating the plans with the new information and pictures Andre-Francois posted.

The more I see of his boat the more I am convinced it will be perfect for my uses.
