Hull is upside down. We slid it out of the garage off its 4 by 4's onto round fence poles. Flipped onto its side, using two 8' long 4 by 2 timbers, onto scrap ply and then flipped again onto its deck. Rolled back into the garage and up onto the 4 by 4's. There were four of us, all hefty, but we could have done it with three. If the bottom is finished by early next week, and it should be, I'll test my theory because only three of us are available to flip it back over.

Finish again! I am going to paint the very bottom red. The reasoning is: I have International Paints red from Caleb, scratches and scores in the bottom will show through red, if I end up inverted red is easy for the rescue helicopter to spot. Sides and deck in green applied as a pigment in my final finsh coat. I have got paint, as I mentioned in an earlier post, but the guy at UK Epoxies recommended the pigment. Can anybody spot any flaws with this?

Cheers all ......  Derek
