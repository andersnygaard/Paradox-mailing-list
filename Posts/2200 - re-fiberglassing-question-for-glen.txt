Hi Dave,

Sorry to have taken so long to get back to you, please forgive me and thank you for the kind words. The cloth I used was 7 oz "E" glass which was cheaper than the 6 oz. In the area of the chine runners I overlapped the roving four times. My fairing technique is to use lots of micro balloons and just pour it on and smooth it out with a 12 inch drywall knife whose handle is almost touching the surface. It takes a little practice but by the time you get the bottom done you should be proficient enough to do the rest of the boat pretty quickly. I also turned the boat such that each side, top and bottom were up to let gravity help out in the flowing process. You can save an enormous amount of time during this phase by always applying the next coat of epoxy with in 24 hours so that you don't have to sand between coats.

Tailwinds,

Glen
