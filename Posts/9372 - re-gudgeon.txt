Epoxy has a chemical reaction that gives off heat as it cures
It will set slower if it’s in a tray , flat open and a thin layer  , and much quicker in a bulk amount , much , it can heat the container it's in to melting point with plastic and hot enough to burn your bare hand in a metal tin . It may be it just got too hot?
