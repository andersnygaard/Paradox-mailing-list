I'm at Ramsgate. Today, Sunday 4th the wind could get up to a 5 or 6 which is too strong. Tomorrow the forecast is for 2 or 3 which is more like it for going to Dover. On the other hand it will be from the SW, exactly a header. I doubt I shall reach Chichester Harbour by towards the end of the week, but if I have the right winds I could get there in 4 to 5 days. Keep an eye on my blog to monitor my progress or lack of it.
Have a great time.
Cheers,
Bill.
