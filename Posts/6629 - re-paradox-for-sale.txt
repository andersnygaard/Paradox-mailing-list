Hi Glen,

Sent this post like a few min. after your post the other day but for some reason it did not make it to the board so I am resending.

Wow!! I am excited for you (your future trip.) and for the lucky person who purchases this boat. She is a work of art, you and your adventures in her became the driving force in my choice to build a paradox clone. I hope you will keep the very informative website up as it has been very helpful to new builders. Congradulations on your future!!

By the way .... you are asking half what the boat is worth in my opinion, she is a work of art.

Rod

Hello everyone, it's been a while since I posted as I have been very busy with my life and am moving forward by downsizing in order to prepare for a circumnavigation in the near future. My partner, who thoroughly enjoys sailing Zoe, thinks her Tanton 43 would be better suited to the task. So... it is with a heavy heart that I have decided to part with her (Zoe that is). I have set the price at $6000 and feel she is worth that to me. Interested parties please contact me off post or call pretty much any time at 386-658-3719.
