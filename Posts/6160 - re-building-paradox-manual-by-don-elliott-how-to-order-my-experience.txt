Hi Paul, 

The email address you used worked fine for me every time. I suggest just retyping and resending; maybe there was a glitch somewhere. Here's a slightly edited cut-and-paste of the last message I received from Wanda (below). Let me know how you go (by direct email to my hotmail account if you like), as I'd like to keep the "how-to" file up-to-date. 

Ciao, 

Stephen

Hello Stephen, I've received your paypal payment. I will be sending the PDF in 2 separate installments as it is to large to send all at once. Thank you for your order and enjoy! 

Sincerely, Wanda
