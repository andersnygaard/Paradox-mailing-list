Hi Pete,

If I were you I would be VERY proud! But because I am not you I can only try to imagine how you feel. Thank you for sharing all your experiences - please let us have some videos of her (and you) sailing.

Good stuff - might consider building Paradox after all (have the plans, but have other plans also...).

Adrian


I've uploaded a little video of progress on Johanna as of today.
Getting ready for a launch very soon.

Enjoy.
