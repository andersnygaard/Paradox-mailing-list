Spent some time last night studying the plans.

The appears to be a longitudinal member in the forward stateroom about a foot hight.  The opening between the top of that member and the deck is also about a foot.

With the size of the opening for access into the forward room, how in the world do you pick up a 65 pound battery and stick it in the location specified in the plans?

Could access hold be cut in the port side of the bulkhead beside the mast plenum box?

Thanks,

Pete
