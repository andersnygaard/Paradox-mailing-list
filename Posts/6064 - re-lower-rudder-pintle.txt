Subject: Re: Lower rudder pintle
 
On Sunday I noticed that my lower rudder pintle has some play, several degrees in any direction. I took everything off. The rudder head has been sitting in a warm, dry room fro three days now, and there is still some moisture around the pintle. I think that means water has seeped into the plywood and is slowly coming out now.
 
How do I fix this? And does anyone have any idea why it happened in the first place? It is not at all a problem I expected.
 
I'll take a picture as soon as I have recharged the batteries for my camera.
 
Regards

I had a related problem in that my pintle came loose in the rudder as the bond with the epoxy failed. The water got down the side of the pintle, but didn't penetrate the wood as I had drilled the hole oversize and then lined it with epoxy.
 
I made a few saw cuts into the the pintle and roughened up the surface before regluing. I will make this part of my regular winter inspection in future.
 
I suspect the lower pintle takes a lot of load, especially when grounding. A side push puts load on the joints between the plywood laminates. If they haven't been well made in the factory they may separate. Possibly a few flush copper rivets through the stock would help.
