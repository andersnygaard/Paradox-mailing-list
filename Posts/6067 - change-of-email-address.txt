Subject: Change of email address

Unfortunately, due to a cock-up with my service provider, my current email address (openboat@as5jg.freeuk.com) is no longer valid.

My new address is openboat@as6jg.freeuk.com. Please use this for all future communications. 

Thanks,
Hoping for calm nights

Al,
Yeovil, England.
