Subject: Re: Small Fry rounds Cape Leeuwin

Hello everyone,

It's official, Small Fry rounded Cape Leeuwin on the 22nd Feb this year. She sailed on to the south east of Cape Leeuwin to anchor at Seal Island. I've posted some new photos of the event under Small Fry.

Pretty awesome those pics from the cockpit in the big water ... very beautiful area too. Thanx for sharing
