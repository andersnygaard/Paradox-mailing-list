Hi Al,

I don't have the insulation fitted in Zoe and thus far it hasn't been a problem. There is a lip which surrounds the cabin and any condensation from the windows does collect there. In my case, there was no water in the gutter, only on the windows and overhead. I have had this problem on other boats as well and found that if you leave some flow-through ventilation, the moisture in the air will be carried out. The trade-off of course is a cold cabin.

Tailwinds,  
Glen
