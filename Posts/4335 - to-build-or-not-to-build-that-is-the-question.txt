Subject: To build or not to build? - that is the question.

Hi you folk out there asking the important question - Should I build or should I not build a Paradox?

If you decide to build, be prepared for a boat that is not instant - she will take about 1 and 1/2 years of your spare time.

The cost to build in the UK will be in the region of around =A32500 - =A34000+ according to the quality of materials and to that you'll need to add the cost of a trailer, second-hand from =A3400 - =A31000; new =A31200 - =A32000+ depending on the type of trailer - break-back or rigid.

To my way of thinking Paradox is as challenging to build as you like to make her, according to the degree of finish you desire.

I'm building 'Faith' with a minimum of power tools; they consist of: 2 electric drills (1 battery type), 1 jigsaw, and 1 power grinder which I've only used for shaping the beams.  I have no other mechanical tools except a vacuum cleaner, which is indispensible.

If all this is too much for you why not consider buying a second-hand boat?  It won't give you the satisfaction gained by building your own Paradox, but it will be value for money if you choose wisely.

There is this moment an Achilles 24 for sale on http://www.ebay.co.uk with a starting bid of =A3300, which includes a road trailer, and an outboard motor!!  I know, because I put the advert there for a friend.  Place this # in the search box for details: 160106120319

Please guys, forgive me for using this post to plug a boat for sale.

Cheers,
Bill.
