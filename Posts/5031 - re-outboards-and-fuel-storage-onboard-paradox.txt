This is a great product, but that mill only puts out the 400W of power in 28 mph winds or higher.  It 9mph winds, it would probably only get 50-70W.  Still a great device, and not taking anything from your observations!

On the same note, some time ago I read an article, about an electric cat if not mistaken.  They had electric power, and planned to rely on their large bank of batteries.  They also installed a reasonable number of panels, to be an "adjunct" the the shore charging.  In real use, they found they could do 6 knots off just the panels in good sun continuously (as long as they had sun).   Now I wish I would have bookmarked that site!

I think were going to see much more powerful panels in the next few years hit the consumer market.  In the near future, electric powered motors are going to become more accepted, more functional, and popular (in my humble and completely uninformed opinion!).
