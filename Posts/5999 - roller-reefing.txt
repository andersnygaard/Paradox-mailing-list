OK Bill just for you. HA HA. I put up 7 photos of my roller reefing version. It's on the upper row first page of the photos section. It is titeled "A Version of the Roll Reefing Tack Strop". I put a groove in the inner end of the axel rod and has a brass screw poking in the the groove. Just like the plans say.
