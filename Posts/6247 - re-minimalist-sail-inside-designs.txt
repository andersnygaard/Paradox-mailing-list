One problem I see with all these light-weight sail-inside designs is how to sail them flat.  On a lark, I rigged my 20', very-stable boat so I could steer it from the cabin and tried it briefly last summer in fairly modest winds.  I got so nervous being unable to use my weight as dynamic balance on the windward side, that I quickly gave up the idea.  I noticed a drawing or two of Illusion that seemed to have adjustable ballast on the sides.  Regarding sailing to weather in a chop, I wonder how the similarly box-like PDRs manage?
