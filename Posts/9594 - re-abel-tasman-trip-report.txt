Hi Alastair,

This is just one of the many trade-offs when Paradoxing, I guess. The boat is very short, so it is going to pitch and roll even in quite small chop as can be seen in the video (I had no idea about these things when I began the build). It does it at anchor too, which is why I always try to seek out the most sheltered nook I can find.

When I had morning tea on my friend's 32 ft keeler in that same anchorage, I thought the wind had dropped, but no, it was just the same when I came back up on deck!

Cheers, 

Rob.
