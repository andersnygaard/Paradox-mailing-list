Subject: Re: Gorfnik #2 build started

Thanks André-François,


Out of all my options, your little Gorfnik seems like my best option.  Paradox is bigger and much more involved plus way more expensive to build although I still hope to one day build one.  The Ocean Explorer didn't have the sail inside option I was looking for.

The only other possibility I have looked at but not bought the plans for is Robbsboat http://duckworksbbs.com/plans/jim/robbsboat/index.htm

I have been following Tom Sorensen's blog http://tomsrobbsboat.blogspot.com/ as he builds the Robbsboat.  Bigger than what I am looking for right now but looks like a nice boat.

I will start a new album to put my pictures in as soon as I have time.  Got other plans today.  Your latest pictures did clear up a lot of questions I had especially the interior pictures.  I wasn't sure where the permanent backrest attached and exactly how the seat/backrest worked.

Post as many pictures as you want of this boat.  I might be the first one to start to copy your design but I know there are others considering it.  I think, once the plans are done and they get out on the internet and not just a couple groups, your little ParaDuck design will have lots of copies made.  At least that's my plan.  To make this design as well know as Paradox, Ocean Explorer, or Scamp.
