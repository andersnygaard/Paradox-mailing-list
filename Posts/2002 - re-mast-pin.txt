The mast foot sits on a block fastened to the bottom of the boat. 
The mast partners, fastened to the deck, hold it up. To lower the 
mast simply lift it up (about 600mm) and it is free. It will lie down 
on top of the rolled up sail/boom.

I believe Little Cruiser's mast folds down.

Where in Don's articles?

In Don's articles it says that you can pull out a pin and lower the mast. After looking at construction photos it seems that most people aren't including this pin? Is this correct? And the mast tilts forward or back? 

(As a side note what I was referring to as canted masts before is really raked masts)
