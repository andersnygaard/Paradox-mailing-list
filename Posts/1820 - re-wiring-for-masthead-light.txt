Subject: Re: Wiring for masthead light

I brought my wires out below the solid top to the mast and ran it up the outside from there. If you use the dimensions given there is very little room past the sheave and its axle to go inside.

A cunning plan would be to run a couple of copper strips up the outside at the top before wrapping it in glassfibre. 

I wish I had thought of that 2 years ago  :-(
