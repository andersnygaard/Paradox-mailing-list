Subject: Re: Mast electrical wires

I fitted a waterproof conector, of a type similar to <http://www.maplin.co.uk/Search.aspx?criteria=waterproof%20connector&amp;source=15&amp;SD=Y> with the panel mounted part at the foot of the mast. I can then insert the lead from inside through the vent. 

Bill brought the lead out through the side of the mast, below deck level, which makes fitting/removing the mast more difficult. If you want to bring the lead out through the side of the mast I would suggest you do it above the deck
