Subject: Paradox 140%

Okay, I'm not posting this to stir up trouble, but welcome all commentary.

If one were to increase the hull size of the paradox (e.g. 140%) which happens to be the most I could store in my garage. And if one were inclined to have a small mizzen. And a small forward placed centerboard, while keeping the chine-runners.

What other crazy things might one want to consider in this enormous little 'paracruiser' that would still be smaller than many trailerable sailboats (e.g. more water ballast)?

How would one get diagrams of little cruiser, for more ideas?
