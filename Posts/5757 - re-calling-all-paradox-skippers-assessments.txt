Hi Jeff,

Fine on all you say. I suppose a dozen boats is a respectable number. I was thinking more of the 100's of PDR owners! Anyway, we'll have to wait and see the outcome of your request.

I'd say that the popular departures from the plans were:

The water tanks,
Rear cabin opening
Bulkhead #2 modification.

Of those, I have done away with the in-built tanks, modified the cabin opening, and will have a different fairlead for the mainsheet. I'll report back when I have something positive (or negative!) to say about my choices.

Regards,
