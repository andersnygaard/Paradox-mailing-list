Subject: Re: Being on the Edge

If, when sailing with a following wind, you allow the peak of the yard to swing forward of the mast with the boom still aft of the mast then the air flow at the top of the sail will be from luff to leach and the flow at the bottom of the sail will be from leach to luff. This will almost guarantee a Chinese gybe.

The solution is to keep the peak aft of the mast.
