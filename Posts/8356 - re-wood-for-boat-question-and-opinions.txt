Shape the pieces first. The forward edge of the side pieces can be left oversized as this can help the next step.

Fit the tapered front and rear pieces to one side, making sure the mast is not bent. This is made easy because the rear of the mast is straight.

Fit the top and bottom plugs, paint/seal the inside and fit any internal wiring etc.

Fasten on the other side.

Round off the corners and make it look pretty.

Thank you for your response, Malcolm. 

I found a lumber yard that is four hour drive. They stock the DF for
boat building and allow customers to select their wood from the yard.
I shall plan a trip on a weekend to get the lumber for the mast and
spars.

A beginner's question regarding the mast shaping: Does one epoxy the
mast wood together then shape (taper) the mast -- such as decreasing
circumference toward the top of the mast -- or have folks kinda
shaped the individual strips then epoxied the pieces together? 

Much appreciation to those who have the skills and knowledge and most
of all the patience for new learners, Deric
