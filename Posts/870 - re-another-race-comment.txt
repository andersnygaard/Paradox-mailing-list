Hi Larry,

I was also wondering how efficientely a Seapearl rows with one 
person? At the beginning, there was very little wind. Obviously Matt 
knows how to use a yuloh as well as being a very skilled sailer, 
strategist and navigator:-) 

Perhaps he may have created a class of his own! The microcruiser 
class. Or gotten himself banned altogether!

Wave action really slows the light seapearl especially to windward where it is constantly thrown off the waves.  The heavy paradox powers through the slop with inertia.  The comfort motion of the paradox is much better on the body too.

Hi Nels,

What surprises me is that the Seapearl has not been more competitive.
