Last year I launched off the beach into Poole Harbour. The beach 
wasn't really steep enough for my not-to-be-submerged trailer and the 
boat required a certain amount of heaving over the sharp flinty 
bottom. I made a note to do a bit of repair work over last winter, 
but when I looked I couldn't see any damage worth repairing. Even the 
paint wasn't worth touching up. 

I suppose part of the reason is that it is virtually never dragged 
along on it's bottom as it is too heavy.

This winter the only maintenance work I intend to do, apart from 
stripping out the interior and giving it a good vacuum, is a fresh 
coat of B&amp;Qs best on the deck and sides, and replace the non skid on 
the deck. (=A32.50 for a 5m roll 25mm wide from Ikea).

Hoping for calm nights
