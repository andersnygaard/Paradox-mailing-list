Hi Shane

I though all PARADOX plans were in metric ? The problem we have here in
Australia is that our locally produced plywood is a metric size
(2400mm*1200mm) the imported stuff seems to actually fit the layout on
the plans better - Gaboon for instance is (2500mm*1220mm). This gives
us a problem with our plywood with bulkhead No3 at 1214mm wide if we
use Matt's sheet layout.

I have not yet started building the real thing yet but have a 1:5 scale
model in aircraft ply well advanced. Next step is to finish producing
the CNC files so I can cut the full size parts using a local CAD
cutting  service.

I would be happy to make the CNC DXF files available to Dave & Mindy
for distribution with plans set if that would be of interest to anybody ?

Best regards
