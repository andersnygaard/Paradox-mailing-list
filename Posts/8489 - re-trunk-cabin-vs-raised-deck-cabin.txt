Jack,

That's a good point about being close to the windows being a good thing. My previous boat was a Birdwatcher and the windows were hopeless to look out of. Being on the side of the boat (essentially a raised deck cabin) they were impossible to clean when underway. Most of the time I sailed looking out of the slot. I've wondered before on this list about looking out of a Paradox's windows, but nobody seems to mention it being a problem, so I think the fact they can be easily cleaned, are short and wide, are located away from the sides of the boat to avoid being splashed and you are close to them all adds up to windows that work. Looking through windows that slope might also be beneficial.

And now I have to wander out to my boat shed and admire Mini for a few minutes!

Cheers,

Rob.
