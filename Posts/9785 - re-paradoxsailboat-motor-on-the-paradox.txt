Interesting discussion on motors.

I live in a part of the world where weather can change suddenly and unpredictably - both on lakes and at sea.  A motor is comforting, convenient and perhaps a life saver when tide and wind are against you.

For these reasons I would choose to mount a small petrol motor. However my fellow paradox owner who lives near me does not have a motor and sees no need for one.

I guess it boils down to personal choice.

I like the idea of an electric motor but in my view the technology is not good enough yet. A petrol outboard has the advantage of greater range and perhaps greater power.
