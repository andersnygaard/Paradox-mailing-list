Hi Bill, 

Actually I was meaning the fabricated bits like the hoops for holding the yuloh and mast, the rudder hardware and the reefing bit on the forward end of the boom.  

I used tufnol and SS for the rudder fittings and boom axle, and more of the water pipe for the hoops. No problems so far ....

I wouldn't have thought about a lightning rod but it was on the plan so I guess I may as well put it on. (I don't know anything about how they work or how often boats get hit by lightning here but I doubt if it will hurt and shouldn't add much to the cost).

>I read that as the tack strop (rope) is 6mm inside a 14mm od pipe. 
>I used standard (in the UK) 12mm water pipe (because I had some)

I think 12mm is standard here too.

Thanks,

OzBill
