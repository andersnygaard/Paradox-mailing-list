Oh, that's a pity Geoff. If you download a little utility called 'Recover Form' it will automatically remember all the stuff that you typed in and magically make it re-appear again. Highly recommended to save you the tedium of doing it all again. 

Dying to hear about your trip. Have you seen http://cruisingashiki.blogspot.com.au/2014/05/shark-bay-shelter-bay-paradox.html 

Best,
