Hmm,

never thought about those issues, and I never had damage from chemicals(no 
motor, never occured to me to spray Deet on the windows)

But here's a thought. you could have the best of both world, and probably 
longer life.

 NASCAR race car drivers and helicopter pilots use Lexan windshields, but put 
a Mylar film over them. This film is readily available at auto supply stores 
as sunscreen for car windows, and at home stores for house window darkening, 
is easy to apply, and will peel off when scratched or dirty. Plus, it has good 
UV characteristics to protect the Lexan.

Mylar is a Polyester, which should be pretty resistant to chemicals, too. And 
it's cheap. Comes in shades from almost clear to near black. It could be 
reapplied once a season or so.

Actually, it could be applied to acrylic, too.
