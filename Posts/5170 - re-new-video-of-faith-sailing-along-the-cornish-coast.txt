Subject: Re: New video of 'Faith' sailing along the Cornish Coast

One of the reasons it is a great bit of film (if it is) is that the camera is not a compact. It has a 10x optical zoom, which means that I can take photos from my boat where the subject fills the picture. 
It also means that the camera sticks out quite a long way in front and won't fit any of these cases. 
Cameras, like boats, are always a compromise.
