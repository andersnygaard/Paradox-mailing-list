I have added the pics of the side motor mount I made. The size of the wooden pad is as small as needed for the Honda 2 HP motor. There is a hitch pin to lock and keep the inner end of the motor mount shaft not shown. I have not drilled the hole in the shaft for it yet. The purpose of the plastic ball valve it to keep the water out when the motor mount is removed. I added a stiffening shelf to brace up the area. The vent box area is just roughed in right now. I thought someone would benefit from the idea putting a groove through this area instead of drilling. Matt calls out for a plastic pipe but I'm using copper pipe for the grounding of the lighting protection. The Ironside of frame 3 gives me a laydown width of 44 inches side to side. I will add cloth bins later if needed.
