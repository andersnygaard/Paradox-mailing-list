Hi Derek,

I am sorry to hear of your Carpel Tunnel problem and hope you are back to normal very soon.

On the point that Bill Sergeant mentioned the other day- sleeping in the boat while it's on the trailer- presumably en route to a new cruising ground. Do many do that? Do you just pull into a lay-bye, climb into the boat and get your head down. Or pop into a camp site...;-)

I thought that there were rules that prevented folk dossing in lay-byes. ........perhaps they are not enforced that much and anyway, who could know that the owner is having a kip in the back?

Jim Hall
