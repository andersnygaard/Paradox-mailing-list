Hello everyone,

It's been a while since I posted as I have been very busy with my life and am moving forward by downsizing in order to prepare for a circumnavigation in the near future. 

My partner, who thoroughly enjoys sailing Zoe, thinks her Tanton 43 would be better suited to the task. So it is with a heavy heart that I have decided to part with her (Zoe that is). 

I have set the price at $6000 and feel she is worth that to me. Interested parties please contact me off-post or call pretty much any time at 386-658-3719.
