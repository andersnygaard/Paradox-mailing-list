I think the Paradox is a great light wind boat. It takes very little to get her to 2 knots. This is a very useful quality. Quite often I have this experience where I feel like the boat just suddenly loses her mojo and no matter what I do, she will just not get going. I think it is related to sheeting the sail in too hard. My junk sail is quite flat so I have to be careful about this in light breezes. I often think about getting a fuller sail made - still junk!
