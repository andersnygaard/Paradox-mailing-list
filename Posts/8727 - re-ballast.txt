Hi Rob

All good points, but I've only had this sail for about 3 years and really want to get more use out of it before forking out for another one..

I suspect that the camber was cut to my specification, so I must accept blame  - is slightly overdone and if I ever get aroud to replacing it I'll go for a bit less camber. But that would lead to other shortcomings...............

All sailmaking is a black art and if one is not careful, one would go chasing perfection for ever and never get sailing.  Some people in the junk sail world are forever messing about with altering and remaking sails and just keep going round and round.. I'm not like that,  being one of life's born lazy characters.

Best
Jim
