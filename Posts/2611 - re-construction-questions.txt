I have put a hole in Bulkhead 1 in my Enuf to allow for storing the spars inside. Why I might want to do this I'm not sure, but somebody has mentioned motorway service areas and disappearing spars in the past.
I have fitted exspanded polystyrene foam below the deck in the first compartment and filled the rest of it with empty 2 litre Pepsi bottles and an empty ice cream tub for bouyancy. The Pepsi bottles are silicone glued together so they won't float away in the event of a big hole.
I have split the floor aft of bulkhead 3 athwartships and put the anchors in blocks beneath the floor in front of the seat. The idea is that I should be able to lift out an anchor, attach the warp and put it out without leaving the cabin.
While on about anchors - I have a 15lb danforth type and a 14lb fisherman. I went for these weights after reading 'Beachcruising and Coastal Cruising', but see that Little Cruiser uses much smaller anchors. Any thoughts on suitable anchors for a paradox?
