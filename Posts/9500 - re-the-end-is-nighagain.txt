Greetings, Matt.

Glen and I co-own Paradoxowners2. I've granted you owner access there as well.

However, I'm only a moderator here on Paradoxbuilders. Glen is the sole owner, and as such, only he has the ability to grant owner access for the purpose of migrating to a groups.io platform. You may wish to communicate with him directly.

I still own Swashfrog and hope to one day complete her and set off on ambitious voyages. At the moment though, I'm refitting my Freedom 40', Eyrie of Astoria, converting her from cat/ketch to cambered-panel junk cat/schooner. My hands are full.

Thanks for your efforts and those of the group generally to keep this invaluable resource available for all.
