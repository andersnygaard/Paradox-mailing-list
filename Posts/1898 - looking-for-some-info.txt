Hi, 

I'm at the stage of installing the vent trunk, and the plans are very vague in the dimension department. I'm assuming the 420 mm length of the fir top is what we call 12 in S4S 11 5/8"? That would make the top width 11 5/8th or thereabouts. The base does not give anything in that department, neither is the pieces that make this part up, no mention on the nesting either. Now, if one is trying to stay within the "designed" specs this is difficult. More info is needed, or I'm off on my own. Or is this in the Don Elliot service pack 1 $?

Next is what to line the water tanks with? Food grade epoxy? Any info would be greatly appreciated before I close this area up.

Also, the bin sides, do they extend down to the hull bottom, or does the floor go all the way to the hull sides, again very vague, or is this open to the bottom.

Thanks, 

Jack
