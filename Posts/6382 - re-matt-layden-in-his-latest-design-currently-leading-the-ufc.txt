Thanks Pete, great photos!

I wonder if he and Sven collaborated on that vent system? Yrvind is big-time into the concept of keeping things as dry as possible inside.

Illusion will be lighter to portage as well as easier to get through some of the tight spots on the river where trees have fallen into water.

I just wish those wheels were a bit more sturdy. Maybe he has a spare this time.
