I've been wondering why that folder was empty, can we get copies of the ones on Don's group? I've never tried to join because I know he would ban me for spite.

Hi All

I've just uploaded 4 pictures to Photos. I've put them in my Enuf folder because it was empty anyway (not sure how that happened but my pics are now on Don's group instead)

I'm sorry for the delay in posting them Jack but I forgot.

Cheers   ......    Derek
