And they are't that light either.  I use a 2.5 short shaft nissan on my dingy and have used it on the seapearl tri also by dropping the motor mount very close to the water.  It really works quit well.  It's a one hander at 27 lbs.  Starts first pull almost always and pushes the tri at  hull speed 5.5 knots.  Though dirtier, the 2 cycles are a little lighter.  Good luck getting the weight down.  
Happy Turkey Day, 
Larry

Hi Larry,

   I still have a 55 lb motor on the back, This is part of my problem. I'm having trouble choosing another outboard. I like Yamaha. the new 2.5  is about 37 lbs. I'm not sure its light enough. my only other option is the Honda. 

Thanks

David
