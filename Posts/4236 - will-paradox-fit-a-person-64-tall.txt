Subject: will paradox fit a person 6'4' tall ?

I would like to be sure that there are no problems with my height and clearance in paradox. I understand that I can build a larger version but would prefeer to stay under 14'. I am not worried about the sleeping position but more the clearance when sailing.
Thank You,
Bill
