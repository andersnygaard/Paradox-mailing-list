Thanks Rob,

Looking at some of Jim's designs got my mind spinning with new ideas. I couldn't see any cover over the center opening except for the AF4Breve. I assume all of the birdwatcher style boats could have the same type of tent covering. One of the things that drew me to the Paradox was being able to operate it from inside and it looks like a lot of Jim's designs have that feature.

I'm not ready to build another boat right now but would consider the birdwatcher type boats until I can build the Paradox or another of Matt's boats. I'll have to do some more research. I still like the Paradox but it is a lot more involved and includes a lot of features that I wouldn't actually need unless I traveled to bigger waters than I have locally.

I shouldn't even mention it but ... Dockbox ????  Hmm...
