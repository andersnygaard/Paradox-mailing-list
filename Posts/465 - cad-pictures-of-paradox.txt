Hi all,

As I said a few weeks ago I am upgrading my CAD skills at work, and have been using the Paradox as a design exercise. I have tried 
to create the CAD model in the same way that the boat is constructed and I have found it has given me an insight into some of the design details that were not immediately apparent.

The results of my work have been distilled into 20 pictures which can be found at: http://www.asjg.clara.co.uk/paradox/index.htm

Feel free to copy them if you wish, and if anyone wants particular views with (or without) specific features then let me know.

Hoping for calm nights
