I would also propose that we have a folder in the file section containing "Frequently Asked Questions" or FAQ's.

This is because as new members join the same questions keep popping up over and over again and then the moderator or anybody else for that matter can simply refer them to that file rather than explain the same thing all over again.

Here are a few questions that come to mind off the top of my head:

1. Where and how can I obtain plans?
2. How do the chime runners work?
3. How effective are the chime runners?
4. Why does it not have a centerboard leeboards keel etc.?
5. How is the sailing rig designed and built? How does it reef?
6. How effective is Paradox going to weather?
7. How is Paradox propelled when there is no wind.
8. What is a yuloh?
9. How is a yuloh designed, built and used?
10. Can a motor be used? How big a motor?
11. What kind of plywood? How many sheets?

13. How to epoxy and glass. How much epoxy and glass? What weight?
14. Can the design be enlarged?
