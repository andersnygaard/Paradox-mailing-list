Hi Erik and Deric,

I'm always interested in lighter spars, too. One possible source is looking at carbon windsurfer masts. I used an old fiberglass mast on a little trimaran a few years ago as a test, and I didn't break it, although I didn't sail it in any really heavy winds. It was an encouraging -- and cheap -- experiment because I got the mast for free. 

Another path might be to contact the folks at Forte Carbon https://fortecarbon.com/ and see what they've got. Maybe there's some extra masts or booms sitting in the back room that they'd like to find a new home for. I've read about Hall Spars, too, as a good source for carbon spars. Supposedly the little Scout dinghy kit at Duckworks can be procured with a two-part carbon mast, so somebody out there must be producing them. But if you actually find something, make sure you're sitting down before you ask the price!

Cheers,
Jerry
