Hi,

I have been wondering if it might be possible to fit a (wire?) bridle to the boom, from end to end, then have the sheet attached at a fixed point on the bridle, above the rear deck. Sheet to go vertically down thru the deck above the curved baffle to catch any water. Tension on the sheet might keep the bridle clear of the rolled sail as its furled, especially if the aft boom mounting was via a tang of reasonable length. Would this work do you think, to keep the sheet away from the motor (and also the rudder).

Cheers,
Alan.
