Hi Jim.

I agree with you regarding the desirability of multifunction ballast.
If a small boat has room for batteries in place of ballast, cool. I
find that the problem is fitting a bunch of batteries into odd shapped
spaces in the bilge. One option to this end would be lots of little
batteries wired in parallel. Unfortunately, little batteries tend to
be more expensive on a dollar per amp hour basis. Of course there's
the matter of getting all of those suckers wet. Sure, AGMs and gel
cells could take it, but there's all that wiring.

Unfortunately, water as ballast is pretty inefficient. 

Reading your post made me aware of an error in my last post, regarding
the use of a completed (and removed) chine runner filler as a plug for
a casting mold. It can't be done this way. The plug would have to be
straight and fair on the only plane without a rolling bevel; the
bottom. This would require the plug to be fabricated on the bench. The
subsequent casting would then need to be wrapped around the hull.
Otherwise, yes, the bevels could be taken right off of the hull, and
plugs could be made from lumber, or doorskin, hot glue, duct tape,
modelers clay, etc, etc. The plug is then pressed into a trough of
plaster to make the casting mold. The mold would have to be completely
dry (baked) before casting, or there could likely be extremely
dangerous splatters/explosions due to steam.

And before I get some sleep.... there's the possibility of concrete
chine runner fillers. But not on my boat.

Have fun.
