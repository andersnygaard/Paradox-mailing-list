Yeah, I know about the censorship as I was warned by a couple of others. I'm tempted to suggest something crazy like hydrofoils on his list, just so I can call myself the victim of censorhship, but I will resist the urge.

Nothing on earth is static, especially such a personal affair as this. Unless you're in a racing class, what motivation there is to follow the original design to the tee simply evaporates.

I didn't realize there were already plans for Paradoxes this large - I will need to get Matt's plans to see what they look like.

I assumed I would need to double the bulkheads at such a great increase of size, so there's no surprise there.
