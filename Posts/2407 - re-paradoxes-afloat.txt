Derek,
No Problem, Hard to keep track of everybody building this Boat. I haven't had time lately to do very much on the Paradox. Just getting over the Flu too. I did get the Starboard Window in and Sealed, also the bottom guide for My "Sliding Hatch". Got a couple of days off soon so I will try and make some headway, And post some Photos.
I haven't named Her yet.

Thank You,
Dave Blow
