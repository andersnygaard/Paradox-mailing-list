Proaconstrictor, others,

If you want to read more about the Divinycell and sandwich theory, there is an interesting handbook to download at http://www.diabgroup.com/DIAB/filecabinet.nsf/LookupFiles/DIAB Sandwich Handbook/$file/DIAB Sandwich Handbook.pdf

It occurs to me that my postings have a slight Sweden-chauvinistic odour. Please forgive me. That is due to Sven Yrvind's thrive to be in full control of every detail, I think. (When he decided to have a inboard motor in one of his earlier Bris, he took a job at the norwegian manufacturer, to learn every screw). He wants to penetrate every chemical formula and get a personal relation to his suppliers, which limits the geographical radius. In this way he also gets respect and may recruit sponsors.
At least, this is my interpretation.

Anyhow, I am sure that, if you might be interesting of "the Bris material", you will find a compatible brand in a store near you.

Sincerely,
Kjell Karlsson
