Hello Greg,

I agree wholeheartedly with what you say about the dangers of petrol.
The few times I had a petrol can in the aft end of the cockpit I always 
took a full size bath towel, soaked it in the water and laid it over the
petrol can.  When the towel started to dry I would resoak it and replace
it over the petrol can.

I don't see why a small area large enough to carry 1/2 gallon or one 
gallon can of petrol under the paradox aft deck could not be
enclosed with fiberglass covering both the inside and outside with two
vents.  For entry there would be a small hatch with a rubber gasket in
the aft deck.  I see no reason why this would not be a safe thing to do.

The problem is that the tiller swings across under (most of) the 
after deck. Where Pete has suggested putting his cans is about the 
only place there is room. But, as he points out there are other 
problems.

I spent ages trying to fit an anchor well, accessed through the deck 
but finally accepted that it isn't feasible.

A boat is a compromise, don't destroy the things you like about a 
design to add some 'improvement'.

Hoping for calm nights
