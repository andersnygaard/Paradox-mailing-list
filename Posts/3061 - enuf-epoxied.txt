Exciting day here in Old Wallyhampton.

As of early this morning Enuf has a hard, shiny bottom and we are where we hoped to be a fortnight ago.

Yesterday we finished sanding the bottom after having filled all the gouges resulting from unskilled and low paid labour stripping off the onset epoxy and biaxial cloth. Labour costs were =A360 and half a dozen bottles of cold Stella.

At 1400 my boy mixed 1.5 litres of epoxy, measuring with jugs, and I started applying it to the hull. All of a sudden there was a shout and turning I could see the plastic pot melting, smoke rising from the epoxy and feel the heat from the pot as the epoxy went into overdrive. I chose that moment to hypo and lose my balance.
I was cured by a sweet drink and a blueberry muffin; the epoxy cured itself, and after that everything went well. It had gone off nicely by 2100 and we put a second coat, with fairing compound, on at midnight.

I'm leaving it for 36 hours and I've booked the neighbours for turning it right way up on Saturday morning. Looking forward to doing the cabin superstructure.

thanks to all those who gave helpful advice that can be summarised as 'dump the pump'!

Cheers  ...........  Derek
