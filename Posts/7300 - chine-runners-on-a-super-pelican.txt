Subject: CHINE RUNNERS ON A SUPER PELICAN

Hi all (again),

Let me start at the beginning.... I am working on the redesign of the San Francisco Pelican - the 18' super Pelican model. I've got everything in place (at least I believe they're in place).

Now here's my problem. I want to add "Chine-Runners" and get rid of that tremendous centerboard. I can draw it up okay but I need some input from "Paradox" builder as to its feasibility. Now that you've built your boats do you think the Chine-Runners can be transferred to another design? If I lay the Pelican drawing over the Paradox drawing they just about match (Chines).

I would appreciate any input (good or bad) about what I'm trying.

Thanks all - Aloha - Jack Spoering- ocala, fl
