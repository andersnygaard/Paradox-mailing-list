There's an article in the Cheasapeake Light Craft section on shop tips that will give you a start on building your own window. It's called "the Glass bottomed Mill Creek". I did something similar as a teenager (early sixties!) on a little skiff I bounced around Long Island Sound. That window was just to one side of a central skeg, which protected the plasric from scratching pretty well. The window was fine after the boat rotted out around it.With a boat like Paradox, I would keep the window small (under a sq, ft.) and add fasteners. 3/8 or 1/2 thick plastic is probably plenty thick Polycarbonates can be drilled and tapped fairly easily and are probably stronger than the plywood bottom. the rub strips in the article look like a great idea.When the scratches do get bad enough,Just sand them out.

Oh yeah, In the open skiff, I had to build a cone shaped box which I placed over the window for daylight viewing. This may not be necessary inside the cabin of the Paradox
