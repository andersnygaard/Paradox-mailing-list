Hi,

I plan to build a paradox in the near future. So I thought I should start gathering supplies. What I need to know is how much lead am I going to need to order? The plans say 70 to 180kg that seems to me to be quite a difference between the two weights . I know it all comes down to what materials I use and so on. Is there an average amount? So I don't order more than I need.

Thanks for the help.
