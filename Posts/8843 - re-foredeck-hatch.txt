Sorry to hear you wrenched your back. When you are feeling better, take a look at Foundation Training. It is a series of exercises to strengthen the back and posterior chain. I have been doing them for 2 years now and it has helped my back. This is a video of the basic "Founder" exercise.

Good luck,
