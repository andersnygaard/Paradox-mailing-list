In the files section of this forum there is a folder called "rudder blade". I think the pictures of this rudder being leaded are for Little Cruiser? Is this right? Dave B. has provided the pics and they are alittle confusing to me as I don't know if this is for a different boat or is it showing an alternative method of putting lead in the blade for a paradox? The method and placement seem to be different then in the plans and illustrations in Don's manual.

Also in putting the proper aerofoil onto the rudder blade I noticed the dimensions given for the smaller end (the end with the lead) is 6mm. However there are no dimensions given for the end where the radius begins. (opposite small end)  And do I only shape the blade to the waterline?  Also do I shape the lead on the smaller edge down to 6mm? I "think" I know some of the answers here but I would like to know for sure. 

Thanks.... Rod
