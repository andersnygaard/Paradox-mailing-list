Subject: Re: Very nice Paradox available in Western Australia


More photos attached showing her dried out in Shark Bay, anchored somewhere nice but I forget where, and down below doing some cooking on a fold out camp stove.

Some more details: she has an electrical system consisting of two 20 watt solar panels fixed to the stern deck, a morningstar controller, accomodation for a deep cycle battery just forward of the mast (I've previously used a 100 Ahr, but later found a 50 Ahr battery was plenty), a fused switch panel including cigarette lighter type socket, two interior lights, and anchor light on the top of the mast.

The price... yes very difficult to come up with the right price because I only know of one previous paradox sale, and even if there were lots of sales data, the build quality varies quite a lot. I am asking $6000 (negotiable). Material costs, trailer and sail would be about double what I am asking, so hopefully this is a somewhat attractive asking price for someone.

Please keep asking whatever questions you have. I will keep answering, and eventually there will be enough info in this thread for you to form a reasonable view of what is on offer.
