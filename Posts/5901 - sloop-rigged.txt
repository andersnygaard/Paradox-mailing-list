Hi,

Newbie here, so please be gentle!

Been sailing on and off for 26 years, and looking for a cheap, portable pocket cruiser for weekend sailing in the Lakes etc.

Having looked at Andersons, and Seawytchs, I stumbled across the Paradox whilst looking into sail canoes.

I very much like the look of this craft, and not averse to putting in the hours to build one. 

And here's the question.

I've done a search through here for sloop rigged Paradox's, found lots of discussions, but no conclusive statements as to whether the basic design can be modified to run a sloop rig.

So, can anyone help?

Many thanks, 

Matt
