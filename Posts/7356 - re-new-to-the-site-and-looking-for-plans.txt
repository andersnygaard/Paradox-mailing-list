Subject: Re: New to the site and looking for plans

You won't regret buying the plans they are really well done and cost less than most study plans.  I have to commend Matt for pricing them so fairly.  I got mine as part of a package from buying another boat but I would have would have wanted a set just to be able to read through all the paradox details.  There is a build booklet I did buy from Wanda Elliott (the authors widow) that is also well with it if you don't have a lot of boat building experience. Booklet is an understatement it is a book.  More technique related experience (you still need the plans) but it will help give you an appreciation for the amount of work getting the plans right must have been.  It will also get to use some of your dream energy productively towards planning the build.  Tom
