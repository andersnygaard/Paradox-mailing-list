     Dave, 
 
   Honestly, I have reserved my comments on your project because I could not comprehend using poly for anything but a pair of retro disco pant suits. You have made a great decision to better your boat, Im a west system user and have never been let down by it. I have total so far 3 gallons into the paradox, using 12 oz biax on the hull instead of the roven woven saved a ton and it is holding up VERY well, also I have no nails or screws in the boat save for the hardware, also I used 2 layers of 2 oz on the upper hull to stop the checking. Oh and you will also find that your gonna need more ballast than 200 lbs :-) you have to get the boat down in the the water to perform. And I feel that the strip planked deck will be much better with epoxy than poly. All you would need is a little flex in it and the poly will shatter under the paint, let in moister and the rest is history. Not to mention you would need some sort of gel coat over the poly.
