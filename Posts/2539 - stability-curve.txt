Subject: Stability Curve
To: paradoxbuilders@yahoogroups.com

Whilst browsing recently I came across a plot of righting moment vs heel angle for Paradox (or it might have been for Little Cruiser).
I neglected to print it or to note where to find it again,

Can anyone recollect this curve ?  I've been searching hard ever since
