Well, I hope they are waterproof. The one in the transom doesn't bother me much, but the two on the water tanks had better be or else we are going to be in trouble as our ballast/drinking water joins us in the cabin.

Remember, if the transom plate leaks it should just drain back out through the tiller vent as it is above the baffle.


Hoping for calm nights
