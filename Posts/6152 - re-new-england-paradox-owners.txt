construction sequence

Well either I have read it wrong or you have. None of my nails went
into the ply end grain they all went into the cleats (That's the only
reason for them to exist as far as I can see).

Whoops, no you are right, bulkhead 3 (18mm) does not have any cleats
on the sides. I think I used 2 nails either side as location pins
into pre-drilled holes.

That said, it is so strongly constructed that stitch and glue should
make a perfectly good boat. In fact I did consider assembling mine
without the chine logs or sheer clamp, just putting epoxy fillet in after assembling bottom and deck. Fortunately common sense prevailed.

I went same route,

I installed chine logs, a plus, makes for a fair curve and lots of glue area, fillets and tab is just a bonus. if the boat were to strike at the bottom corner on the hull, it would have to hit very hard to break all, instead of just a plywood and fillet corner.
