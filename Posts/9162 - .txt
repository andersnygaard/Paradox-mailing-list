Subject: Paradox Update

After working all winter at completing the unfinished Paradox I purchased last year (everything but the shell), I will be christening =ABPeque=F1o=BB today on the Saguenay river here in Qu=E9bec Canada.  I now own two Paradox sailboats, this second one is to loan to my sailing friends, it was my dream to sail in company with these boats.  Having just returned from two consecutive 10 day trips with buddies in my two Gorfniks, I can tell you that it is a great pleasure to share such adventures.  Really looking forward to more intense two-boat trips in bigger waters with the Doxes.

I think that the 250 km circumnavigation of Lake St-Jean near here will be my first go, as soon as I find a willing partner. Will post here in due time.

Hope you are all having as much fun.

PS  Maybe Deric or other Paradox owners on the East Coast would care to join me? Send me a personal E-mail!
