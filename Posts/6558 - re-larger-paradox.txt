Yes it would likely be too heavy for that purpose-you'd have more trouble than it's worth with trailering and man-handling IMO. I believe it would be more of a true 'cruiser' than a 'camper'. There are several somewhat similar designs from Michalak in the Jewel Box vein which would likely be more suitable. (IMB, Philsboat, Caroline and several others.)Not for blue water tho!
Cheers,
