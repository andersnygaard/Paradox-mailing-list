Subject: Re: Coastal vs Blue Water

From the standpoint of a "conventional" boat, the differences between a blue water and a coastal cruiser are such things like (for a bluewater boat):

* Heavier construction
* Fewer and smaller windows.
* Smaller cockpit
* Real sea berth(s)
* More water and fuel capacity
* More displacement (generally)
* More draft (generally)
* More or less sail area than a coastal cruiser
plus maybe other things I can't think of at the moment! ;)

For the unconventional boats like Sven and Matt's boats, there's no cockpit, the construction is already heavy for the scale of the boat, there's only one real berth (which may be too wide to be a good sea berth - see below!) and total capacity is limited by the size of the boat.

Speaking of capacities, I just reread Testa's "500 days" about his circumnavigation in a (slightly under) 12' (!!!!) boat. He regularly spent 40-50 days at sea and neither starved or died of thirst ;)

BTW, it sounded like a rather miserable experience much of the time. Waves crashed over the boat even in fair weather, forcing him to stay below with the hatch closed in a poorly ventillated cabin, his single living area/berth was too wide to get himself wedged in for comfort in storms, he was shipwrecked (doing no harm to him or his aluminium craft), he ran aground with alarming regularity and a whole slew of other unpleasant experiences. He was frank about doing it for the fame and fortune. In comparison, the Arrandir, at 14' seemed palatial by comparison!
