Thank you all for the replies. 

Pete, it never occurred to me that the latex gloves might be a source of the problem - until I looked at the box - "...contains natural rubber latex, which can cause allergic reactions."

Once the rash has subsided (it's 3 or 4 days now and the itching is so bad at night I haven't slept a wink for days), I think the best way forward is just to change one thing at a time and try to isolate the cause. As gloves are cheaper than epoxy, I've got some vinyl gloves and will try them - if it isn't them I'm in for some more hardship!

Of course, I could get some medical advice to narrow the problem down but that could take 6 months just to get an appointment... Not really an option.

All rather frustrating, but we shan't give up, this little boat is worth the effort, I think.
