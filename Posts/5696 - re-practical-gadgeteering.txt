I thought it would do in a pinch and when the yuloh was difficult to use.

Hi Steve,

I have uploaded a photo of Whisper's outboard when fully down.  You can see it in the Whisper album.  My bracket is slightly higher than his, which means I can motor with the engine fully down in water which is about 15 inches.  Before beaching I invariably set the outboard in its tilted position.

Having experienced using an engine on Paradox, I would not be without one.  I have the assurance that I can make up over some of the fierce tides here on the East Coast of England.

Regarding the smells you mentioned in a previous post.  In actual fact, by using a four-stroke engine such as the Honda 2.3 which does not use oil, smells are almost non existent.  There are arguments for and against using such an engine on a Paradox have been well aired in the past. Each must make his own choice.  I'm pleased with mine.

For anyone who intends mounting an outboard on the port side of the transom, don't bother to build a boarding step, because it can't be used when the engine is mounted.  Also do not put too much faith in using it to get back on board without the additional use of a loop of rope lower than it for the first foothold.  I know through painful experience how hard it is to get back on-board by using the step.  Because it is almost at water level you need to be a freak to place your foot on it and then grab the top of the rudder stock to hoist yourself aboard.  I did it out of pure survival instinct.  Do not underestimate the difficulty when water has soaked into your clothing which makes you a 'dead' weight when your body emerges from the water.

Bill.

Not for shallow water usage, then. What would you do with it when it is stowed?

I see you have left off the boarding step from the rudder. Why did you do that? I find the step very usefull when setting off from a beach.
