The stove control is easy to reach and if needed, I simply lift the 
stove off its support into which it clips.

I used this very stove on my Hunter 19 that I sailed across the 
North Sea and the full length of the English Channel.  It is well 
proven.

Since taking them I've made the seat and I'm just about ready
