I think most the boat is designed to sail. I can only see using an outboard in times of emergency or puttering around a marina for a short time. I dont think it should be used on this boat more than that. I mean if u run out of energy well, try the beans.

In my previous tirade I forgot to mention shore power.

If one goes electric you will certainly have to carry a smart charger and some way to safely connect it to shore power, which really adds up cost wise..

But the biggest cost is renting a slip in order to connect up to shore power. And what do you do if all the slips are full and your batteries are getting empty? Rental slip fees will more than eliminate any savings from using solar energy to keep the batteries charged. Besides, solar cells will not re-charge deep-cycle batteries in any timely fashion - to the degree that a trolling motor uses it.

I already have a 1250 watt Kawasaki 4-stroke genset, two deep-cycle batteries, 4 solar panels, controller/regulator and smart charger and all I need is the trolling motor. (The torqedo is state of the art so I am told.) My little gas outboard would be pretty hard to give up though.

One drawback for me is the sound of the genset as it runs at a constant rpm level that is not bad in the city but out in the big wide open - it really sounds annoying compared to a small outboard running at about 1/3 throttle..
