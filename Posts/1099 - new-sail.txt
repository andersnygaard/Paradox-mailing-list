Hi All,

I received my new sail from Dabbler the other day and was able to get out earlier in the week to try it out. I sailed off Keaton Beach over on the gulf coast and Nancy went out on the end of the pier and took a bunch of pictures as I sailed back and forth. I have up loaded some of them to the ParadoxBuilders photo section under the Zoe folder for those interested. 

As for my impressions, the sail is the Mark II version and was beautifully made. I was very impressed with the workmanship and it fits perfectly. In the pictures you will notice that I can now cut off about six inches of the end of the boom, which was Matt's intention when he drew up the new sail plan. As for performance difference, there is no comparison. This sail has a lot of draft in it and powers up very quickly. I can now not tell any difference in performance from one tack to the other (a problem with the old sail). I am also able to trim in much tighter with out stalling the sail and as a result am able to point higher. 

I can highly recommend Dabbler to anyone looking for a quality small boat sail and especially one of lug, spritsail or Gunter rig. I will warn you that he is a little pricey but I think here it is a case of getting what you pay for. Had I known about Dabbler and gone with him to begin with I would be $400 richer.
