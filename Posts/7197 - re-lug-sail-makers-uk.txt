Faith's sail has done some service. It was on Zoe before she had the mark 2 version.
Hope you can get the time off to be at Cobnor, 3 paradoxes together in the UK would be great. I thought there may be a Paradox Owners Association one day. 
Glad to see that you are enjoying your boat.
Tomorrow is my last day of a 6 day cruise at Poole Harbour in me 'C' Type West Wight Potter. In some respects she is similar to a Paradox.
Cheers,
Bill.
