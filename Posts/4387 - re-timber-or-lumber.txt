Subject: Re: Timber (or lumber!)

Good point I never thought of that. An electric planer is one thing I haven't got, and it could be useful for doing the scarfs as well with a bit of practice.

Very true.
What has amazed me is the number of splinters I've had this week! With the number of times I've brushed a bit of dust off the edge of a board and ended up spearing myself, you'd think I'd learn quicker :-(

The timber yard I visited today was right next door to Lidl. I knew there was something I wanted to go and look at. I wasn't intending on buying a portacrapper initially, I was brought up to bucket and chuck it in my previous boats! I'd want to store it in the forward state room. I assume it's small enough to fit through the bulkhead opening. 

I see Lidl have some Sheets, halyards and mooring lines next Thursday.
