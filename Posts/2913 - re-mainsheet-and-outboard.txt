Hi,
 
I too would like to use a paradox to get around the UK canal and river system but without a motor on the end. So why can't a yuloh be used all day, given that you would have to stop quite often in the canal system to lock in and out? Also, there is the alternative of pulling the boat along the towpath as was done in days of old. By the way, does anyone know the method, i.e., rudder and rope control? Given the speed limit of 4 mph, both ways should be easy to do, I hope.
