Hi Rod. I would think that a PARADOX might be a better sea boat than a West Wight Potter 14. So here is something to ponder over. http://potter-yachters.org/stories/vanruth.html

Subject: [paradoxbuilders] To Hawaii?

Wow... I just made two life decisions based on extreme thought over the last few weeks. One of these decisions has no place on this forum (economy has forced me back into performing magic for a living), but I thought somebody out there may find the 2nd decision interesting. I have decided to go ahead and definitely plan on taking my paradox on a trip to Hawaii. I will try to complete her by 2010 for a trial run to the Bahamas but if I miss the dead-line there I will leave A.S.A.P for Hawaii. I'm going anyway, crazy fool that I am, but I would not mind a show of hands of the people here who believe a "properly built to plans" paradox is capable of such a trip. I am very serious and would only decide against this if enough of the "experts" here were against it. So from Marina Del Rey, CA. to Honolulu in a paradox, what do u think?

Thanks for any input as I will give all thoughts consideration,
Rod
