Subject: Steel? 

I have a question, I was wondering if using steel in the hull bottom, something like 1/4 " or so. Benefits would be, getting away from the lead, bring the CG lower. Incorporate some of the ballast into the floor could trim out the rest with smaller areas of lead. You would also gain storage area in the floor space. Another plus is the piece of mind that if you hit that partially submerged shipping container you would skid over it with most likely no problems, also it would be very durable when grounding on sand bars and rocks. However, I'd imagine it would add some questions about how to attach... I know epoxy on abraded steel works well, but the expansion and contracting of dissimilar materials may be a problem. Also, do we want most of the ballast weight in the center of the vessel or spread out to the ends??
