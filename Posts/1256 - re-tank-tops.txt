I am not convinced that the extra stiffness is necessary, however if 
I decide to replace the water with lead I intend to cut the tank tops 
3 inches in from the dividers and make removable hatches. The 
loss in stiffness should be small while still providing good access.

Hi All,

I need some advise, Whispers tank Tops are hinged like the aft
storage bins, according to Matts plans they are suppose to be
structural. I like the storage space. Is there any way to beef up this
space and be able to keep the hinged tops ?
