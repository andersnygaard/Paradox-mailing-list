Sorry for the late reply just got back from vacation.

Must be my misunderstanding, but when a design lists the displacement 
like 1410 lbs is that the displacement to float her on her designed 
waterline? I always thought the displacement was the total amount of 
water the hull displaces as if it were full of water.
