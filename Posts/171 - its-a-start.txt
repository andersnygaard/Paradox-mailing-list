Hi Group,

Phew, is this boat tough or what? (I mean on this exasperated boatbuilder)Just spent all day marking out the panels and bulkheads and making up a material list or three.

I remember reading something about the ply layout not being ENTIRELY correct. True. This happened to me too Al. I moved Bulkhead #2 over 40mm (therefore 511mm wide starboard side, 591mm wide port side or something like that).  Found out the transom wouldn't fit as indicated: no worries! Just put one of the rudder blades in there (just fits) and put the transom on the other sheet.

Also noted that the vent trunk pieces (18mm front, 9mm sides) and the breasthook, butt blocks (12mm) and some other pieces are not noted on the layout (can't have everything can ya? TANSTAAFL) So be careful when cutting out (that's on Monday folks!) Plan to use those leftovers. 

Enough ranting. Love this boat. 

Question: when is it best to resin soak the sheets of ply? When they are cut out into pieces (small and large) or in their virgin state (i.e. 8 foot by 4 foot slabs?) 

Or until the boat is near assembled? Any help here Glen?

See ya folks, havagoodweekend.

Chris
