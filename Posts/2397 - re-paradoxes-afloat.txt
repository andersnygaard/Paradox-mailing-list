From some rough notes I scribbled down a while ago I have also:
DC US Swash
Ronald de Hon Amsterdam RHXII
Chris Becker Aus Walden

though some of them may still be building. Others that I have as building are:

Jeff Forrest US
Paul (kayaker37) US
Jack Gardiner US (stitch & glue)
Steve US Kansas City
Kjell Karlsson Sweden? (Bris construction)
and, of course:

Derek Clark UK (Wolverhampton)

My apologies if I have got any of this wrong.

Hi all,

How many Paradoxes are now afloat? Does anybody know the names of the boats and their owners' names and nationality? If I start with the ones I can think of, can others complete the list, please?

Matt Layden: Paradox USA
Glen Maxwell: Zoe USA
Don Elliot USA
David: Whisper USA
Jack USA Petite Lady NZ
Zero Australia
Al Law Little Jim UK

There's the eight I can think of, but I thought there were more.
How many are under construction and where?

Derek

Hoping for calm nights,
