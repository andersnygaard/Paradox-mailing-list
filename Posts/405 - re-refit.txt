If I can find the right stuff to do the fitting, It will cost $0. We have a High tech machine shop at work. They owe me a few favors. The machines are CNC, So once you get the setup right its just as easy to do 3 or 4 as it is to do one.

I doubt if nylon is as strong as epoxy glass,  but is the nylon strong enough?

I do not know.

What effect does salt and ocean critters have on the strength of nylon?  

What effect does freezing and UV have on nylon?  Like when the boat is sitting in your side yard all winter?

Nylon is such a common material I am sure the answers are available, but I do not know were to point you.

In any case I would be interested in a case I would very much like a copy of the lower rudder fitting.

When you talk to the machine shop see if you can get a better price by saying you want two of them and let me know how much to send you.

Thanks
