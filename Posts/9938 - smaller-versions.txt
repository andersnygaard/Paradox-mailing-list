Hi everyone!

We're looking at building a couple of smaller (3m) boats and I was wondering if anyone had information on enigma or elusion they could share? I can probably work it out from the paradox plans and pictures I've found online, but I know some folks have build little ones before so it seemed worth asking. Even just a table of offsets or something would be super useful.

We're also planning to use portage wheels. I thought I had read that Matt had a good system for portage wheels that were easily stowable. Do any of you have info on that?

Thanks so much, and I hope you all have a beautiful day!

Molly.
