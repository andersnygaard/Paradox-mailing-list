Well thats a relief to hear. Less parts to make!.
Thanks Al. Steve Yahn

The way the sail rolls onto the drum is dependent on the taper of the sail and the angle at the tack. The Mk 1 sail has a tack angle of nearly 90 degrees so it furls pretty much on top of itself. The Mk 2 has an angle greater than 90 degrees so wants to move forward on the boom as it rolls up.

I don't think that trying to control the sail with some sort of fence would work, it would just jamb up. As Derek found, you can't fight it, you have to position the sail on the boom so that it has room to do what it wants, that way you don't get any arguments from it.

As for the line falling off the drum, this system differs from a simple headsail furling gear in that the furling line is never left slack. In 3 seasons use I have never had even a suggestion that the line wants to come off the drum. On the other hand, the topping lift (the only bit of my rig *I* designed) does quite often foul up.
