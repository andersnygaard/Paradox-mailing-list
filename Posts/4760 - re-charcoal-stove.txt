I'd wondered about the idea of cabin heat. The set-up I've seen is the cook stove in the lazarette, presumably venting out the transom, and I wondered how much heat it might throw into the cabin--undesirable in summer, welcome in winter. On the one hand, it would be hard to devote space in so small a cabin to a dedicated heater, but cookstoves aren't really designed to leave running pretty much unattended. The thing I'd worry most about (maybe after fire risk) is poisonous stove emissions. Kerosene is good fuel, but it needs to be adjusted to produce a nice blue (that is, soot-free) flame. The chimney would have to strike a good balance between keeping the air clean and not letting all the heat go up the chimney...

Thanks to all who offered help. I looked at all the suggestions and pondered over the matter. Trying to heat a paradox cabin would allow me a nice, and longer cruising season. The notion of a kerosene/paraffin lamp for a heater, instead of charchoal would be much cleaner. With no ashes. So, I see a metal can as a heat dissapater,and a chimny thru the roof. The burner/wick assembly from a big lantern in/under the bottom of the can. This should be something to try. Best, Steve Yahn
