I did not know a gas engine for the paradox would burn so little fuel. Wow...Once my paradox is built I will only be taking it to Catalina Island from Marina Del Rey, however, as I will only be making weekend trips, a motor might be handy. Once I become skilled and more comfortable with the boat and have more time I can see using it alot less. Considerable wind on this coast all the damn time it seems.

Thanks Bill, that's very reasonable. I knew that the little Honda didn't burn much fuel, but I didn't know how hard it had to work to move the Paradox.. Apparently it doesn't have to work very hard at all.

That little Honda sounds like a pretty nice motor, I'll have to look it up and do some research on it.

Thanks Bill
