Hi David.

I used a single piece of 5/4 Douglas Fir.  I chose the grain so that I could fit both pieces with little grain run out.  The grain was quite straight, but ran slightly diagonal on the piece of lumber.  I'm sure that any number of different species and/or quality would work fine.

Enjoy yourself.  The yuloh is a fun little project.
