Well I hope to start building something next year after my 65th birthday when I'm due to slow down on the work stuff.

Not 100per cent sure it would be an unmodified Paradox, though, as I found the cabin headroom very uncomfortable when I visited your boat a few months ago. 

Ah, now that's got me thinking....what if I increased the headroom by lowering the cabin sole a bit?..........that would leave a bit less rooom for ballast.........so add sheet steel screwed to the existing plywood bottom...extra damage resistance and weight where you want it? Wadyouthink?

As Jeff said, there is no shortage of storage space, even with a lowered sole. I wouldn't add the hassle of a steel bottom though, but copper is another matter .....

Hoping for calm nights
