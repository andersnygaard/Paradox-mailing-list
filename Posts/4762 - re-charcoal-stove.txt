Thanks to all who offered help. I looked at all the suggestions and pondered over the matter. Trying to heat a paradox cabin would allow me a nice, and longer cruising season. The notion of a kerosene/paraffin lamp for a heater, instead of charchoal would be much cleaner. With no ashes. So, I see a metal can as a heat dissapater,and a chimny thru the roof. The burner/wick assembly from a big lantern in/under the bottom of the can. This should be something to try. Best, Steve Yahn

Be careful not to slice off the chimney when you open the hatch.

Hoping for calm nights
