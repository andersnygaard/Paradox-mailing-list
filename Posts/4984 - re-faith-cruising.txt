Bill, wonderful stuff. I plan to follow along vicariously on your adventure. You write very well.

In reading your blog, I discovered that you have an Asus eee. I've considered one as well, because of the presumed durability of the machine, but a cheap full-featured laptop isn't a great deal more than the Asus, and as I understand it, the latter has no optical drive. I'd like to be able to play DVDs-- I can get a half-dozen compressed movies and many many hours of music on a single DVD, which might prove entertaining.

Now if I can only find room for the wine cellar and the hot tub aboard my microcruiser...
