Subject: Re: Charcoal Heater

Thanks Jim,

The little heater looked like a great, simple design to take the chill off without taking up much space.  Looking at the pictures I'm guessing 4 or 5 inches high.  For the sliding doors I'm guessing a section of pipe was split with the cut edges bent back as handles.  I'm also guessing that gloves or maybe even a wrench is used to adjust them to keep from burning yourself.  It also seems like the charcoal needs to be broken up a little to fit in.  I read a message that said you feed it with a teaspoon.

If I got anything wrong let me know.  I'm figuring sizes don't have to be real precise as long as it works.

I think just having a Paradox (built or bought) means you have a lot to offer to the group.  I just now got the plans and still don't know if I will build it or maybe one of Matt's other designs.  It does look like a great little cruising/camping boat.
