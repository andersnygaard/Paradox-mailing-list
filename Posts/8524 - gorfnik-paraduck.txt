Hi everyone,

I have removed photos from the Gorfnik album as promised. Just to let those of you interested know that I just finished posting the final build sequences in the Microcruising group.

Meanwhile, I'm in the process of changing the windows on my Paradox «Iota». After 5 years, the original windows made of 1/8 inch plexiglass failed. Be advised not to skimp on the window thickness!
