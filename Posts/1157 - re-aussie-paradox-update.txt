For Little Jim I have adopted a system I used to use when camping/diving. I have a 0.5" thick camping sleep mat with 2 foam blocks fixed to it. One is under my shoulder and head, and the other is under my hips. These give support where the pressure points are but takes up much less room than a full mattress.

I find it very comfortable, YMMV.

Hoping for calm nights
