Sitting room height is all that needs to be considered=85..when not 
sailing, if you just provide a "pop up" top in the center portion of 
the cabin. The sides of the pop top can be any material that will 
shed water.  Holding the top up only takes one stanchion in the 
middle or two at the side or end.  The side material when in tension 
will prevent any racking loads.    In public, I find it important to 
be able to stand up even hunched over a little just to put on my 
pants or sponge off.  Some minor details are not included here but 
they would be easy to provide.

Hi Bert,

I have just measured Little Jim and reckon there is an absolute 
maximum of 37 inches from sole to hatch cover. But this may not be 
all bad news.

If I sit up straight I need 35 inches (without a cushion). This 
would 
suggest that I would be banging my head on the roof beams. However 
I 
never sit up straight but spend my time lounging and have never 
come 
near to head banging.

If you wanted to you could raise the cabin roof slightly (but be 
aware of the impact this would have on the sail stowage) or, 
probably 
safer, lower the sole.

If the access into the forward storage area (often referred to as 
the 
forward stateroom) is cut level with the cabin sole this gives 
another 30 inches of leg room when sleeping. I have done this on 
Little Jim, so that that I can stow my bicycle, without any problems.

Probably the only way to really be sure if it would be ok is to go 
and look at one.

Hoping for calm nights
