In regards to the plywood, I would 
just use fir marine grade wood for the hull and be done with it. 
Seal it with epoxy inside and apply fiberglass outside, and you 
should be fine.
    
LOL.  OK, OK, fir it is.  I don't mind saving money. :)

So does anyone have a reliable source of this A/B Fir?  There is
a difference between marine AB and exterior AB right (assuming
not edge voids for the marine AB), right?  I want to do some
preliminary shopping, but I'm a little overwhelmed by all the
variety and standards, and I'm a little unsure of what I need to
take a look at and ask for.

Lastly, the automatic "anchor" light I mentioned 
isn't really intended to be legal. It's just something I'm putting 
together so that we can find our boat in the dark after we've 
forgotten to put the masthead light on and we've been partying 
ashore or on someone else's boat.  Since the light is mounted at 
deck level, it's easier for us to find it than those lights mounted 
high up that can be mistaken for stars.

Just install "The Clapper" to your masthead light. :P
