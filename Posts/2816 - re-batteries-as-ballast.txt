Subject: Re: Batteries as ballast?

I've been thinking along the same lines since seeing the Minn Kota outboards - thanks for doing the sums Bill - I can't think why batteries shouldn't be used as ballast. My hang up is the recharging of them. I don't want to be dependent on marinas and there isn't a lot of room for a generator on a Paradox.
