Heh... Don't know if anybody has watched the Boaters TV but every since I became a boat nut I have been tuning in and now have a profile there.

I won the Captains Caption of the day... so if you want .. check it out.. let me know what you think.. the vid will change on Friday.  At the end you can see what caption I put for the picture they show in the beginning. Only about 6 min. vid total.. nice show.
