Just had a phone call from Gordon Lamb of Robbins (boss of Sarah Suck Teeth) and he is not happy that they sent me a piece of obviously weak wood.

Replacement on its way - no charge for timber or carriage.

Would I mind a delay of 7 to 10 days - No, I wouldn't.

Is it OK if they don't bother with collecting the old piece, what with carriage costs being expensive - Yes it is; I see a canoe mast there.

thanks Jeff and t'others.

Bill, buy in confidence but check it for knots anyway:0)

Yes, who could refuse "Sarah Suck Teeth" - she's got a way of putting things!

Bill.
