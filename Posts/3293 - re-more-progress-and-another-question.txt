I built a yuloh for my 14' lugger and mount it in a standard rowlock fitted to the transom. The loom is leathered where it fits into the rowlock and a leather 'button' comprising 3 layers of 3mm thick leather is screwed to the underside to stop the loom sliding through the rowlock. I had thought that this would need to be located against the aft face of the rowlock, to prevent the loom riding up through the rowlock in use. In practice, I find that it's best located against the forward face of the rowlock. The angle of the loom - pointing down and aft - is sufficient to prevent the anticipated 'riding up'. Indeed, the button is probably unnecessary. The system works perfectly. If you have access to 'Watercraft Magazine' you'll find a feature on it in the Nov/Dec  2005 issue.
