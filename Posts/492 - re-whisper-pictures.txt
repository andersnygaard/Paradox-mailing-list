Hi David,

I see you got the album for Whisper created, now just click on "add photo", then if you select "Single (with preview)" you will be able to give a description of the photo. It will take a few minuets to up load the photo from your computer if it is very large so I try to set the size on mine to 640 x 480 or 800 x 600 depending on the amount of detail you want to be available to the viewer. (you have to change the size of the photo on your computer and then store it in a file, again on your computer, where you can tell Yahoo groups to look for it).

If this is all confusing give me a call at home and I will walk you through it. We are all anxious to see how Whisper is progressing.

Tailwinds,
Glen
