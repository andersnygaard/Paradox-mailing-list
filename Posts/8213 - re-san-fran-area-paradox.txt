I posed the same question for owners but in the New York area a few weeks back. 
I agree, seeing one up close is helpful. 

Hi all - 

I found the Paradox design a few days ago, became entranced and immediately bought the plans. Just returned from the hardware store with balsa to build a model. 

I'm wondering if there are any Paradox, or other of Matt's designs, owners on the west coast. It would be great to see one in person and maybe even take a quick sail to whet the appetite. 

And, since the sailing weather is here, along with my tax return, if there's any up for sale, well, immediate gratification is always nice, too.... ;-) 

Cheers, 

Greg
