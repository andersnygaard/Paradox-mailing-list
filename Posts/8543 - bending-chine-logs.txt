Subject: Bending chine logs

Hi everyone,

Just wanted to let you know that the chine logs are now in place. I ended up leaving them sitting outside in the rain for a couple of days before bending them into place using clamps and a heat gun. The whole process went smoothly and they fit in perfectly. However, after letting them dry in place for about a week, I noticed that they had curved quite significantly. I have uploaded a photo of one of the chine logs in the album called Mini for you to see. Nevertheless, I was still able to take them out and glue them back in with ease.

My next step is to put on the bottom, but I wanted to ask about the tank and bilge dividers. The plans seem to suggest fitting them first, but I am unsure about whether to glue them in after the bottom is applied, or before. I am also concerned about how to apply glue to the bottom when the boat is upside down. Does anyone have any suggestions? The 3/4 inch ply really scares me!

One more thing, did you nail through the bottom into the bulkheads as well as the chine logs and transom or just rely on glue for the bulkheads and dividers?

Thanks in advance for your help!

Cheers,
Rob
