I built a simple frame. I could actually turn it over single handedly.

Hi all, I'm just about to fit the hull bottom. Increasing the weight of the boat so that its a 2 man job to turn it over it seems to me. Does anyone have any tips for turning the boat over such as straps, some kind of leverage etc. Thanks, Tony, Phuket, Thailand.
