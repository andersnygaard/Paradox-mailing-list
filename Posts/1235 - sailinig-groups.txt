Subject: Sailinig groups.

Hi Folks.

Just wondering what other groups most of you belong to.  I am 
currently subscribed to Microcruising, Selway Fisher, Bolger's 
groups, Paradox and Sailing Canoes.  My interest is in small sailing 
boats, 12 foot to 20 foot, that are good daysailers and capable of a 
fair turn of speed.  I have just received the plans for Dave 
Carnel's version of Bolger's Featherwind and will start construction 
as soon as the workshop is completed.  I am looking for other 
sailing groups to join.  

Thanks for your input.
Steve.
