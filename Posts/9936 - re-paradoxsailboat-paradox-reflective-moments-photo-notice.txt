Hello Erik,

Yes you may print the picture for your building area.
May I suggest you take a picture of the picture in your shop and post in this forum?
By the way, the paradox I'm sailing in the picture was built by Don Elliot.
It met Don's wife, Wanda Elliot and his son Josh when I purchased the boat.
So the inspiration is stronger knowing you have Don's book and a picture of his boat in your building. Enjoy.
Keep in touch,
Deric

Love the picture!
If you don=E2=80=99t mind I would love to print it out and hang it in the building area for inspiration.
just today I picked up the Elliot book printed at FedEx and had plans double sized for reference. Everything is coming together for a mid-January start on my build.

Hello Paradoxians,

As we near toward the end the 2022 sailing year, I take an opportunity to reflect and add a picture that reminds me of a wonderful memory the "Edge" provided me.

Please feel free to share a memory that occurred last year your paradox gave you. This portal may not be the flash that Facebook provides but the history in this site is gold. Information from year past are in this portal and it would be wonderful to keep the portal alive.

Below is a sail I took on Oneida Lake in Central New York, US. I was sailing and rockin n rollin.
