Ok,

I see the Sad comentary, and I understand it totally, we are basicly left to our own devices to decifer and apply the concept to build ourselves a boat, now, From the group here I have concluded this...

That the design is well thought out.. tried tested and true, quote, ITS DONE, complete. yada yada, not everybody but a few feel this way.

Now after looking over the plans, I can see the genius, brilliant...

But why why why does it show bent over nails???? they are bent over nails? right?

I wont even try to explain the reasons why not for fear of being called a troll, can anybody give a reason why?? when we can get the proper fasteners and do it right?? we are talking about the cabin. are they temporary clamping thats sacrificed in the production??
