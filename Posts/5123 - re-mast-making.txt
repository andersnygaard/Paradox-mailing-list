Hi Denny.

NOLI is basically the same size and layout as PARADOX..
I liked her looks and layout but wanted something that was a lot lighter that I could tow behind my 1.4 litre VW Golf.
When ENIGMA came off Matt's drawing board and her exploits started coming to our notice and with only a 6" draught, I knew that if I designed a PARADOX type and size, but with a 7" draught, I could get the weight down to about 1000 lbs. As it was, I managed to get it down with tweaking to 903 lbs.
I also wanted to build her as a stitch and glue construction project.
NOLI's finished size is 13' - 11" LOA by 3' - 11 1/2" beam.
NOLI's chine runners are slightly shorter but 1/2" wider with a concave upper surface.
The depth of her hull came from me wanting to get each hull side out of a sheet of 1/4" ply. As it was the hull panels and transom came out of two sheets and the bottom 3/8" out of one.
The storage under the cabin sole was dictated by the size of a 2 litre(Tesco basic) water bottle and the deck house by my sitting on the sole plus 1".
By not having the lower bins as fitted in PARADOX and making the width of the frame 3 uprights narrower, I have opened up the cabin and making it a more comfortable sailing position. Which I will leave Al and Bill to judge one day. You can also get an idea from some of my photo's in my folder.
In designing NOLI so light, by comparison, I was looking for more of a daysailer with overnight accommodation to sail in my local waters and surrounding area.
Mind you, ENIGMA seemed to have got on jolly well judging by some of the video's the "Chief" put up on his Watertribe site.
