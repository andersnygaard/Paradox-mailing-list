Sorry I didn't get any close ups nor any of the interior. Matt did say that if there was enough interest and the boat worked out as he wanted he might draw up plans for it. He doesn't want to release any plans for a boat that he hasn't personally built and sailed enough to know if it performs to his intentions. So far there has been lots of interest and he is pleased with its performance, so let's keep our fingers crossed. You can find more detail here: http://physics.bgsu.edu/~layden/FunStuff/Boats/Matt_Boat/matts_boat2005.htm. It is a website that his brother has set up and shows the complete building process.
