Thanks Jim,

the idea is to use steel hinges on the underside of the panels to get a rigid connection and a watertight flexible seal on top of the panel folding lines.
Simple elastic bands will be used on the inside to get a watertight sealing of the hatch when closed and the same system will be used on the outside,together with a lock system,to seal the hatch when the boat is left.
I figure that it will only be a matter of seconds to fully close or open the hatch with this system.
It's an alternative and not meant to replace the advantages of the sliding hatch.
