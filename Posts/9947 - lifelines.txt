Subject: Lifelines

Hello,

I recently finished building my Paradox sailboat and sailed it during fall of 2022. The sails worked great and I felt secure while in the boat. However, I am concerned about the safety aspect of being on deck. 

Has anyone installed lifelines or pulpits on their Paradox? I understand that being on deck might not be a regular thing, but it would be nice to have that safety measure in place just in case. Even when docking and loading onto the trailer, being on deck felt a bit risky. 

Thank you,
Kreig
