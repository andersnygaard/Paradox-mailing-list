Subject: Re: Hello .. with question about chine runners

Dear Paradox builders,

I would like to confirm that Paradox uses chine runners to reduce lateral movement through the water. They are aerodynamic "wings" located at the chines on both sides of the boat. They are made of wood and do not contain any ballast. 

In the words of Sven Yrvind: "I am now convinced that the chinerunner concept, created by Matt in 1982, is the greatest innovation for small cruising boats in the last century."

Also, I would like to include that Paradox carries its ballast internally with lead billets that can be removed or adjusted depending on stores carried. It has a relatively heavy displacement hull to get the chine runners immersed, and in a light displacement sharpie hull, they may not be as effective.

An alternative is the Michalak leeboard design for which you will have to join yet another group to find out more:-)
All of his designs are light displacement.

Best regards,
Nels
