Subject: Re: Starting a Paradox in Ithaca / pigment

Ithaca is in central New York, about two hours south of Lake Ontario. It is a beautiful part of the state -- when the glaciers retreated, they left gorges, waterfalls, and deep lakes all throughout the area. In August I'll move to the shore of Cayuga lake (still in Ithaca), which is 40 miles long and never wider than 4 miles. It is a bit out of the way, but if you ever find yourself in the northeast US Ithaca is a great place to visit. I'm up here for graduate studies in math(s) at Cornell, not in any particular rush to graduate and move away.

Good job with the boat and the Duckworks article, I've enjoyed watching the progress of your build!  One question: you used pigmented epoxy on the hull, right?  Does the pigment protect the epoxy from UV, or are you varnishing or painting it over as well? Those forest green Paradoxen sure are pretty... is there a reason behind all the green boats with red sails on that side of the pond?
