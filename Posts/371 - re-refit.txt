If you're going to grind off all the epoxy, I wonder if one of these moisture barrior coatings that are now available is worthwhile - or some of this penetrating epoxy i've heard/read about. I think I would use either of those for sure on new construction.

Ooo, where can I learn about these things?  

Are you the guy who's going to put kevlar on his bottom? 

No, I am.  Um, except that I'm not a guy. :-)

From what i've read, kevlar is a royal PITA to work with. It's supposedly really hard to properly wet-out, extremely hard to cut (i've heard of special scissors, knives etc. needed to work it), and basically can't be sanded at all.

I've heard basically the same thing -- but those properties are actually good, because they're a side effect of kevlar's unmatched abrasion resistance.  I'm guessing that the frequency with which a Paradox typically bumps the bottom in shallow water will make the extra effort pay off.  I might try a test layup on something small such as a Bolger Tortoise first, as a proof of concept.

(and the kevlar Paradox bottom is in part a proof of concept for using kevlar on the bottom of some future liveaboard boat)
