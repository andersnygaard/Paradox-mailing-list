Subject: Re: Building chine runners

Now that I think about it some more. I could have cut out the pine strips and glued and c clamped them in place, at that point when I traced out the template. Without the bottom in the way I could just use the c clamps to accomplish the bending. In other words make and mount the chine runners after the bottom edge of the sides and chines are planned down fair but before the bottom panel is put down.
