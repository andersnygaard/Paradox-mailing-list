Sorry to say I am not building a Paradox, or anything else at the moment yet. I'm presently drawing up a Bolger Micro for comparison though.

I thought I was going for the Paradox, but after seeing Jacks, the boat is either too small, or I'm too fat. 

Sofia is way to difficult to build at the moment, so it's down to an enlarged Paradox (or else go on a diet), Birdwatcher or Micro. I've been on the Birdwatcher that was in the recent Woodenboat magazine and there is plenty of room, although it does not have the capsize recovery of Paradox. Although I was thinking of hatches in the centerslot, as BWII is reported to have. Micro does not have the beachability of the other two due to it's 18 inch draft, so I was interested when someone else had mentioned they wanted to try chine runners on it. But they stuck to the plans.

So back to pouring over my Micro plans that someone had sent me from the microcruising newsgroup. Birdwatcher was the first boat I drew, and I should have micro done in a couple of weeks, so I'll have more side by side comparisons if anyone is interested.
