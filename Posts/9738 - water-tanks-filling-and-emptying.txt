Subject: Water Tanks - filling and emptying

Hello Paradoxians,

Interested in knowing how others perform filling and emptying the water bilge tanks.

This is how I have done it - two methods:

Method 1: I used a long 36 inch hand held pump to fill and to remove water from the tank. The disadvantage of this method is that too much water remains in the tank; requiring a smaller pump to transfer tank water into a bucket followed by a rag to remove remaining water. Filling the tank is easy with the long hand held pump.

Method 2: use a bilge pump (Rule) over the side of boat connected to the fill hoses to the tank as per original design. Filling tank is easy. In order to remove the water using the bilge pump I pull the boat out of the water and leave the boat on the trailer. Using a bucket filled with water on the side of the trailer on the ground I pump enough water using the bilge pump to push air out of hose and then remove the pump in order for the water to siphon out of the tank.

If you have a dox with the fill hoses as designed in the plans how do you fill and empty tanks? Looking for better ways.

Thank you,
Deric
