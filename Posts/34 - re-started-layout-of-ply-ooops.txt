Hi Al;

As I recall I didn't like the idea of a two piece bulkhead at station number two so I bought another sheet of 1/2" ply and was afforded the luxury of plenty of ply. Nothing wrong with cutting that bulkhead in two mind you just up set my yen and yang at the time. I believe if I was faced with your problem I would make a paper pattern of the side panel and then try to fit everything in. That way the ply edge is no longer important to the base line 

I'm prepping for paint now, actually laying out my non-skid pattern which of course requires all deck hardware positioning be firmed up. My non-skid will be walnut shells set in epoxy and then painted, once the paint has dried a grinder is run over the top of the non skid and leaves a very attractive finish which is kind on the feet, knees ect. when dry. Once water gets on it the wood swells up extending above the paint and gives a very firm surface. I will take some pictures of the process and post them. The bottom is now painted so I no longer have to turn her on her side to work on it. I'm still struggling with the anchor stowage. I have a problem stowing it below because so many times I have pulled up a smelly anchor and the thought of putting one below tends to roll my stomach. As it stands now I will probably go as designed and see if it is really a problem. Must not have been for Matt as he lived aboard for so long, if it had been much of a problem I think he would have catted it out on the bow.

Back to work
