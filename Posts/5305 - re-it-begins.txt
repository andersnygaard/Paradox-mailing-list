Rodney,

As others have said, good luck with your build. Your schedule will be 
demanding, but if you can work almost full time on the boat i'd say 
achievable (but there's more to this boat than meets the eye).
Jimmy Lu built his "Auspice" 
http://tw.myblog.yahoo.com/fi156-storch/
in a very short time earlier this year, I think less than 8 months, and 
I have no doubt it could be done quicker.

I myself have been at mine for 16 months and still have a lot more to 
do. I can go for weeks doing nothing as the demands of my wife and kids 
come first! I could build faster, but I always envisaged this to be my 
retirement boat, and that won't be for at least 10 years yet. I hope 
it's finished by then!

I understand why you just want to get on and build. This is my first 
build also and I had no desire to build something first as an 
apprenticeship. I just learn as I go and so far have had nothing that 
has stumped me completely. I windsurf when there's enough wind, and I 
can sail with others when I have the time, so I have no desire for 
anything other than my Paradox at the moment.

One of the most useful things I've found is the photo's posted by other 
builders. Obviously I'm sure you've checked out the photos on this 
group and at http://groups.yahoo.com/group/paradoxbuilders2 but also 
extremely useful are the following:

Bill's Faith http://www.paradox-uk.co.uk/
Jimmy's Auspice http://tw.myblog.yahoo.com/fi156-storch/
Alberto's Cachivache http://www.derawson.com.ar/fotos.htm

Anyway good luck and keep us appraised of your progress and keep asking 
questions.
I'm off now to get ready to hopefully fit my foredeck tomorrow.

Cheers

When people ask I usually say it will take about 18 months, that's 
going by what others have done. If you are really trying for a launch 
in the New Year then you have solved one problem - forget about the 
PDR or anything else, you won't have any time to go sailing.

Hoping for calm nights
