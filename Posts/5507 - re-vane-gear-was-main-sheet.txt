Hi Glen and everyone,

I am making great progress with my vane. In fact, I am working on two models - an upside down and a conventional to test which works best. For the Walt Murray inspired USD system, I am wondering whether you used to 5" X 32" X 9" dimensions specified on his site. I read somewhere that you were having problems with light air performance and am wondering whether to make allowance for a larger vane. Perhaps it would be a good idea to be able to switch back and forwards between a larger and a smaller vane depending on wind conditions?

What are your thoughts on this issue?

Thanks,

Mark
