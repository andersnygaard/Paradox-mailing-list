Subject: Re: ballast

Great advice thank you
I was wondering if I was missing something
Seems my experience is nothing unusual

I'm tempted to mess things up and got a Bermuda rig just to see what would happen
A triangular main and a jib

For the moment though I'm going to sail as much as I can in warm climes
Happy sailing
Nick
