Are you thinking of Christchurch? Chichester has lots of mud at low water, but there is still plenty of water in the channels.

Milford is a good choice. My personal choice would be Poole. I like it because, though it has lots of quiet corners, it also has fairly large areas of water so you can try sailing on all points without being restricted by the channels and, of course, the tides are very accommodating.

Hoping for calm nights
