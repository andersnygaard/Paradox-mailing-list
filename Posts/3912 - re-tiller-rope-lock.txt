I made 2 disks about 3" diameter, fastened one to the head of a bolt and the other to a nut. Screwed the 'nut' disc to the underside of the side deck by the tiller rope and fitted the 'bolt' disc. The rope is placed between the discs and is clamped by screwing up the 'bolt' disc.

Hoping for calm nights
