Hi Al.

Its all down to the weather.
My first job is to paint the hull in epoxy high-build prior to the final paint job.
I have been quite busy lately with a lot of unwanted drawing work coming in, but still it helps pay the bill's and for the sail which is on order with a sailmaker in Cowes.
Just think that this time last year we were walking around in tee shirts and shorts.
Today.
Bloody hailstones and cold.
Still. I have bought the Perspex for the side and rear windows as "offcuts" which cost me =A36.
They are looking out for a nice bit for the front.
I am still looking to put NOLI in the water late June, early July.
Lets hope the weather sorts itself out soon.
