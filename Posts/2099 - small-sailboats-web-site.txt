Subject: Small Sailboats web site

I am having problems with the new web space for the Small Sailboats web site.

Therefore, until the problem is resolved please do not use the domain name http://www.smallsailboats.co.uk. Instead, use the old address: http://www.btinternet.com/~w.serjeant.

Thank you.

Bill.
