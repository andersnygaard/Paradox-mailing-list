I don't think I have ever heard of a trailer sailor who felt the mast of his sailboat had to be completely inside the boat. I have trailered boats thousands of miles and never gave a thought to the mast, except to have a red flag hooked onto the end and make certain it was protected from abrasion.

Are people getting this paranoid these days?
