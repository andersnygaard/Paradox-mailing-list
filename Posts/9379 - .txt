Subject: Paradox weight

Hi A.S.,

I believe 1410 is the weight of the finished Paradox including water and lead ballast. When in cruising mode, if you are carrying cans of food, for example, you can then reduce the lead ballast by the equivalent weight. Until you eat them of course, so I don't count them. Which means when cruising long distance, my boat usually weighs in at 1600 lbs or so.

Sailing season just around the corner here in Québec Canada! Still ice on the lakes…
