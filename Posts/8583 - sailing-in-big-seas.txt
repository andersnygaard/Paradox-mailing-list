Hello all

Took my Paradox out in strong winds, 25 kts gusting more.
Short chop 5 foot high and close spaced waves, just 15 to 20 feet apart
The boat was stable enough but would not go to wind in these awful confused seas
I tacked for hours and made no real headway? Sailed 9 am till 5 pm.
I'm talking to the sailmaker tomorrow and getting a few small changes done to the sail
(I have the mark2 sail type, not the original on the plan)
Maybe I'll get a little closer to the wind then?
Furling the sail in heavy weather was a bummer
I'm going to ditch the boom and make a round one.
The edges of the boom caught on everything imaginable, the square shape makes it stutter and grab, unless it's smooth seas, it seems?
A round boom and a bigger thimble on the end are a must for me.

The motor I was so pleased with last week, BROKE.
I'm talking to the agent tomorrow and will report back more.
But taking a motor with plastic bits to sea might be fatal? I'm going back to my stinky petrol all-metal Honda 2.3 air cooled.
I'll check to see if it's operator error before elaborating on the disaster that was this motor today.
3000 Aust dollars, twice the petrol motor cost, and one rough day ruined it!

So I suffered the indignity of being towed by the Coast Guard into port.
I'm too much a novice to sail into dock, I radioed and got a tow, as the motor was kaput!
Twisted and snapped parts? From a renowned manufacturer, I'm confused and feel a bit let down.
Pity, it was so good in the calm seas I first launched into last week.
:(

More to follow.

So sailing adventure number two, a big day out.
Lots of lessons learned I hope?
More time in the workshop now before setting out again and a few days for the bruises to settle.

Hope others are sailing away.
