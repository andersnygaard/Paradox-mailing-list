Hi Dave,

Thank you very much! That is what I have been looking for.

I do have two questions:

1. Is the metal rod that goes into the center of the roller/boom secured inside in some manner?

The plans call for a groove in the rod with a screw into it through the boom. In practice it doesn't seem to need it.

2. From the photos it appears that the "standpipe" enters the top of the cabin. Is this true, and if so, how is the standpipe attached inside the cabin?

The "standpipe" terminates at deck level (resting on the deck, so bevel the end and fit some sort of wear pad) but has a rope through it's centre which goes through a hole in the deck and is cleated off underneath. This gives a cheep but effective universal joint.

Hoping for calm nights
