Subject: Mast Up

Hi,

Are we all away sailing? Very quiet around the sites.

See Photos/Enuf for a new picture of the mast in position. Still got to finish it but it is the right shape now. I've even managed to rotate the pic so that you don't need to turn your screen through 90 degrees.

Thank you!
