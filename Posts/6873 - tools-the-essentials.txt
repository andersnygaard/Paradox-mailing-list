Hello Guys,

I am busy kitting out my garage with tools, etc for the build. I would like to start after our rain season, since I discovered that with our high humidity during winter, a normal coat of paint takes 2 days to dry, not good. So for that reason, I will only start in spring.

But while I am kitting out my garage, I need some advice on what tools are essential for the build, so I can get them so long and be ready when spring comes. I am not talking about clamps, since I know one needs 1 million and 1 of those and then it is still not enough. I am referring more to the power tools and other manual tools to do the job of cutting, shaping, and sanding.

Thanks,

smilicus
