Subject: Re: An unexpected benefit of the sprit rig - self steering

I haven't done anything about it yet, but I'm thinking about adding trim tab self steering with a vertical wind vane... make the thing as simple as I possibly can!

I take it you've seen the self steering gear that Glen Maxwell fitted to Zoe?
