I was part of a forum for the Windrider Rave, hydrofoil trimaran, and the portal shut down. It hurts when the historical records are no longer available. Such wealth of information no longer accessible.
The only way is for our group is to take ownership. That will cost in terms of time and support and hardware and possible subscription for domain etc..
I would be willing to contribute money but do not have the skills to create a solution.

I've got a small Yahoo group that I'm the owner of. I've just looked into what's possible and the news is not good. You can request a download, but they will only give you what you posted personally, so it looks like there is no way of recovering the entire email archive. This is the problem with these corporate solutions, you end up being screwed over by them sooner or later! If we move to Facebook, the same thing will happen again. That's why Eerik's idea of an open source solution that someone is prepared to host is the only viable one in the long term.
