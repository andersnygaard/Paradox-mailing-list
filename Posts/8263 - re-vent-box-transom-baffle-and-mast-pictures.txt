Obviously, Paradox is not going to match 25 ft multi's and 30 ft mono's, but I wonder how she would have done vs the other competitors who are still out there now? Paradox is designed to be sailed continuously - that's how she won the Everglades Challenge and I have noticed that even the larger boats' average speeds have been in the 3 knot range, despite short spurts in the early teens.

So..., if a Paradox skipper could keep going in relative comfort, both at night and during the day, only stopping for a few hours rest every couple of days, I wonder where they would be on the tracker by now?

Many of the teams that remain are in MUCH lighter boats than a Paradox, which would have struggled to go to weather in anything beyond 15 knots, but surely a Paradox would go to weather in anything up to 25 knots. It better be able to, because we often have winds that strong down here in NZ and I'm assuming it's capable of going to weather in that kind of breeze!
