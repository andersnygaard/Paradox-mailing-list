If you are serious about building then Dons 'how to build' articles are almost an essential.

The essential tools are quite modest. The ones I use most are a battery drill/screwdriver and a jigsaw. Oh yes, and a hammer!

I would class my skills not so much as woodworker more as bodger. But even I have found it difficult to mess up.

The construction process is such that there is always a trial fit before the glue is added, so cock-ups are not fatal.

Apart from moving full sized sheets of ply, and turning the hull over in the confines of a garage (cunning use of roller skates) I have managed the whole assembly single handed. See www.asjg.clara.co.uk/little_jim/little_jim.htm for the results so far.
