Subject: New Paradox Odyssey is launched
To: paradoxbuilders@yahoogroups.com

Hello folks,

This is CrazyRussian from Watertribe. A friend of mine, Aleksander Fadeev, who is also a member of this group, has launched his beautiful boat last week. He is currently exploring New York Long Island coast after sailing the boat from Barnegat Bay, NJ, his home base.

Last week, he stopped by my mooring field on Staten Island, NY where we spent all weekend fixing, trying to break and generally shake up the boat as much as we can while learning her. I shot a few videos, which you may find interesting.

Isn't she beautiful? Have you seen the Paradox with teak deck yet? :)

I hope Alexander will let you know his feelings and observations at the end of his trip, he is overwhelmed with the new experience.

Wish him fair winds.
