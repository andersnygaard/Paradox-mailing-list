Subject: Re: The Classic Paradox Boat "Zoe" Destroyed in Transport

I have only submitted the plans to a single builder, I am waiting to see if the transport company's insurance will actually pay for a full value replacement (I suspect they won't). But I do expect a quote/estimate from the builder today or tomorrow and will post the results here.

Hi Mark,

Have you received any quotes from other builders yet?  I'm very curious to hear how much a professional builder would charge...

Thanks,
