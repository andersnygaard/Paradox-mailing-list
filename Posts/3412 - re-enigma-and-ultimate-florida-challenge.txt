Hi Dave.

I sure hope so. I would buy a set.
This boat is amazing. If you look at the latest video the film shows that 
the chine runners really work by the way she goes to windward.

This little boat seems to stand up to quite a bit of wind and sea.
We will have to ask Dave and Mindy about Matts plans for Enigma when they 
get back from their cruise.
