Well, I meant the rig would be simpler. 

But a birdsmouth mast is really pretty easy to build if you have a table saw. 
It doesn't need to be round, either. You can make an oblong one by making two 
opposite staves wider than the rest.

8 staves 15mm x 30mm will yield nearly the right size for the boom

There's a good website that shows the method :

but the formula is simple:

stave width =3D (desired diameter)/2.5
stave thickness =3D (desired diameter)/ 5

tapering is a little harder, but not much. Reducing the stave width   by 1/8 
the difference in circumference is close enough. final planing and sanding 
takes care of the rest. the resulting spar is very light, but for a boom, I'd 
make the stave thickness as much as 20% thinner and leave the boom mostly 
octogonal. the spar,however will be as much smaller as you reduce the stave 
thickness, so don't forget to add that to the desired diameter.

the hardest part   for me was the plugs at the ends for fittings. It took 
quite a bit of trial and error to get them right. Fittng 8 sides at once isn't 
easy. I amost resorted to sawing the mast I did lengthwise and glueing it back 
together after fitting half-plugs, but after a couple of tries, patience won 
out.
