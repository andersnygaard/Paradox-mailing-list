Again, this adding amidships is a common practice with dorys and their cousins the sharpies.

Bolger designed a longer version of his Micro, by just adding 4 ft of length amidships on the same beam. (15.5 ft vs 19.5 ft.)

Since it is faster, it "seems" to have less leeway since the forward speed means there is less "time" for it to be driven downwind over any given distance.

Also the added displacement allows it to carry considerably more sail than the Micro, adding even more speed potential.

It ended up that even Bolger was impressed!
