Subject: Re: Wood Stove Idea for Paradox

Yes that's true, no insulation in my boat. But not sure it would make much real difference. The biggest heat loss must be due to the flow of air through the ventilation ports . I've made a cover from some old rubber sheet which plugs the tiller hole. I just remove the round cover in the transom if it's too hot and I need the ventilation.

I stuff a towel in the vent box to control the flow.

I tend to get condensation under the hatch window overnight, after the heating stove has gone out, which drips on my head while I'm laying in bed, whether I have the vents open or closed.  Not so good. I may try and devise some insulation just for there.

I too sometimes get condensation on the windows. It doesn't usually start to drip until the morning, when I should be getting up anyway.

Have you tried sleeping head towards the bow? Problem solved!
