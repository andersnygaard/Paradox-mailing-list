Thanks...

I am talking to someone about building a paradox for me (he is doing it for a very reasonable cost). However, i have always had the impression that Enigma is better into the wind...of course paradox has many other advantages. Wish i could own both....

Mark 

I'm not sure of full story regarding the specs. But 
it works and looks exactly like the Enigma Matt built. 

They appear to be the real deal. 

Let me know how you go. 

Enjoy

Yes i would be interested. Perhaps you can upload to files section  or email them. Are they the actual specs for enigma or a speculative  look-alike? it was never clear to me if they were the real deal.

Subject: [paradoxbuilders]  Building an Enigma


I have built an Enigma to hull and deck stage. There used to be a Yahoo  group called Enigma Builders.

There were no plans but there was a set of dxf files with a layout of the hull dimensions and bulkheads.

By importing the dxf files into a Cad program I was then able to work out the measurements for the hull and transpose onto plywood.

From there I built the hull, bulkheads, cockpit and deck.

There were also online photo's of Matt building his Enigma which were referenced a lot for building mine.

For the rest of it I was going to use the Paradox plans to work out mast, sail, steering, rudder, etc.

Also, I was waiting for Matt to put out the plans. But that never happened and I never got around to completing mine.

The Enigma group no longer exists in Yahoo. But I do have the dxf files if anyone is interested.

Cheers

Gary
