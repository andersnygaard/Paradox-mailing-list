Greetings All,

Thank You for ll the feedback on "Epoxy". I have a lot more Labor into My Paradox than Money, I want to do whats best to preserve what I have done and that means I will definately use Epoxy.

The Strip Planks shoudn't move around much if any, any wood to wood contact is glued and where possible ring nails or Deck screws are used. {Iknow that it doesn't take much to crack Polyester}

The deck and Cabin "Might" be a little heavy but hopefully not enough to affect balance.

I don't plan on putting in the "Water Tank" so I will have to compensate for that missing Ballast too. {If I do put the tank in it will be a smaller version} I'm going to the Local RV Dealer and see what He has in His Junk Pile, maybe I can find something suitable for the purpose.

Maybe I should start out with 300 to 400 lbs of Ballast??

{Hey...I could turn the Boat over and put a 1/2" of "Ferrocement" over it..................HMMMMMM.}

Thank You again,
Dave Blow
