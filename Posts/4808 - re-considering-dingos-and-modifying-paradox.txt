Subject: Re: Considering Dingos and Modifying Paradox

A 10% increase would build a boat about the size of little cruiser in length and width. The original paradox has alot of appeal in its small size but the extra room of the larger version would be real nice. Can someone with paradox pics online, tell me their height and weight. I am 6'4" and 270# so the extra room inside would be really nice.
