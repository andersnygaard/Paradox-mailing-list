Dave, No Kevlar for me. I think the ply got damp from rain water sitting on the inside, There was little water there when i bought it. The hatch had a leak. Thanks for the info.

Depending on how wet the ply is, you should allow up to several WEEKS for it
to _really_ get dry. A shortcut is to use a heat lamp for a week or so. I
would also do what I could to see if there's a void in the plywood in any
suspect areas that might be attracting/holding liquid. I have heard that by
tapping, one can sometimes hear a difference (even when filled with liquid)
and that voids will show up on a hull when it's covered with dew due to
differences in heating/cooling.

If you're going to grind off all the epoxy, I wonder if one of these
moisture barrior coatings that are now available is worthwhile - or some of
this penetrating epoxy i've heard/read about. I think I would use either of
those for sure on new construction.

Are you the guy who's going to put kevlar on his bottom? I'm interested to
hear how that goes. From what i've read, kevlar is a royal PITA to work
with. It's supposedly really hard to properly wet-out, extremely hard to cut
(i've heard of special scissors, knives etc. needed to work it), and
basically can't be sanded at all.
