Subject: Re: Hatch/Roof Option - Peep Hen

Hi Glen,

I appreciate your perspective and experience. I really like the pics 
on your website and photos here. You did a professional looking job 
on your Paradox.

I did a search on the Internet for Peep Hen's. They seem to be few 
and far between, having been out of production for some time. Used 
ones seemed to sell rather quickly and I can see why they would be 
sought after.

Failing the readily availability of Peep Hens, especially in my area, 
I looked for some plans of boats with some of its features - there 
are not many, but here are a couple.

I think I still like the Paradox for this part of the world, where 
even summers are cool most of the time and people usually wear warm 
clothes to go boating (Whitehorse, Yukon, and Skagway, Alaska). I 
also expect to be sailing alone "80%" of the time too.
