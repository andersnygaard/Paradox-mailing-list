thanks Nels
I've just read the first three chapters. Fascinating stuff. I can never quite get to grips with the sheer scale of North America. I'm just reading a book about Lewis and Clark; even the lengths of the rivers are awesome.
I take back anything I might have suggested about potable water in your great continent while on another group:0)

While I'm here what is the relationship, if any, between the displacement of a hull and its load carrying capacity?
I've seen a canoe for sale that has a displacement of 130lb. I know that my camping kit and I weigh nearly 300lb. Is the one affected by the other?
Cheers
