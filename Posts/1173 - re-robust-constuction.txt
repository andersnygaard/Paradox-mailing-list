Hi DC.

I sometimes wonder what type of sailing some members want to do or what their sailing skills are like. It would seem they want to go out sailing, and hit something without worrying about damage to themselves.

Shane Acton's SHRIMPY was an old boat, built here on the Island when he first set off around the world. At 18' 6" OA she had a skin thickness of 5/16" PAINTED! and No glass coating. A friend had a larger version at 21' by the same designer, which had a skin thickness of 3/8" painted.

To my mind PARADOX at 13' 10" is overbuilt, the bottom at 1" is OK for knocking chunks out of coral reefs but the sides at 3/8" would be more than adequate and make life a little easier during construction.

The main thing when building any boat is to buy the best ply you can afford, not because exterior is cheaper. The difference in total cost on the finished boat between exterior ply and a good mid range marine plywood is not worth thinking about when it comes to the service life, finish and resale value of your project.
