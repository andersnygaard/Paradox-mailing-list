Subject: Re: Chine runner efficiency.

I can't find anything on the Internet about the cat design to compare. I saw it once awhile ago. It was two dory type hulls.

Also I can't make out the details on the file to see how the chine runners are shaped. Seems like the bottom is completely straight from bow to stern? And fairly wide and long chine runners? Makes me wonder how well the boat would turn and come about. Also there is no indication of the rig size. Is that a long bowsprit I see? 

I certainly thought that T Lee might like it:-)

Here is a link to a shorter camping version of a Jeff Gilbert cat. I haven't actually read the entire article as I am not interested in catamarans. Some people might be though.

If the link doesn't work, just do a search with Jeff Gilbert and Hot chili.
