Subject: Wood for Boat Question and opinions

Hello Paradox People,

I spoke to a lumber place about Douglas Fir because I would like to order the wood and start a build. They thought DF for a boat was not a good choice and mentioned vertical grain Douglas Fir if I were to insist to us DF, and then they mentioned Hem Fir as an alternative, --- they said it was "green wood" and very plentiful; that it was basically the same thing as DF.

Of course, you may notice that I am a novice as the nature of my questions:

What do you folks think about Hem Fir as a choice of wood? (I would think green wood is not the way to go)

What can you share about vertical DF? Did you get into such specifics when purchasing wood?

In Central New York, USA, it is not easy to find a lumber place that can supply the materials. DF is more difficult to get than I would have ever thought.

Lastly, I would welcome any Lumber company that you could recommend that could supply the type of wood used to build the Paradox.

Matt was happy enough with DF, but I did not note if it was vertical DF or not.

Much Obliged,

Deric
