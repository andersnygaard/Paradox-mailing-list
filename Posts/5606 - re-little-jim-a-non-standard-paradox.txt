Subject: Re: Little Jim, a non-standard Paradox

Not sure how a vertical oar would work (isn't that a rudder?)

But remember speed isn't the only parameter, energy efficiency is important. I only drive my Paradox at about 2 knots (If I try to go faster I quickly become exhausted) but I can do that all day.

Hoping for calm nights
