Hi Folks,

Thanks for letting me join your group. Many years ago (in the 1970's) I built here in the South of England a 24 foot gaff cutter to a standard design. I lived on board for a couple of years and sailed her in the English Channel and the the North Atlantic for most of that time.

I learnt this experiance that this traditional type of boat has lots of short comings. I found my boat too tender to really stand up to much wind and very slow out in the open sea.

In 1974 I gave up sailing after being wrecked in the Canary Islands and have never saile since! I have since then been pre-occupied with working hard and building up a business and then became interested in microlight flying, so there has been no time to get sailing again. 

But, retirement is looming and I hope to have more time for doing what I would like to do and I very much hope to be able to build myself a small boat again.

This time round I would not go for a traditional boat again and find the more radical small boat designs very interesting. Generally here in England the sharpie type is not used and I wonder why?

I shall be mainly lurking on your Group to see what the Paradox is all about and hope to learn from you people if that's OK with you. Thanks for having me along.
