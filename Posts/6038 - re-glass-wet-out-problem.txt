Subject: Re: Glass wet-out problem

You puzzle me. I always use a paint brush to apply and smooth out when applying epoxy over cloth. I apply a liberal amount of resin and keep moving it all over evenly allowing a fair amount of time for it to soak in. If you use a squeegee, are you not removing the resin from the cloth matrix and making it lean? And why massive pressure? Would that not also remove the resin? I'm always generous with the amount of resin and avoid any pressure or straining. I just wait for the absorbing to take place. Then, right after that, move any excess resin to some neighboring ares which needs more. I learned this from watching my Dad who did this for a living back in the 50's and 60's when lots of boats were plywood and fiberglass. He was the head painter at "Built Right Boats" in Santa Monica Calif. He did use a squeegee sometimes but was useing a gentle pressure. They were using only polyester resin then so you had to move fast as the resin would harden quickly on a warm day. Say! did your resin harden too quickly? It may be that it got too stiff to soak in anymore. What was the temperature when you did you earlier fiberglassing compared to the current episode? Cooler temperatures allow a good long time for the glass cloth to absorb befor hardening occures.

I rolled my hull over onto it's side to fiberglass the sides. So I was always working downward. It minimizes drips and runs.
