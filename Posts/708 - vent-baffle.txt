Is the vent baffle opening in the transom necessary?  If you steer using the tiller ropes, the ropes could be lead into the cabin through drip boxes, so there is no need for the vent baffle.  A dorade box or two could provide ventilation.

It is nice to have a real tiller within reach of the helm seat.  It just seems that this is a big opening in the boat, and if there is a way around having a vent baffle, I would like to eliminate it.
