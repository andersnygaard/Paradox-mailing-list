Thanks man, early on I downloaded all the files and photos into a Paradox folder on my pc.
I am thinking of a wind vane also. Do you know if the plans in the files section for one are completed yet?

Rod,

Steve has answered the first part of your question re the original config.
Glen has modified his sheet routing, not for an engine, but to 
prevent fouling on his wind vane steering gear. However the lead for 
the sheet seems much more sensible than the original, especially if 
you intend to mount an engine. I will be routing my sheet exactly as 
Glen has.
If you look at this photo http://www.smallsai lboats.co. uk/cd/faith. JPG
I think you'll agree that Glen's sheeting would make more sense?

There is a picture in the files section 
http://tinyurl. com/64lt9h
if the above doesn't work it is in the folder called Zoe's Vane gear. 
It is image IMG_2282.jpg with the following comment:
"New main sheet location. There is a turning block located under the 
deck. Any water entering here will drip into the baffle below and out 
the tiller thru hull hole."

Glen has also documented the topping lift arrangement mentioned 
earlier. Again there are lots of photos in the file section in the 
folder called Topping Lift http://tinyurl. com/5pc48x

Hope that helps
