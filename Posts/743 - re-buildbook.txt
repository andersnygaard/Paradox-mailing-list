I read this in the plans but was too lazy to write it correctly.  

Question: the sheer clamp notches should get the horizontal cut only,
not the complete notch.  Can the chine log notches be cut completely?
 Or should only the horizontal cut be made?

Finally started with some woodworking.  I am building my deck beam
mold and intend to laminate my deck beams out of 1/4" plywood.
