Subject: re plywood

Hi again Jim

Im no expert on this subject,but I often wonder who is,because you tend to hear a lot of comflicting opinions.

Firstly resale-if you build a ply boat from scratch you will be lucky to recover the cost of the materials.There doesnt seem to be much dispute about this.So, if you are going to build something that will take hundreds of hours of your time and cost hundreds or thousands in materials you had better

1:Have a good idea the boat you build is going to be the one you really want.

2:Want to build a boat,have or be prepared to develop, the skills required to do a good job.You mention that you have already build a 23 footer so presumably you have these skills and know what sort of task you are commiting yourself to.Judging by what one reads on the net,plenty of people seem to enjoy building as much,if not more,than using.Nothing wrong with that of course.

Little Cruiser and Swamp thing were built before epoxy resin was in widespead use.Epoxy is miles better than polyester in its ability to bond.The enemy of plywood is moisture,especially if it grts into the wood between the waterproof glue lines where it cannot escape.The end grain needs particular attention,and its maintainence must be kept upto.Unfortunately it is very difficult to dry ply out,so one tends to seal moisture in if any loss of coating has occured.I wonder if other readers have any tips on this?

Another school of thought is not to encasulate any wood-in effect let it breathe.

Remember LC and ST are around 20years old and have seen plenty of use.Swamp thing has had several owners and has lived all its life outside in the tropics.

If you want to see the used values of various boats check the magazines or Ebay.Few boats seem to sell easily-ther is a saying that the 2 best days of boatownership are the day you buy and the day you sell!Every boatyard in Britain seems to have an old ply Silhouette or similar rotting away in the brambles at the back.Such boats are worthless nad some are beyond economic repair.Some are in much better condition than they appear and can be rewnovated quite cheaply-if you dont cost your time.

Were you to build a paradox you would have a boat with a tiny secondhand market BUT very little,if any competition!Maybe you would buck conventioal wisdom,but I wouldnt count on it.

Cheers
Neil
