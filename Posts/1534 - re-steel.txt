Bill,  

I just picked up your book, "A Speck On The Sea" looks like a good read so far.

You could carry a small oxy/acetylene kit (the size of those small propane
tanks).  .10" steel would heat up fast enough to be gas welded if away from
electricity.

Also like Bill has said about the advantages of steel is speed, also
the finish is very fast, prime and paint. spray on foam to stop
condensation, add boyancy and add insulating. one drawback would be
remote repair, epoxy could patch it up till you get to a welder I
guess, carry a few bolts and washers for fast patch.
