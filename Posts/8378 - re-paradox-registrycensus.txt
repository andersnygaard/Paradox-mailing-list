Interesting.

So how does he control leeway? Leeboards, perhaps; although there are no signs. Centreboard?

I've recently (last week or so) met Richard, who now owns Minnow. He really enjoys sailing her on the river, but says that she won't tack and needs to be helped around with the curved sculling oar. I wonder if this is because chine runners behave rather like a long keel?
From a slightly different angle, catamarans (the kind with two hulls) are often reluctant to tack. Yet Ray Aldridge has managed, by arranging a high aspect ratio dagger board, to get his Slider to tack.
Of course, one wouldn't dream of putting a dagger board on a Paradox, but high a/r leeboards? Might be very appropriate on a tiny barge yacht!

Best wishes,

John
