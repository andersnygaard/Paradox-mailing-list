Hi Jack.

Clench nails are really good fasteners, though by all outward appearances, they do resemble the bent over surplus of a hack wood butcher. They are really quite effective. My dad has a wonderful old cedar/canvas Oldtown canoe built in 190X, which is clench nailed. Many canoes and lapstrake vessels have been built with clench nails.

How would you feel more comfortable? You are certainly free to do whatever you wish. There are any number of methods to utilize to achieve an admirable end. As you suggested, you could use flathead machine screws and nuts, or you could use rivets and roves, etc...

The benefits of using the clench nails is that the structure is joined with adhesives and fasteners, and the clench nails are inexpensive and simple. Clench nails finish flush on both sides, and a light filler of epoxy and microballoons (or take your pick) will effectively fair the surface, obviating the need for time consuming trim. Several resources are out there which describe the various methods of fastening. Among them, "Gougeon Brothers on Boat Construction", and Robert Steward's "Boatbuilding Manual" are quite useful.

If you feel that you can spend the money for wood instead of plywood, and the time necessary to laminate and/or spile these parts, you could fasten from below, with flathead wood screws, or even just put your full faith in your quality epoxy. The Gougeon Brothers' book details some of the useful means of joinery with epoxy and epoxy/fasteners.

Other folks may have broached this and other questions that you have. You might give a search through the archives, which I have found to be a valuable resource just as the photos and files.

Have fun.
