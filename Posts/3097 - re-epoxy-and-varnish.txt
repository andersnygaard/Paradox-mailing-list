Subject: Re: Epoxy and Varnish

Based on personal experience, knots do indeed cause weakness in wood spars, but surprisingly it is not the knot itself, but rather the fact that the normal 'straight grain' of the wood swerves around the knot and has 'grain runout' in the vicinity of the knot.

In my opinion, wood grain runout can be viewed similar to a scarf joint. If the runout of the grain is more than 8:1 or so, the wood piece could be improved by cutting out the section and replacing it with a 8:1 scarf.

In short, filling the knot with epoxy would do nothing to fix the grain runout.

In an emergency, I might be tempted to wrap the spar with fiberglass and epoxy on the section with excessive grain runout near the knot. [Just my opinion.]
