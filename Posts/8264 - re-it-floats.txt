Hi Alastair,

I will sail it off the Yorke Peninsular in South Australia. But first I must come to terms with the Yuloh. I'm not getting the knack of it, although I can go backwards using it quite well? More practice I guess. Then to sail to, then around Wardang Island, 12 km off shore. Should be exciting and educational. More pics to come when we're at sea.
