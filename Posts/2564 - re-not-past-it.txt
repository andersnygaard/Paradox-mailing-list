Hi Kjell.

Great idea to build in foam.
Are you using Polyester or epoxy in the layup.
What do you plan to make the Chine runners from and how will you fix them.
About 15 years ago I built a 16 foot airboat with a friend out of Airex R63 for the bottom and Herex C70 for the topsides and structure.
We used Polyester resin in the layup.
That thing was bullet proof, well nearly.
We use to drive it over a shingle bank flat out. All it did was take the paint off the bottom.
I have always thought this would be an ideal material to build a PARADOX from.
