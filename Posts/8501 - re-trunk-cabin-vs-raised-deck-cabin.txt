Subject: Re: Trunk Cabin vs Raised Deck Cabin

The side decks are essential for going forward onto the foredeck.
The fore deck is my favourite place to lounge at anchor when the weather is fine.

I rarely helm from down below so visibility through the windows isn't much of an issue.
If you're going to install the side bins, keeping the doghouse as per plan is the obvious answer.

The Enigma 460 took the doghouse right to the gunnels at the stern, but had a fully removable hatch cover to allow access forward.
It doesn't look half as nice or convenient as Paradox.

There's a good reason Matt still has Paradox!
