Subject: Re: Chine logs and Sheerstrakes again!

Hi Derek,

The chine logs on my micro are mahogany, but not sure which kind. My gut feeling would be to go with the one that best takes fasteners without splitting. If the two are equal in that regard then the cheaper one is probably more than adequate.

Cheers, Nels
