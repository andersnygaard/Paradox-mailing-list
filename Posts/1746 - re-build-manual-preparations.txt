Like Al I started with basics, But would like to add one more tool, a 6" orbital sander, great for aggressive sanding.

To all. I've scrutinized the suggested tools list due to Al and David's suggestions of excess. I readily agree that the boat can be built without the need for stationary power tools.

What specific tools do you feel to be unnecessary? I don't feel that a minimal tools list would serve each member, though if there is a consensus regarding the unnecessary inclusion of a specific tool or tools, we can remove it from the list.
