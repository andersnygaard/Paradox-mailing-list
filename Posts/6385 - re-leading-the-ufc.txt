Subject: Re: ???...... Leading the UFC

See <http://www.watertribe.com/> Dave Bolduc sailed Enigma in the Everglades Challenge under the name of Freebyrd, Matt is leading the Ultimate Florida Challenge in Illusion under the name of Wizard.


Okay I don't know really, can you tell me where everyone is watching this? Is it online somewhere? Or must the observers watch there in person? Watching some would be far more fun than reading about it  

Is there a site listing the entries and the specs of each boat?

Matt Layden has never been a prolific writer about his boats. The sum-total about his "chine runners" can be narrowed down to one or two articles. I sure wish there were more.

Thanks,

Andrew
