If you as moderator didn't empty the folder and I don't remember doing it,
it may have been 
an act of God. On the other hand, I do lots of things that i don't remember
shortly after but 
I've got absolutely no idea why I would of emptied it! 

Not to worry, the pics of Enuf are back on and when I've finished the bottom

another , or two.
