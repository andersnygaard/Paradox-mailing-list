Subject: Re: Plans ?

Hello, I would like to see a set of the plans, are they located online somewhere? If I can find them online is there a fee to open then to study only and is there a fee to build one boat?

You can get a lot information by visiting my Paradox web site:

http://www.paradox-uk.co.uk 

where there are many links to other sites with facts about Paradox.  The address for obtaining the plans is detailed there.

The 'Information' page at the above site has a link to 2 drawings from Matt Layden's plans.

One question I have is has anyone added a few feet to the LOA and made it a bit wider in at the same time? I am thinking around 20 feet as I am   a bigger person at 6' and 225 LBS. I think if I crossed my legs I would heal over in the 15 footer.

By searching the files section of this group you'll find most of your questions answered.  Likewise if you do a search of the discussion archives you'll find answers to most of them, including stretching the length of Paradox.

Thank you for all the information and photos. I have very much enjoyed taking the helm sitting at my desk and dreaming of the warm water running under the keal (oh yah no keal).  Don in Spokane, WA. Soon to build something strong, quick and cheap for a San Juan Island trip next summer.

Maybe you can practise some of the building methods used on Paradox in preparation for building an extended version of the boat.

Best wishes,
Bill.
