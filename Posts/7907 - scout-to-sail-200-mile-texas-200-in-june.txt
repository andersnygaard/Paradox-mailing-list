Scout has committed to sailing the 200 mile Texas 200 in June of 2014. This event is being done as a fundraiser for the "Livestrong Foundation" that provides supports for cancer survivors, those in the fight, and those that we have lost. Scout will be adorned with the names of all of the above on her sides. If you are interested in finding out more or supporting the cause...please check out my blogpost. All the info is on there. Here is a direct link to that post.
