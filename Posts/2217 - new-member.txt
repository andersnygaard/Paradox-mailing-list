Hi Folks ...

I'm new to this group and have been studying the Paradox and Little Cruiser websites for ideas and information.  I have a few questions for ya' all.   ( best southern accent I can muster )

(1) Is there a set of plans for Paradox that is a little bit bigger than 14'?
(2) What is the time factor to build a Paradox?
(3) What is the estimated cost to build one?
(4) Finally ... who buys the beer around here during the construction phase?

Reasons for the questions :

(1) My wife wants to go sailing with me but she needs more room for makeup.
(2) At the rate we are seeing hurricanes I may need the boat faster than expected
(3) The wife and I spend equally so if I can build it for say 5K for the boat it will in reality cost me 10K
(4) Self explainatory   ;-)

All kidding aside .... I want a boat that we can travel with on a trailer to the Western US for sailing/camper style fun on large mountain lakes/ coastal areas and that we wouldn't hesitate to take over to the Bahamas as well ( We live in Sebring, Florida ).  I love the fact of the beachability of the Paradox , AND, I think it's just about the best looking boat around.

We have looked at all the plastic boats and have not been impressed.  I do like the Sea Pearl 21 Tri but at 20K for the boat, 40K total ( damned wife ), kills my pocket right now.  Looked at the Montgomery 15 ( nice ) but still many questions.

OK ... I give.  I think building one would be fun as hell.
So shoot me for being honest ...

Thanks for any comments or recommendations
I love the group


I Hope This Helps ...
Keep Looking Up

Doc
