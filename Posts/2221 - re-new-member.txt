Hi Folks ...

I'm new to this group and have been studying the Paradox and Little Cruiser websites for ideas and information. I have a few questions for ya' all. 

(1) Is there a set of plans for Paradox that is a little bit bigger than 14'?

Since the plans are metric it is quite easy to scale up I would think. Increasing all the dimensions by 15% still keeps it inside two sheets of plywood and gives room for a bed for two without being cramped too much.

Cheers, Nels
