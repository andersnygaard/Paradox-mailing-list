Why can't I access any of the online docs?

It will depend on how you are getting to the site. If you use yahoo IM to check your mail and then go the the web browser to read it and then sign out of yahoo like I first did,.. well you cant access the docs on the board.. You must log in using the "log in" link on the board or first go to yahoo mail and sign in, then, open another window to go to the paradox group. You must be logged in to Yahoo in order to access the groups files.
Hope this helps,
Rod
