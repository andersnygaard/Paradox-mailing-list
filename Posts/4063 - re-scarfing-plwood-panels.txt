Subject: Re: Scarfing plwood panels

Just be aware that the first 2 methods shorten the overall length of the joined panels. That means if you join two 8' sheets of plywood you won't get a 16' panel.

I know of 2 other methods that allow getting a 16' panel from two 8' pieces of plywood. Both require a 4" belt sander and/or a plane and chisel. The first method you butt the two sheets together as shown in method 3 at your site. Then you remove a 4" x 1/4" layer from the join and insert a 1/4" butt strap that gets embedded flush to the panel surface. The second method you only take off about 1/8" with the belt sander and epoxy two 4" wide strips of cloth with enough filler to make the join smooth. This last method is the one I now prefer. It is often referred to as a "Payson" joint. 

Dynamite Payson actually used to grind out a couple layers in the ply with an electric grinder and fill in  hollow with glass matt and then the glass tape over it, then grind it all smooth:-)
