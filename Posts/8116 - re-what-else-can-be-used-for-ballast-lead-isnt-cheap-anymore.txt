Well, you could stock up on a range of spare anchors. A big battery is always nice. Emergency stores can weigh quite a bit. A comprehensive tool kit and spares is always useful

I only have about 75lb of actual ballast, the rest is made up of stuff which I thought might come in useful some time. The bicycle is one that gets used quite often.

The big advantage of a boat that is supposed to be heavy is that you can load it up with stuff that *may* come in useful.
