Pete, 

I spent alot of time looking thru your build site and really enjoyed all the pics. Its great to see you have gotten so much of it completed. I need to visit your area some day to make the bike trip to the pub, that must have been great everyone ridding back home with a buzz and feeling good. 

Pete do you have any long distance trips in mind for this boat when your done? Its great to read the stories of others who are able to take there little boats on long trips hope to be reading about your adventures soon.

I need to start building my paradox this year I waited a couple of years hoping someone else would build a larger version of paradox but looks like I will be building her stock and will work on gaining more interior room by reducing my own size, eating better and drinking less beer. Im 6'4 and 260# so you can see my concern on interior size but paradox is such a unique boat and for me it has a feeling no other boat brings so I dont have a choice.

Regards,
