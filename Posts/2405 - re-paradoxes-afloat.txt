Hi Paul,

There is a file called "long Micro" at the microcruising group that may be of interest.

http://groups.yahoo.com/group/microcruising/

In it is a photo of a Bolger Long Micro, a regular Micro and an Oldshoe - all pulled up on a beach. Many people prefer to anchor a bit offshore due to bugs and other critters, but as you can see the Micros are not that bad for beachability. That is because the bow area is very shallow. In fact the first foot or so is usually above
the water. I have heard of anyone feeling it necessary to tow a dingy from a Micro.

Cheers, Nels
