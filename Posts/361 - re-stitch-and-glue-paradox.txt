Subject: Re: Stitch and Glue Paradox

I'm not sure that using stitch-and-glue would actually buy you anything in terms of simplifying the construction. You need real chine logs in order to have chine runners, and the weight savings of using stitch-and-glue would actually work against you because Paradox needs to be heavily ballasted to sit on her lines and not slide sideways upwind.

What are you trying to accomplish by switching to stitch-and-glue?
