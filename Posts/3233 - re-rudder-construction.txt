No problems with mine. I think Matt has many thousands of miles on Paradox with out problems.

Hi,
Like other aspects of Paradox, the rudder is a bit different
from the 'norm'. Most lifting rudder-blades are sandwiched between
TWO cheek pieces (on the stock) which take any side-thrusts. Anyone
got any comments about this? I haven't seen any (comments)on the group
so I presume it must be plenty strong enough as is...Does the washer/nut
not tend to eat away at the wood/fiberglass with use?
Thanks,
Alan.
