I couldn't make it work without the topping lift. As soon as I slackened off 
the halyard the boom dropped onto the cabin roof and banged about as I hauled 
on the furling line. With thicker rope it is possible that I could keep enough 
tension on the line to keep it up, but you have to pull hard even with the 
topping lift.
