I finally rebuilt my boom, paying more attention to making it spin smoothly without the sail attached. I also added a topping lift and found it to work just fine being attached to the front only. I also added the double pulley to the arm and am pleased with it other than the fact that that it requires a lot of pulling and a lot of rope. The system reefs and furls now. I guess I am out of excuses and will have to put it in the water soon. Thanks for all the help.
