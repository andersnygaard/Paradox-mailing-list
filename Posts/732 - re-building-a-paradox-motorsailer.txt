Thanks for your response Al,

I'm not interested in a canal boat. It is just that some of the lakes where I will hopefully be sailing are connected by small rivers with bridges and weirs, somewhat similar to canals. The motorboats regularly move from one lake to the next, while the sailboats are stuck in whatever lake their home marina is located. I was under the impression that Paradox could be scaled upwards without it becoming a sow's ear.

I believe that you are correct, in fact Jeff, who can be found on this group and the microcruising group sometimes is designing a boat based on paradox, but longer and lighter.

The notion of dumping raw sewage overboard, is not a part of my being a responsible person. Not to mention being illegal. How do you plan to handle that rather delicate subject?

The same way as 99% of the UK boating population, and all the seals and seabirds, though my technique will be less technological than most yachts and more technological than the birds. This is not illegal in the UK.

Water quality has become an important issue round the UK coast in recent years so regular checks (sometimes daily) are made at popular tourist sites. Surprisingly, even in crowded estuaries such as Salcombe, there is no sign of pollution.

My motor boat has a portapotti, but as often as not, it gets emptied over the side (clear of the coast) as there are few facilities for emptying them ashore.

Hoping for calm nights
