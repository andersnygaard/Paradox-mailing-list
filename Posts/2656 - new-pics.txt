Subject: new pics

Hi all,

I have posted 4 new pics in the paraplastic folder in the files section.

Frequently, I have to find other solutions on Matt's construction because of the BRIS-method. "Roof support" shows how I made the pools for the roof first. They became remarkably strong. "Roof on" shows the interior, painted. The thing under the front window is for mounting the compass. Hope it won't disturb the view. "Roof edges" shows that I have to take the divinycell away on each free edge. In this case replace it with epoxy and fibreglass filler, as shown in "roof edges puttied", so that there is something to screw the windows to.

Have been cutting the windows today.
