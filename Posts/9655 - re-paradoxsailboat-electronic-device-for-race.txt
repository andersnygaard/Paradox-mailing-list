Rob what do you think about the most adventurous paradox in 2021 wins. 
That would just encourage someone to do something silly or dangerous for the money.

If you want Paradox's racing then finish yours and go and sail with others.

I have sailed quite extensively with another Paradox. Interestingly we 
were almost perfectly matched. We could sail within talking distance of 
each other for quarter of an hour without touching the controls. If we 
had been racing I would usually have won as he carried an engine so 
never really learned to sail up wind efficiently.
