Hi Jeff.

The length of the sleeping area is 1900mm and the distance between the bins is 920mm at frame 3.
If the lip of the opening on frame 2 was lowered flush with the cabin sole, the radius in the lower corners reduced to 50mm and the opening with trimmed back to the bin and mast box, you could stick your feet into the foreword "stateroom".
Cruising two in a PARADOX, one of your size and your son, unknown size, would probably best  done by sleeping on the beach in a tent.
Matt and his partner, being of slight build and size, managed to sleep on board.
Even if you left out the bins you still have frame 3 in the way.
You could very well take off 1" from the frame and glassing the frame to the hull and reducing the side panel from 1/2" to 3/8" to reduce the pressure on that frame.
NOLI, which is the same size as PARADOX, has her sides made from 1/4" marine grade plywood and frame 3 is made from 3/8".
You can see from a photo in my NOLI folder how much room there is when you leave out the bins which is what I have done.
