Here is what Sven saidabout his chine runner boat Yrvind that he took to Martinique.

=E2=80=9Cstrangely the biggest problem was that she had too much stability, she did not heel enough. That gave her lee helm and the chinerunners did not dig in enough.=E2=80=9D

Hi , I=E2=80=99m interested in the idea of a sea anchor , has anyone set a sea anchor , I anger , on a Paradox
And in my humble opinion the chine runners are ok and the limiting factor is the slap on the bottom of the hull , a flat bottomed boat gets slapped going into wind into waves .
I=E2=80=99ve buried my bow with extra ballast to try and minimise the slapping that slows me , and will anchor up or beach if confronted by unfavourable wind . 
In protected waters it=E2=80=99s no problem , I=E2=80=99ve tacked up a narrow river with great success .

Roselt,

Thanks for posting your story. In the circumstances you found yourself in, and if you hadn't had access to a tow, I'm wondering if there would have been a benefit to deploying either a drogue or a sea anchor until more favorable winds arrived? The idea being that they might have stabilized your boat and thus reduce your sea sickness, plus they might have slowed your drift into shore.

Another (heretical) question I have was whether chine runners really provide sufficient leeway prevention in tight situations? Would you have been better off with a more conventional daggerboard or centerboard? Some may know of the Swede Sven Yrvind, and his attempts to sail small boats long distances. As I recall he has conversed with Matt Layden and tried chine runners on his boats, but eventually went back to some sort of board.
