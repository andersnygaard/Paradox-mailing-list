Subject: Re: New guy question about interior finish

On my Micro all the "bright work" like out wales, rubbing strips, toe rails etc., are coated with Cetol applied over bare mahogany. Some of the finish is crazing and cracking along the upper edges from the sun I assume. This is after 12 years of being outside all year round.

The masts and yards are varnished over epoxy (Captains varnish) and badly require refinishing.

The interior is off-white house paint and polyurethane on pine stripped "ceilings" which on a boat are actually the walls. 

Free-flooding wells fore and aft are light grey porch paint. Outer hull and decks Brightsides marine paint.

I think tinted lexan provides great UV protection, both to paint and the interior cushions.

Cedar interior linings would really be nice left unfinished IMO.
