I too have considered converting to a removable rear window. One 
of my few criticisms is that you have to either be inside or outside 
with no in between.

As to the stability with the higher weight, On one of my trips I 
spent 15 hours sitting down on one passage. The next day I made 
the return passage in 7 hours, most of it standing up! I have since 
acquired better cushions! If the raised weight were a problem it 
would probably be time to retreat below.
