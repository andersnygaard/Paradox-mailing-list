The weight is irrelevant as there is a couple of hundred pounds of lead ballast that can be removed to compensate.

On my Paradox the clearance between floor and ceiling (sitting headroom inside) is 860mm (~34 inches).

Sleeping accommodation as designed is 1.8m (~5' 11") but with a minor mod this could be extended by a further 0.8m (~31").
