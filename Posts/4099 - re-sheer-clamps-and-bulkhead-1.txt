Subject: Re: Sheer clamps and bulkhead #1.

I'm jumping away ahead of myself here, but I'll ask as the questions arise. I noticed on Bill's photos that the sheer clamp is notched about 500mm from the stern (i.e. its not the full length of the sheer). I hadn't noticed this on anyone else's build photos where they appear to continue the full length of the sheer. Checking the plans, sheet#3 does clearly show this cutout (I think!) but can't quite work out why it's there. I think it's for clearance for the steering lines, but not entirely sure. Is it necessary?

You've got it...The steering lines are right on the level of the sheer, so the blocks leading the lines forward are best kept on that level....is it necessary??? I am not sure, but that is the way it's drawn....

Number 1 bulkhead must be open for the mast to stow inside. Some builders of finished boats have made some comment about the light on the top of the mast making it difficult or impossible to stow. Plan 7 shows an alternative "eliminate Op'g and provide port" presumably similar to the transom port and water tank ports. If the bulkhead is open, it should have limber holes.

Bulkhead 1. If it's left open, is it not better to put some limbers in to drain any water to the bilge? Will the mast fit internally if the bulkhead is left solid? I intend to open it up anyway but just curious.
