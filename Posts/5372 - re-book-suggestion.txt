Actually I like the night much more. I generally have the whole puget 
sound to myself. Navigating by the lighthouses are easier to see at 
night than the hazy view usually seen by day. Ferryboats and very few 
and very slow tugboats are the only company. No drunken drivers with 
speedboats or jetskis to annoy either. In moonlight it can be 
transendental-ish. Steve Yahn

It should not be difficult to make a plug-in light.

However it might be worth noting that in the 5 years since I launched 
Little Jim I have used the tricolour only once, and then I don't 
believe there was anyone else around to see it. I have used the all-
round-white a few times when anchoring, but a light hoist in the 
toping lift would have done just as well.

I have much more faith in my powerful hand-held torch.

It may be different where you sail, of course.
