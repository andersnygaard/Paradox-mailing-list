Bulkhead 1 has an offset of 5mm in its side.
Bulkhead 2 has an offset of 7mm in its side.
Bulkhead 3 has an offset of 5mm in its side.

Bulkhead 4 and the transom show no offset.  I assume these two have straight sides.  Anyone have trouble getting the plywood sides to bend like this?  Does the side nail up nicely to the bulkheads?

Not me. I just banged in the nails and it pulled it down, no problem.
