Thank-you,

Since I have a small build area to work in I have decided to do every little bit of work that is possible before having to put the hull together. I think I will go with the new sail plan kit and sew this together before hull assembly also. That way the day the boat itself is finished..... I can go sailing. (weather permitting) ...
