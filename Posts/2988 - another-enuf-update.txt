Subject: Another Enuf update

Just finished smoothing the bottom and Number One Son is available tomorrow for mixing epoxy as I lay on the biaxial weave stuff.

I am intending to take the biaxial stuff about one inch up the sides all round to protect the bottom edge and the chine runners. I have radiused the chine to allow that.

I have noticed that where I have sheathed the sides and run down onto the chine runners there are one or two small white spots in the angle between chine runner and side. I guess that this is where there is no epoxy holding the sheathing into the angle.

Should I cut the white spots out and put a dab of filler in or inject epoxy into the voids?

Thanks for any help.

Don came up trumps with ballast info. He has sent me a 14 page .pdf with plenty of detail about placement.
