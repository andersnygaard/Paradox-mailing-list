Subject: Beginners guide to building a Paradox

Fellow Paradoxicals

On Paradoxboatbuilders2 I have posted a file with a title something like the subject heading here. It is a short, 4 page record of my own building experience and what I think that I have learnt about necessary reading, tools, etc. 

I have made it short by not repeating myself meaning I have not said the same twice if I could help it. I'll happily accept suggestions for alterations and additions to the text from other builders to give beginners a copywrite free guide to Paradox building. Feel free to amend.

Cheers
