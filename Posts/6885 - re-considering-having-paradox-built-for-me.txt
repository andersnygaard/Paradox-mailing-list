Subject: Re: Considering Having Paradox Built for Me.

I doubt if a hinged hatch would be any safer. First you have the problem of where it goes when opened, and does it foul on anything (boom?). Then there is the disadvantage that it is either open or shut. I often sail with my hatch pulled half shut, perhaps to keep out rain or spray or just the cold wind.

As it is the Paradox is orders of magnitude safer than most boats of a similar size. I really don't want to sail with you if you need a boat safer than a standard Paradox.

This could be a good solution, Do you need a solar array? Just put in 3 or 4 times as much battery capacity and leave out some lead ballast.

I have never felt the need for more ventilation, in fact I find a towel useful to stuff in the vent box to reduce the air flow. In warmer climes it may be an issue. I would not risk the front or side windows leaking, but a removable rear window, like Little Cruiser, seems to work well.
