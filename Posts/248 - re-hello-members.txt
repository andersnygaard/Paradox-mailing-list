I own a set of paradox plans and I have never built a boat. However, I have no intention of building Paradox yet. I just ordered plans for a 12' signet dory from Selway Fisher. While I have read countless books on how to build boats, and I know exactly what to do, I think I'm going to struggle the first time while I make all my mistakes. I will probably struggle on my 2nd and 3rd dinghies as well. Then I will be confident enough to tackle paradox. I think there is a difference between knowing how to do something and being capable of doing it. That said, I'm sure others would have no problem with Paradox as their first boat. I guess it's just a question of breaking down the complicated overall thing into a series of smaller more manageable jobs.
