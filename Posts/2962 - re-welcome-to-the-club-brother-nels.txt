That's at least two of my favourite correspondents banned by Don.
Have you thought of starting a group for people banned?

It's more than that, Alf. 

I was showing a high-tech sailing sea kayak at a Madison, WI  boat show one year and 
"The Donald, jr." invited me, personally, to join the group as he thought his gang would 
enjoy the project I had completed. It never got that far.

Don Elliott is just a total, maladjusted, boat nerd with extremely poor social skills and a 
huge philosophical axe to grind. He's open to ideas, as long as they're his. His one saving 
grace is his ability to draw pretty pictures.

Since I'm a decent illustrator, myself, I don't see that as enough to justify the arrogance.

For what it's worth, I banned myself from Uncle Donnie's SmallBoats group due to 
unredeemable moronic behavior on the part of the group's leader. He now has Rex the 
wonder dog who will snuggle-up to every one of his glorious declarations of what's right 
in the world of boats.

Rex has his own peculiar ideas about what's wrong with thousands of years of 
Polynesian proa development, just to show that the same ear of corn can be shucked 
twice.

For what it's worth, the Paradox is easy enough to build that you don't need Don's little, 
over-priced, hyper-copyrighted booklet to get it right. Trust yourself and Matt's original 
vision.
