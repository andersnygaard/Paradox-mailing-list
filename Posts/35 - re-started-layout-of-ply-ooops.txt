Hi Al,

1. Matt indicates the butt for Blkd # 2 at 100mm(stbd) from the centerline of ship, I can't recall why I moved it but I did to 50 mm off the cl. (if you use an extra sheet, which you should have too, make sure the grain of the ply runs as Matt has indicated).
2. About the transom, I just now added the dimension of the height of the transom and the side panel and there is about 4 cm to spare, I'd recheck my layout first of the side panel it should be about 670 tall (the 28m is the top controlling or base dim) and the transom should be about 510 cm tall, that gives you about an 3.9cm (inch to 1.5) left.
3. I could not get the rudder cheeks out of the 18 mm sheet (with the bow section) so I bought a half sheet to make those parts, everything else should work as Matt has indicated.
4. Be sure to mark those side panels which is which and what is the inside and what is out, or you be making new ones. 
5. It should take you six months to build Paradox, when you get the hull done let us know and I'll give you some tips to finish the end bits.

Check your layout...twice... before you cut.

Don.
