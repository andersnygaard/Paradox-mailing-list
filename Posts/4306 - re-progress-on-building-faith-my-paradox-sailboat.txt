Lignum vitae would be good. Getting hold of it is difficult.
Classic Marine here in the UK has some rings of the stuff, that could
be set into the yuloh shaft.  I might investigate that line of
enquiry. A mixture of graphite with epoxy could be good for forming
the insert or cup. Thanks for these useful suggestions.
