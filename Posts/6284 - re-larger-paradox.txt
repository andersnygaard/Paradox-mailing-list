Almost anything is possible. You can enlarge a boat in one two or three dimensions. One builder of a Paradox butted the side panels together rather than the designed scarf. making the hull about 8 inches long longer. The cutting plan as layed out will not work so unless you do a lot of extra work you may waste a lot of plywood by cutting inefficiently. 
Your boat will be heavier. You will probably need more ballast, and perhaps carry more water, One of the delights of the Paradox is that it is close to being the largest (displacement) boat you could tow behind a small car. In simple terms added displacement means more seaworthy. If you have a larger vehicle that may not be a concern. 
You will need more sail area to drive the added displacement. do you know how to do this???....its not really that simple because the dynamics of the hull are different from most boats. 
This problem is both simple and complex. You mess with the design in any significant respect without knowing what the consequences are going to be you may end up with a doondoggle that does not do anything as well as the original does because IT was done by someone with both experience and knowledge.

I would like to add that enlarging any design takes away from its versatility and convenience. You need more building space. Heavier to trailer and launch and retrieve. Maybe a more expensive motor and more costly sail. The cost and weight goes up exponentially.

With the Paradox sail plan - you end up with a big roll of sail on the boom when reefed down. That would have to taken into account as well in my view.
