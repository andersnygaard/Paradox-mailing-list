Thank you for the suggestions. I definitely will give them a try when the season begins. Very pleased with the boat. No difficulties in tacking at all as long as I carry some momentum into the turn. I do carry full water ballast and near 400 pounds of lead, with 32 pounds of it forward of bulkhead number 1. I have a Suzuki 2.5 on the port stern so I have one less 32 pound block of lead on the port side. I carry 4 blocks forward of bulkhead number 3 (two on each side). This seems to balance the boat very well. Again, thank you for your replies and ideas.
