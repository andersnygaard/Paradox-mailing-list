Mate,

Just hearing you and I had the same problem until I put a 'topping lift' on front and back. I know you said don't mention a topping lift but if you think about it, it is the only way you can make it work reliably.

Front is just a clove hitch or bowline around the metal in front of the drum,
Aft end is a bolt with a shackle at the bottom and the mainsheet block hanging down. Needs to be loosely fitted with washers so it will spin as the main boom rolls. More weight below the swivel point than above.. See photo attached

Topping lift has a bowline in the end up high and the actual piece of line that runs from the front of the boom up to the bowline and then down aft to the swivel fitting is free to move around.. You could use a metal ring which would be good but another thing to lose IMHO.

Happy to help but until you do it you will be in all sorts of trouble I reckon. it just won't work in my experience. I thought I had wasted a heap of time, effort and thought until I put the topping lift on.

Sorry about covering the lower end of the boom swivel piece. Can get you a photo later if you want.
