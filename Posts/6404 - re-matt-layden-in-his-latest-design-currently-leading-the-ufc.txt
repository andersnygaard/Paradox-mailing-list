Just pondering. I have been amazed as he has simply blown me away with 
the performance of this little boat of his. Perhaps its just his experience 
as a sailor (and ability to sail with so little sleep?).

From my experience in Little Jim I would put a lot of it down to the 
"comfort factor". He has no need to wear restricting wet weather gear, but 
can get away with comfortable clothing. He doesn't waste energy keeping 
warm. If he wants to stop for a rest it is a matter of seconds between 
dropping the anchor and being curled up in his sleeping bag. Altogether much 
more relaxing than sitting out in the wind an spray.


Hoping for calm nights
