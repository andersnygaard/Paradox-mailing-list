I just read in a different forum where some guy made a couple of yuloh's and
said his boat was faster when he just used a straight vertical oar instead
of the yuloh!!!  Robb

Wow... haven't started the yulah yet... havta wait til Monday. But I
am glad I read this post cause when I looked at the plans I assumed I
was reading them wrong and the flat part of the blade was supposed to
go vertical to the water. This is a really weird way to think of a
paddle working. Thanks for the explanation. Rod


It works like an aircraft wing or propeller blade producing lift by
it's shape and angle of attack. (Just like those awkward things, a
keel or centre-board, that some sailors still insist on putting up
with.  :-)
