Subject: Paradox's ballast intallation part 2
Date: Mon, 17 Nov 2003 07:39:44 -0600

Good morning,

For those interested, Paradox's Ballast Installation part 2 article has been written and placed on the new Paradox boat building group (see link below). The article describes in detail the installation of the ballast pigs, how to do it, and the tools required for the job. It is fully illustrated to clarify the task.

In the future, all new Paradox building articles will be located on this new building site only. If there are any special notices or news items, I will place them on this group (Paradoxbuilders). 

If you have any questions about Paradox building, I will answer on either group. This new group is more focused on the Paradox boat building process, and not other issues concerning the craft.

Thank you,
Don Elliott
