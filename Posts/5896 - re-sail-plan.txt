Subject: Re: sail plan

Dividing the sail plan has the advantage you mention, along with another: with the mainsheet let fly and mizzen sheeted in, she'll weathervane nicely and ride hove-to like the most serene duck.  My cat ketch can be "parked" this way (with adequate room to lee) for as long as I like--very useful in so many circumstances.  On the other hand, a yawl's mizzen (being so small) wouldn't subtract much sail area from the main.

Yes, I would think at the very least you would have to use some mechanical advantage to be able to raise it, which would mean a whole lot more halyard to store somewhere if you were to do it with blocks at either 2:1 or 3:1.

Would it be blasphemy to consider an alternate sail plan....such as a cat yawl or similar? (like a bolger micro)

It seems like it would be a more efficient rig...although it would have complications such locations of spars, size of sails, how to operate from below, etc.

Hope I am not too far off asking this question....and wonder if anyone else has considered altering the sail plan?
