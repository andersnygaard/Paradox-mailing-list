The 60=C2=BA angle is because the halyard feeds from the starboard, aft position of the mast. The yard raises on the port side.
Not off centreing it would cause more friction than there already and make it difficult to raise and furl the sail.
I'd also make the Halyard in as thick a gauge line as possible, or make it in two parts, with as much of the handling part as possible in the larger gauge.
I need leather gloves to furl ; a thin line will cut your hands to shreds.

Thanks for your reply. Yes, I found the rope diameters on the material list. I'd forgotten about the list ( have been building for 4 years).
I understand about the 60 degrees, but had some trouble finding out which way to fit the sheave.
Thanks again!
