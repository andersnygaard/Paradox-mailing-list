Pete posted a photo in mesg #6457

Would be interesting to know more about it. Looks like it might be sunbrella. I thought it might have a spray skirt to allow paddling in the rain, but this one doesn't look like it does. Nor even a transparent section to view the sail from below decks.

Nels,
Have any photos with the hatch on turned up.  I'm thinking that it's a neat little boat!  Now back to my current build!
