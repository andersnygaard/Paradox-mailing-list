Everything in the south sound is scheduled according to tides. Plenty of delta and mudflat areas to explore, and you have the perfect boat for it. If you go north the Tacoma Narrows is the biggest challenge, time the tides right and shoot through, then try and make the turn north before the tide changes again, otherwise drop anchor and wait it out. After the Narrows everything else is pretty easy. 

If it were my trip I would stay south of the Narrows as its not that interesting a trip until you get all the up to the San Juan islands, and that's too far to go round trip in 2 weeks. 

Good luck
