Subject: Paradox Plans and Building Guide

It does not work. No answer from mbolduc at triad.rr.com.

Any have a phone number? How about letting Duckworks sell the plans and that building guide I have read about.

Fernando, try going to this link: http://microcruising.com/
Then go to the bottom of the page, and clink on the [email] link. 

Hopefully, that is the correct contact information.  Hopefully, it isn't the same email you already tried.
