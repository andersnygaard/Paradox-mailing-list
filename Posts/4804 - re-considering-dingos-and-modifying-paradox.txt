Subject: Re: Considering Dingos and Modifying Paradox

A Paradox increased in size by 20% has been approved in principle by
Matt Layden. I think there is a file here giving instructions.

I'll bet there have been about 40 members who have suggested this very
same thing. Why it has never been done and the results posted is
beyond me. I suspect it is not as easy as it may seem after the first
surge of enthusiasm has subsided. 

So go for it and keep us posted! Be a pioneer and win us over:-)
