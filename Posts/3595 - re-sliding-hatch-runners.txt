Hi all, 

Since building Little Jim I have never been very happy with the way the hatch has slid open and closed. Following the advice of someone on (I think) the uk.rec.waterways newsgroup I have just fitted new running surfaces. These were made from formica strip intended for edging kitchen work-tops. 

First impressions are that it has solved all the sticking problems. whether it will be durable, only time will tell. 

Hi Al, 

How did you attach the new running surface to the boat? Contact cement only? Would just having the formica on the lower surface alone work do you think? Two options I have considered are UHMW strips or brass. 

The hatch is foam lined, and the upstand round the edge of the aperture is shown, in the plans, running on the foam (if you have the plans look at sheet 5). This helps to seal the hatch, but caused me problems of wear on the foam. I tried PTFE tape, but that just rucked up. The best I had till now was brown parcel tape which lasted about half a season. I used double sided tape to stick the formica to the foam. This may make the seal less watertight, but the lid slides much more smoothly. 

I considered brass strip myself, but couldn't get any thin enough. 

Hoping for calm nights
