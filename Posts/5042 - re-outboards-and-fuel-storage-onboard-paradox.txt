The sensible solution, for boat use, is to pay the extra and get a sealed battery (Gell Cell or AGM). My AGM has no vents at all and claims it can be mounted at any attitude, and will work under water (though I hope never to test that particular claim).

Yes, safer. You can't easily spill acid either.

But don't they need more care while charging? More expensive too. I use one on my microlight but it doesn't seem to last very long before it has to be replaced. That might be because the regulated output from the engine doesn't suit that type of battery well. I'm using the sealed lead acid Yuassa type incidently.
