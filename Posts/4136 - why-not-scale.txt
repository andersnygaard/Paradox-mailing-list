Subject: Why not scale?

I understand the plywood argument against a linear scaling of the plans. Plywood is available in 4'x8' sheets, and good bloody luck finding anything else. BUT if one were to completely throw this argument out the window - let's assume the wood can be sourced. What are the remaining arguments against scaling the design to 133 or even 150%?

This could make a ~21 foot boat, with room enough to store huge amounts of stuff (picnic? dinner party? radar/gps? wide screen TV?), room to sleep 3 fairly comfortably and maybe even 4 people.

It would go faster assuming displacement also stays in proportion, safer big water crossings, more cargo options, etc, and yet still pretty trailerable.

So, besides plywood and moral objections, why, or why not? What additional obstacles would someone face by straight scaling to the larger dimensions?
