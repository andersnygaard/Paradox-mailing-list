I placed mine at 14 inches below the deck, because that is the thickest part of the stem and I was thinking about what would happen if I had to take a tow, but now think that is too low. I never use it apart from securing the boat to it's trailer and it's a bit low to be optimal for that. I anchor from the deck cleats. I'd probably go for 10 inches, if I was to do it again so that it was more of a horizontal pull onto the trailer. By the way, I float the boat onto my trailer, rather than winching it up.
