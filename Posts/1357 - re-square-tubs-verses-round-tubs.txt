Subject: Re: Square tubs verses round tubs

I read these posts with great interest as I use a well known 5:1 ratio epoxy.  I use fancy feast cans left over from feeding my two cats, and use my fingers (with gloves on) to mix with.  The bottom of these cans are slightly rounded and I'm careful to rub against the bottom to be sure to get all the residual hardener.  I take time mixing and have never had a problem with epoxy not curing.  

My question is why not use vinegar?  I'm careful not to get epoxy on my skin but sometimes a few dribbles get on my arms and I use vinegar to wipe it off immediately.  After all most of us use vinegar in our salads.  
For brushes I throw them away instead of cleaning with vinegar as I would think that residual vinegar would mess up the epoxy curing if I were to use the brush again.

Will.
