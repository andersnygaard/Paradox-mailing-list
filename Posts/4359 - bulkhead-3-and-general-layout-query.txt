OK, I feel something progressing now!

My 10 sheets of ply arrived this morning, so this evening I made a start at laying out the bulkhead #3.

The "deck" area (i.e. from the sheer line towards midships) appears to be drawn as a straight line, whereas all other bulkheads follow the crown shown on bulkhead #2.

Before I fire up the jigsaw, did you cut this as a straight line or follow the deck curvature as per other BHs?

Either way, I'm sure it makes little difference. It just looked a bit nicer when I drew it with a bit of curve.

I picked Bulkhead 3 to start so that I could get rid of one sheet of 18mm asap - those babies are a right handful to move around on your own 

I wanted to also cut out the rudder stock at the same time but am worried about the placement of the parts and leaving enough material for the forward part of the bottom. I imagine the bottom needs to be made to fit at assembly; is there plenty of spare wood if I squeeze the rudder in to take up as little space as possible, or is it best to wait and make do with the cut-offs after fitting the bottom?

Any recommendation for a good Jigsaw blade to prevent break away of the outer veneers?

TIA

Pete
