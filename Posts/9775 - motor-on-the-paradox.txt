Subject: Motor on the Paradox

Hello Paradoxians,

There are those who enjoy having a motor on the paradox for many reasons, while others hate the entanglement the motor causes with the sheet.

I have attached two pictures I found on the Internet of a paradox where one can see the potential issues with the motor as the sheet dances with it.

What comments, solutions, and thoughts could you share regarding the mounting of a motor on the stern of the dox and the logistics of the managing the sheet?

The pictures below display the potential problems with the sheet lines. I remember seeing a dox with a trolling motor mounted onto the side.

Do most paradox sailers use the motor? I have been sailing for three years without a motor and limited to lakes whereby I there are no currents or tides.
