Hi I should add
When the sail us flying the pulleys all angle away from each other
Giving more " gap " between the ropes
As long as you can keep the ropes from binding it works well

This is the dogs breakfast at the top of the other mast I own
Each Block is staggered to miss the others when the sail is fully up
There are throat and peak haulyards here

It's awful looking , but it does NOT bind
An earlier rig of this mast had me stuck inbound to the marina with the sail locked fast UP
I threw the anchor out to slow my approach
(I nearly collided with a big expensive cruiser)
Then scrambled like a monkey on a slippery pole up the mast and hung from the sail till it furled.

It must have been hilarious for onlookers
I was bruised and sore and more than a bit embarrassed

The blocks had bound the ropes with pressure
The sail was laced too tight
Now she sails as planned
And it's easy to raise lower and trim

Good luck with yours

Nick , could you send me a picture if the top of your mast? I have purchased the double pulley for the Yard and one for the the mast. The area gets a little crowded and I would like to see how you arranged yours. I am looking at mounting the halyard pulley just above the sheave on the Port side. I see no problem with where to secure the halyard end at the top of the mast but where should the topping eye or pulley be mounted?
