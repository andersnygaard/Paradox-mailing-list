Subject: Re: Unfolding Calamity for Enuf

Thought about this later, if this is your first layer of cloth, can you remove it?? has any of the epoxy set at all??? the epoxy you were using and this is the same??  If you can remove the fabric and coat the wood again and coat the top, using a squeegee to press it into the fabric. you may want to try a test area or piece to see if it will work. acetone can be used as a cleaner thinner. however I have heard that it will cause bubbles in the epoxy if used too much, but if you are going with more coats over this one that wouldnt matter. be very carefull of fumes also!!!!!
