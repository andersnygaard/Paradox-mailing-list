Hi Bert,

That is a very clever idea and I am going to try it next time I put the rig up. It would greatly simplify the furling if it works. I must admit I was loath to add any more rigging then is absolutely necessary. I have installed the running rigging (topping lift) as described in an earlier post and it works very well. Experimentation reveled that the block attached to the down haul line didn't work as well as dead ending the two lifting lines and attaching the down haul to them. I very excited about trying your idea and hope to do so this afternoon. I'll get back and let you know how it works.

Happy New Year Everyone 
Glen
