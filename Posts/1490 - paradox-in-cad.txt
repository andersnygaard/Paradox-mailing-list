I've uploaded two pics to Paul's Files in the files section. There are a couple of mistakes in the model, the main one being the window frame vertical pieces should be wider at the base, deck didn't overlap the sides which the toerail hides pretty well. A few other minor mistakes I won't point out, and assorted missing hardware, but I ran out of steam, and wanted to finish up. If I have missed anything obvious let me know.
