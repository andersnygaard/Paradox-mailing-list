Yes, and no. If you flare out the bottom of the pipe it will do much
less damage then a cut end of the pipe. A small pad of glass/epoxy
round the deck fitting will also help to reduce the damage. But the
bottom line is that the paint is going to get scratched whatever you
do.

I suppose a bronze or stainless disc bonded on round the deck hole
may solve the problem if you are really worried.

Hoping for calm nights
