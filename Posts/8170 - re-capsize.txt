Hi William,

I'm not the best person to advise you on building matters since I bought my Paradox already built and have no experience of building one.

My boat is built according to the plans - I believe - and I've never had any problems with the rudder. But I'm timid when it comes to extreme weather and try to avoid the worst.

If I was going for an ocean voyage where I had to be able to cope with whatever weather happened, then I'd be reinforcing the rudder and the lower gudgeon in an attempt to make it bullet proof.

Best,
Jim
