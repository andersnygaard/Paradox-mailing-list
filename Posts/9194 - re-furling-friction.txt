Subject: Re: Furling Friction

Hi

My solution was to be into wind when furling
Furl a small amount at a time
Keep putting the boom back in the middle of the cabin roof each time
It comes down better on some occasions than others but it will eventually furl
And sit and stare at those rope angles and use BIG pulleys where possible
