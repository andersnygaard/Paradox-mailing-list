Subject: Looking for info on Matt l. Rob Royiod canoe sailing rig.

Hi all,

I was wondering if anyone knew about the sail rig Matt Laydon had on his Rob Royoid canoe. I'm putting together a similar Watertribe Class 1 boat, and would like to have an effective 1 meter downwind sail. Matt's design is proven and looks like I could copy it for a lot less than the $500 commercially available options.

Thanks,

Woody
