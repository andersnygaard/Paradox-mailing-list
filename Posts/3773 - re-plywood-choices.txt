Subject: Re: Plywood Choices


Heres one good suggestion,


    If I were to build another Paradox, and I may, course after I complete the micro8. would be to construct the sides out of 2 layers with opposing seams say dual 1/4 inch to make 1/2 " or dual 3/8ths to make 3/4... not only is this stronger, but fair to bend and more forgiving than scafs, and anybody thats worried about the inner core of the plywood has the peace of mind to know that they laminated it ;)

Now that's a good idea! I still have nightmares about bending the bottom and ended up cutting it in two and using a large butt joint. 
if you made the sides as you suggest could you do without the scarfs and use butt joints offset from each other?
