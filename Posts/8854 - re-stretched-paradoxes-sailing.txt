Yes I was speaking of batejarcat.  Hey, if you are out there, what happened? 

Off the top of my head, the paradox and the e460 have the same sail and mast setup.  The e460 is far less displacement but that was a moving target too.  I had it up to 750 lbs and I thought I could easily have added 50 percent more.  The Paradox I have is built to spec, and I find that if I do not put in the water ballast, I'm under ballasted.  Id say the amount of sail they both have is perfect (compromise).  I don't think there are really hard and fast rules to boat design, because literally everything is a trade-off.  If you want to get a general idea of what may or may not work in small boats without learning a bunch of technical stuff just compare boats of same size.  While your at it, remember displacement is a better measure of how "big" a boat is more than length.  Lastly, if you do want to delve into the tech bits of boat design, no place better than jmsboats.com with a full lineup of excellent essays on different aspects of design.
