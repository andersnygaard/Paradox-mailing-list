Should have said the clear short lengths of tubing are on each end of the hose.

Use a water level.
A hose with a clear 12" or 18" of tubing. Fill with water and determine WL as reference then go wherever you want on the hull with the other end and determine waterlevel WL.

David, for what it's worth, I stopped my bottom paint at the bottom of the transom and about 4 1/4 " up from the chine at the bow ( you have to measure back from the bow a little to find a flat spot to measure from.
A suggestion: level your boat using the floor boards as your reference, once level run a level line from the bottom of the transom to the bow, this is a little tricky because of the curvature of the hull. Trust your eye, if you use a piece of masking tape and barely stick it on it is easy to stand back and look at it . If there is a wave in it or it doesn't look straight lift from the bow and redo. Keep at it until it looks right. Some times it takes me four or five tries but I finally get it and so will you. If you can find a level surface to work on then all you have to do measure up from the floor to the bottom of the transom and then put ref marks along the hull the same distance.(after you have leveled the boat of course)
