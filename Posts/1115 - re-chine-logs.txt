I would suggest that with a boat as small as Paradox and with the amount of rocker it has that shifting the crew weight is the easist way to accomplish what your suggest.

That is another advantage of an inside steering location. You are not confined to the stern as in many small sailboats.

Would the lead runners be bolted through the chine logs? That would involve drilling holes into the bottom of the hull but the proper bedding compound would be needed right?
