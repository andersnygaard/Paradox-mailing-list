I think the dry weight of an as-designed Paradox is about 450# This is, of course, without any stores, water, lead ballast or equipment, just the boat only. (I don't know, maybe I made that part up.)

Of course dry weight is less than actual displacement. ...as
displacement assumes crew, stores, water ballast etc.

Anyone know what the estimated dry weight of Paradox is when built per
plan (displacement of 1410 lb) vrs. the larger version (displacement
of 2321 lbs)

This would give a better idea of tow ability.
