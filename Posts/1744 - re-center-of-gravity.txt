In my 90 degree knock-down I didn't move far. As we went over I reacted by bracing my hand against the window frame. Within a few seconds (before I had fully collected my thoughts) we were back up and sailing again. The cushion was still under my bottom.

I assume that Matt's stability calculations are based on a static center of gravity, with the boat loaded to the DWL. Upon a cursory glance at Sven Yrvind's new work, and specifically the drawings by Matt Layden, it appears that the crew is buckled into position. Can anyone confirm this? 

In my case, the center of gravity would change dramatically if my (m)ass were deposited on the upturned cabin top, during a roll. I weigh around 225lbs.

I'd be interested to read other folks' ideas in regard to securing the sailor to the sole. Velcro pants, belt and after centerline snaphook, automotive seatbelt, bubblegum... necessary?
