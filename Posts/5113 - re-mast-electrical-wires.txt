Subject: Re: Mast electrical wires

Thanks Al and Will. I will bring out the wire from the aft face of the mast. The wire connection won't need watertiteness if I bring the wire upwards under the vent baffle (just like the halyard and reefline) and then socket in at a high location in the port side of the vent box. I did a search of the messages for this topic. There is lots of guidance. I should have looked there first. Cheers,
