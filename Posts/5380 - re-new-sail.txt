Subject: Re: NEW SAIL

After getting the balance sorted I lengthened my gap to about 12 inches so that the sail material was not trapped between the yard and mast. As long as the sail is tensioned along the Yard it could be much longer without significant effect on the performance. I also added a wear patch to the lower sleeve where the boom presses it against the mast.

Hoping for calm nights
