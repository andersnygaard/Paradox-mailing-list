I have the opportunity to go sailing for an extended period of time. I
have decided to sell TARDIS rather than have her sit gathering dust while I
sail around the world. If anyone is interested in her, give me a call.
832.859.8416 I will be leaving the first week in Jan, but have someone
that can show her if she doesn't sell before I leave.
