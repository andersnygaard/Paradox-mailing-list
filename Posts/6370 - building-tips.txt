I want to tell of something that happened to me this last summer while on the Paradox. I was near Gig Harbor and using my yuloh as my engine wouldnt work. Something distracted me, I forget now what, but my yuloh had slipped away and was drifting away from me very slowly in the current. I was very annoyed and a little scared of loosing it. I picked up the wooden seat board and used it as a paddle and cought up to the yuloh. It was clumsy going but I got it.

The seat is a paddel.
