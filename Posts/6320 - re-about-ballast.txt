Subject: Re: About ballast

What's the suitable ballast for Paradox?(excluded water tank's water.)
What I mean is in normal condition(one or two person on board),and I
think the ballast will affect the boat's performance. 

Get someone to look at the boat while you are aboard and load it down 
to the lines shown on the plans. My experience suggests that too much 
is better than too little.

Hoping for calm nights
