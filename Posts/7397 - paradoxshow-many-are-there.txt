Subject: Paradox's...how many are there??

Does anyone know? 

I am finishing up the construction of Scout, (Formerly known as Tardis) and I find myself wondering how many other Paradox's are out there and sailing. Sure would be cool to meet up sometime. 

Does anyone have a registry to list?? Being new to the micro cruiser world...I bet there is info already gathered on this, I am just probably ignorant of where to find it.

Thanks!
