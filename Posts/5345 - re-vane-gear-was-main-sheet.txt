Subject: Re: Vane Gear was: Main sheet

Hi Mark'

That's the same website I used and mine is a combination of a few of the ones there. I used 35% of the rudder area for the servo blade and balanced it with (most recently) 30% of it's area ahead of the centerline of the post. I have not experimented with tiller lines due to their friction. Most recently I have become aware of the 'Cape Horn" gear and like it very much. Look at their website for ideas. www.capehorn.com . The best advice I can give you is to have fun experimenting. I think the most difficult part was making the mount, for that I made up a mock up of the transom and rudder and bolted it to a wall in my shop. Good luck!

Hi Glen,

I also have some questions about your vane gear but want to be sensitive to your need to spend time with your wife.

You were kind enough to offer some encouraging words about the Paradox I built a couple of years ago. Pictures of "Raffles" can be seen on Bill's site as 'Mark Waters' Paradox'. Unfortunately, I have not been able to take the boat out much due to one personal crisis after the next. Hopefully, that is now all behind me and I can finish the one remaining project - building a self-steering wind vane.

I am wondering if you could point me, Rod, and anyone else who is interested to some good sources of information. I have found one site on the web - www.mindspring.com/~waltmur/Self-Steering . Looking at some of these designs I see some similarities with the vane on "Zoe". Is that correct and if so which design did you go with and did you make any dimensional changes? Also I was wondering if you have done any sheet to tiller experiments? I was happily suprised at how well "Raffles" tracks and could not help but wonder whether a more simple old fashioned direct vane (non servo pendulum) might work?

Many thanks,

Mark
