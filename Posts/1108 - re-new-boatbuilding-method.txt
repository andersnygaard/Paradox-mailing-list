Very interesting Antonio, for what application is the foam you use, used in the common market place? Where would we find it? The only urethane foams I know of are used in the floral industry.

Dear friends. I have a new boatbuilding method. It uses composite materials,
but in a very different way. I use urethane foam, very inexpensive and easy
to work with. The method is frameless and very fast, you can save a lot of
time, and you obtain an ultralight hull. I like to share this method with
your group. You can see my method on my page www.magallanesboatbuilding.com.
Best Regards 
Antonio Bordeu.
