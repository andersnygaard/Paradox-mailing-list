If you've ever sailed a boat with a tiller it would feel natural.

I am hooking up the rudder ropes and it appears when it is set up according to the plans when you pull on the right rope it turns left and pulling on the left rope makes it turn right. To me this seems backwards, any input from people who have sailed a Paradox. Maybe I have to many years flying airplanes
