Ok this is how to solve the problem about getting The Paradox Plans:
Every post office in the world is stocked with The Paradox Plans. Therefore anyone in the world who wants to acquire these plans simply goes to their local post office and asks for The Paradox Plans, whereupon they are presented with a set of The Paradox Plans.
