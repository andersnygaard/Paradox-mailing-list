Subject: Invitation to Paradoxbuilders2

We've been running up against a storage limit for our photos section in paradoxbuilders. With this in mind, and an anticipated influx of Paradox builders, sailors, and general aficionados, I've started Paradoxbuilders2.

Please continue to use paradoxbuilders photos and files sections as long as we have the capacity, and treat the new group as an overflow. It would be a shame to split the discussion between the two paradoxbuilders groups, so please continue to post on paradoxbuilders.

Please limit the new photos and files to those specific to Paradox, and other works by Matt Layden.

I hope that you will all join and contribute.
