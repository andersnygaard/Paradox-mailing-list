I believe Matt Layden carried a plywood patch with him on his PARADOX when he sailed down the intracoastal waterway and out to the Bahamas with us in 1994. One of the nice featuress about these little boats is that they generally can be repaired in the field without too much trouble. Matt once told me that he broke the rudder blade on one of his boats while out cruising, and he made a simple replacement out of a scrape piece of plywood he found laying on the ground nearby. Another time his yard splintered and he located a temporary replacement from a  tree branch. I think from now on I'm going to bring a 1 foot square piece of 1/4" ply along with some coarse 40 grit sand paper for more serious repairs.

On plywood boats I usually carry a little piece of plywood, epoxy coated with a few holes pre-drilled in the corners. A dozen torx drive screws and a tube of 5200 fast cure. Not the best repair but it will slow a leak way down until you get out of the water.

At least you got your trip in BEFORE the event.
