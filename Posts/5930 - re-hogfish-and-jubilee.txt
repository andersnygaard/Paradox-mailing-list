Chris Morejohn,

I believe the original Hogfish was launched in 1998, designed to sail the FL Keyes and when last heard from  is now located in Portland OR, and owned by a fellow named Matt Middleton.

Just over 30 ft. X 7 ft. beam, draws 2 ft. with about a ton+  of internal ballast. Has a swinging centerboard that when lowered draws about 6 ft. Ketch rigged with  leg o'mutton sail plan and flying a jib on a bowsprit. Not sure if it had chine runners?

Hogfish Maximus is larger at 38 ft.  and has chine runners, a daggerboard forward, and a conventional sloop  rig. No details of Jubilee, except for those two photos.

Chris Morejohn refers to these designs as "modified" sharpies, in that the topsides are much taller and have straighter sheers than the traditional sharpie.

No plans were ever offered for any of the three designs, and all three were sold.  Also Chris was asked to draw a smaller version in the 6 - 8 meter length size but never did. I think he has also designed some fishing boats, which were quite successful and mass produced but have no details on that either.
