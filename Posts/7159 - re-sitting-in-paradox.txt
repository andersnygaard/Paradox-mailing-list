Thanks for your reply Dave.

You have no idea how happy your reply makes me!  I have restless leg syndrome and the inability to bend my knees could be a deal killer for Paradox unless I can find a suitable solution to the issue.  A child's beanbag chair would do just fine.  May I ask you about what kind of head clearance you get under the hatch when sitting in your beanbag chair with the hatch closed?
