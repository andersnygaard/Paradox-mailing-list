Hi George.

Thanks for that.

Looking at the list the PARADOX 2 enlarged by 20% comes out at 16' 6" LOA x 4' 11" x 11" and a displacement of 2,321lbs as against my new proposed design of LOA 17' X 4' 10" x 10" x 1832lbs.

This illustrates the main reason why a yacht designer would draw from scratch if he had a new brief to design an enlarged version of an existing boat.

Although my design is 6" longer it comes out at nearly 500lbs less than PARADOX 2 with about the same volume and similar sail area.

Thanks for the link to the software but that is not the problem.

My Win98 computer does not have a CD writer and the USB ports have stopped working making me unable to transfer information to my main computer which has the internet connection and CAD software and graphic tablet and other toys.

I have just acquired a new CD writer so I will get that installed in the next couple of days along with getting the USB issue sorted out.

Thinking of T's new 30 foot boat. If he made it a cat ketch both sails could be of the same size and shape, carrying two spares thus doing away with having to carry a sewing machine kit plus a large bulk of sail cloth.

James Wharram's gaff rig wing sail would make an ideal choice with its easy reefing.
