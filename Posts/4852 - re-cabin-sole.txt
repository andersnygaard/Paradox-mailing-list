A stripped out Paradox without ballast or water should be 550 to 650 lbs. A little heavy for the roof of a car. Actually I'd say that Enigma is a little heavy as well. I.d say the limit should be 75 - 80 lbs, a little more perhaps if it is two boats. I regularly carry close to that amount in two kayaks. Two boats, each about 40 lbs is easy to lift up but one boat of 80 lbs or more is a bit of a job. The more difficult the loading and unloding the less likely you are to go boating.
