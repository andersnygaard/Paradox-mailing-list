Nels,
Yes ... for the first plan... Steve and I corresponded on this and he mentioned the original sail plan furled easier on the boom. Also we don't plan on racing our boats or anything and the increase in performance by using the new sail plan does not seem to balance against the furling ease of the old plan in my mind. I can always order the new sail later if I change my mind... an extra sail hanging out can't be a bad thing. :)
