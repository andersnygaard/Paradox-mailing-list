Oooh er, how did that happen?

I am certainly no expert in how the sail should set. It turned out that the sailmaker I employed knew little about lug sails and the sail, as supplied, was badly out of shape.

My comments about the cut-out were prompted by the fact that my sail developed a hole at the pinch between the yard and the mast and I solved that by extending the cut-out so that the yard bears directly on the mast without sail-cloth as a lubricant.
