Subject: Not to beat a dead horse... but size matters

Are there any completed or nearly completed Paradox boats currently in or around the Great Lakes? I would dearly love to see one and perhaps climb aboard to experience first-hand the accommodations. I love most everything about the design, but wonder if the boat would suit my 6'3", 250# frame.
