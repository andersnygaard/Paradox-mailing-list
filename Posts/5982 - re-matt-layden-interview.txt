It also clarified something I had misunderstood. I had thought the chine runners went the full length of the chine which caused me to see the rocker as being a problem, presenting a crescent to the water as opposed to a straight line, if the bottom was not flat.

An extract of the article is currently available at 
http://www.yrvind. com/present_ project.html
where Matt describes the function of the chine runner system.

Thanks for pointing that out Pete, very interesting. I hadn't 
appreciated what a big part the rudder played.
It was nice to see that my own interpretation of how it all works 
wasn't too far out.
It also supports my assertion that chine runners will not work on a 
multihull (though vortex generators may).
