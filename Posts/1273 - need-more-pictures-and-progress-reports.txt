While we are on the subject of pictures, how about some updates on the Aussie Paradox and Whisper, I know you two have been busy but how about taking a second and snapping some shots of your projects progress for the rest of us. Don I know you are lurking out there too and it would be nice to get some pictures of your completed Paradox as well, did you ever get around to naming her or will we have to continue to refer to her as Elliott's Paradox? How about anyone else who has started but not taken the time to share their experiences, woes and triumphs with the rest of the group, we need your input however trivial you may feel it is. Keep smiling, this is supposed to be fun, if you get bogged down and discouraged perhaps because you made a mistake on something don't fret.... take heart in the knowledge that a mistake is the first indication that something is getting done. Keep in mind that building a boat is like eating an elephant, if you ever step back and look at the whole meal you might lose your appetite. Just belly up and take one bite at a time, even if it is a small one, and one day your plate will be empty.
