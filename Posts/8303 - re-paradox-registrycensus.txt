Okay, I think the bulk of the Paradox registry info has been added.  I guess it is about 90% accurate, and about 10% incomplete.

If you use the Actions dropdown, the View can be changed to Slim, which shows all the columns.

I would really like to complete the launch dates.  There is less than a handful missing.  The boats without launch dates seem to be the most questionable, as to whether or not they were ever launched or are still around; other than 'Raffles' that is.  Would really like a launch date or estimated launch date for it.  Does anyone stay in touch with Mark Waters?

Thanks for everyones' feedback.  I didn't expect there to be this many completed Paradoxes.  Hopefully, a few more are added to the list soon (e.g. Quest, Mini, Planktos, Moxie, Manatee).  Good luck with those builds, and I'll slowly keep moving forward on Po.

I'm in OKC, and would love a chance to see Quest in Dallas, and Mike Beebe's new Paradox in Rockport.

For those interested, Dave Kaife is currently rounding the Gulf of Mexico via the ICW from Port Isabel, TX.  A link to his blog is in the Registry under the far right column titled 'Comments.'  It is an impressive voyage.  This guy is definitely making use of his new coastal cruiser.
