Subject: Painting ZOE

Glen, 

I may have ask this question before, but I can't seem to find the information; therefore, I'd appreciate if you could refresh my memory.

What kind of paint did you use on ZOE, and did you spray or roll it on? 

I'm considering spraying both Swamp Thing and Little Cruiser when I've completed their refits. Have you ever used an HVLP spray system like the Turbinaire?

Thank you.
