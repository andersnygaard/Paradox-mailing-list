Just had an update a few minutes ago, Dave.:

Glen Maxwell in Tao Zou at 0630GMT . 39=C2=BA 20=E2=80=99N; 26=C2=BA 1=E2=80=99W course  240=C2=BA.  

Estimate updated  for now, assuming he's maintained his average speed. Glen has less than 30 nm to go. 

Ha, best  bring out the beer to celebrate. Nancy has been on the Island for a while, patiently  awaiting his arrival..

Best
Jim
