Subject: Re: re enigma

Looking at the Matts video one thing has struck me. Enigma's mast step appears to be a plastic tube, about 3" high, faired and glassed to the bottom panel. She is not then fitted with a cabin/cockpit sole. The crew seems just to sit on the floor/bottom panel. If I am right, this would save a few pounds in weight. Anyone else notice that?

 It makes sense in a small boat of this sort to get the crew weight as low as possible.
