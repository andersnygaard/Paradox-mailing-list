Lexan (polycarbonate) is more resistant and do not suffer the effect of the sun, as with acrylic which becomes all cracked (cracked) with time. The windows are polycarbonate aircraft.

Hi Jim,

I've wondered several times about salt on the windows. This was a real problem on my Philsboat.  For my Paradox I was going to use clear Perspex, since I felt that tinted Perspex made the problem worse.

I guess the bonus with a Paradox, is that the side and back windows can be easily cleaned while underway.  Not sure about the front window.

Cheers,

Rob.
