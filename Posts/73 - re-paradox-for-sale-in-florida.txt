Hi Jeff,

No, it wasn't a misprint, $500 is the asking price, The sail was in like new condition and had I not just bought a sail that would have convinced me to buy it. The boats overall condition was GOOD pretty much plans built but steel was used in Lou of bronze on fittings. It naturally needs some work for that price but it is serviceable as is. I didn't probe the wood for rot but it was dry in side and looked to be in good condition. the glass on the out side had cracked in a couple of places but nothing major. The bottom appeared to have only one layer of cloth on it but appeared OK as well. It certainly is not a Crown Jewel but what can you expect for the asking price. I'm sorry now that I didn't take my camera so I could have posted some pictures. The boat is certainly worth the asking price but I already have 9 boats at last count and would rather see some one else get a good deal on it then to buy it just to try to sell it myself.
