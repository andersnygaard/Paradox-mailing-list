Subject: Re: Mast Hinged

Alberto- I have put a copy of the file I mentioned into this (Paradox) group's Files. Didn't think to do that until after I sent the first reply!! Duh!!

Hi Alberto,
Good progress on your boat!
If you join Yahoo group 'Junkrig' there is some information.
Look in Files on that group for 'Henpig3.jpg'.
This would need some special metalwork.
I presume you have seen Matt Layden's Little Cruiser tabernacle?
Cheers,
Alan.

Hello friends
The days Cachivache is to be launched. And  commented that a few blocks from my house I have the Chubut river in which to make interesting navigations.
The only problem is the low bridges and thought to make the mast hinged
Anyone have any suggestions or ideas how.
Thank you very much
Alberto
