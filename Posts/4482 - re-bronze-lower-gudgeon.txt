Subject: Re: Bronze Lower Gudgeon

I would say go for it,

The paradox was designed to be built from common affordable materials, cost most likely was a big factor for Matt, and tools, they cost money, or they take time to make, the wood and epoxy LG works and is cost effective, its actually a compromise for the best, being SS or bronze, If your skill and pocket can handle it, I would say go for the best you can afford, one could just as easy weld one up and epoxy the steel after abrading it, and that will protect it.

Are there any clear photos of making the lower gudgeon for Paradox? Don Elliott's photos aren't very clear and I wondered if anyone else had better ones. Also, has anyone cast a bronze gudgeon in place of the glass-filled one? Any reason I couldn't or shouldn't cast one in bronze?
