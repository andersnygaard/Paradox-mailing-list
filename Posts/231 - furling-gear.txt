Subject: furling gear

I don't have a lot of hours actually sailing Paradox, but I don't remember having that much difficulty with the furling gear. It seems to me that all I had to do to get the sail up was release the furling/reefing line and pull on the halyard while holding the boom up. Then, when I wanted to reef, all I did was ease up on the halyard while at the same time pulling on the furling line. Of course reefing is a two handed operation which requires letting out line with one hand while pulling line in with the other. I do remember there was some friction in the system, though, but it was not too bad. On the other hand, I have watched Matt raise, unfurl and reef Paradox' sail many times during our trip together, and he consistently was able to do it faster than Mindy and I in Little Cruiser. Surprisingly enough, we only take about 30 seconds to reef. Also I noticed that he was able to reduce sail going downwind in strong winds (20-25 knots), while we had to come up into the wind to do the same operation. Maybe there is some secret that we don't know about, or it's just him. I've told Matt about the Forum, but he is a very private person. Usually, I get to sail Paradox and ask him lots of questions when we visit him in Stuart at the end of our yearly trip. Unfortunately, we aren't headed South this winter. I do know that Paradox is in the water now, so Glen you might want to see if you could take a look at Paradox #1 and her furling gear. If you send me an e-mail, I can tell you how to get in touch with Matt.

Well, I don't know if this has helped any, but maybe we can figure this out.
