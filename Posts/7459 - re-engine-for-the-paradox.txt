hi Matt

I wonder what you're going to do with all this electricity? A display of flood lights?
Batteries are expensive and don't last very long and if you don't take extreme care to use always the correct charging regime and never to discharge them to more than a given percentage of their capacity their life will be even shorter.
They're not so 'green' and environmentally responsible as their made out to be. They contain a lot of very toxic materials and cause a lot of pollution during their manufacture and scrapping at the end of their life.

A solar panel on the foredeck would be Ok so long as it was tough enough to stand on because you'll need that space to walk on when putting up the mast.

Ideally a panel that you could take up out of the way when rigging the mast would be better. But there would be much waste of space as the foredeck is triangular and all the solar panels are rectangular.

I agree with you that a trolling motor used with a generator is a clumsy solution. All the disadvantages of having an engine with extra complexity.

Surely, the easiest method of alternative propulsion after the yuloh is a small out-board engine. I've just returned today from a week long sailing trip in my Paradox and during that week I used only one litre of petrol. I admit that I was lucky with the wind in that there was no period of prolonged calm during that week.

Best
