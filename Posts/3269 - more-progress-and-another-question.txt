Subject: More progress and another question

Today I made the yard. Took a look at my wood stock and realised that the boom with a dead knot could be cut down. The dodgy bit with the knot is now near the end and the knot is half the depth it was. I'm going to cut it out and fit a wedge shaped piece to replace it.

Questions: Is there any reason why I can't mount the yuloh in a standard oar socket? Has anybody any knowledge of the respective merits of 2hp Honda and Suzuki outboards?

Cheers...Derek
