From what I understand, Sven was hoping to create a mizzen sail that was attached to the rudderpost. The idea would work similar to an arrow in flight. With a mizzen sail up, attached to the rudder (and also with a sheet to tiller to adjust he small sails he has) he could gain a measure of balance. Don't forget, he's not exactly trying to just beat to windward, he is trying to weather cock the boat so that he can stay nearly directly into the wind and still make some kind of headway.

He then goes on to say that he was interested in making a rudder from a VX40 catamaran into the sail, instead of using a traditional sail attached to the rudderpost. Then he said it didn't work out somehow, but doesn't explain. He also didn't like any of his bowboard designs, and is goofing around with some canting mast options.

Its a lot of fun watching him try out these ideas. I wish he would post more!
