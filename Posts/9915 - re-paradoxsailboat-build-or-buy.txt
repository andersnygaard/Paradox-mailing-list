I've sailed my Paradox in bigger seas, a Yuloh is useless in choppy water. Without a Motor, you must be prepared to stay on the boat until conditions improve, take sleeping gear and something to eat (and read). The tidal flow here is strong and again a Yuloh is not going to do it. A motor is a pain in the A, the main sheet gets caught in it and the balance can be upset by a motor out back. I tried the most expensive electric motor, but poor range and a lot of it is easily broke in rough water. In a lake, a Yuloh is fine, I made a Yuloh and when I sold the boat, the Yuloh looked like new.

Motors: I have nothing against them, my background is all motor boats, but on a Paradox I find them unnecessary. I fully intended to fit a motor, but decided that for the first year I would do without, then I would *have* to learn to sail. The second year I somehow never got round to fitting it and the third I realised I didn't need it.

Several Paradox owners have commented how well I manage to get to windward. I have observed them put in a tack or two, then start the engine. They have never had a chance to learn to sail properly.

Motors as a safety device: I was once in a fleet of dinghies drifting in zero wind down an estuary. We came into close proximity with a ferry. All the boats with oars rowed clear. The one boat with an outboard tried to start it, and failed. By the time he got the oars out it was too late to prevent a collision.

Taking a tow: I have never *needed* a tow. Sometimes it is convenient or polite to take one if offered.
