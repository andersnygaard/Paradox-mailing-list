My second boat was a copy of Sopranino, the yacht that crossed the Atlantic with Patrick Ellam and Colin Mudie, which was designed by John Laurent Giles (1901-1969). The sailboat I owned was clinker ply construction fastened with copper roves with a ply deck. The chap I bought it from in Sydney had sailed it to Lord Howe Island from Sydney, Australia. I was never so adventurous, but I know the design of Sopranino well and consider it similar to Paradox, which I also know well, in terms of innovation and seaworthiness. If you pick your weather window carefully, don't sail to a schedule, and have similar seamanship skills to Colin Mudie, I think Paradox is equally capable of arriving at Lord Howe and getting you home again. Like it says in the book "Sopranino", written by Ellam and Mudie, "For centuries boats had been built as strongly as possible, to withstand the enormous power of the sea. But Patrick Ellam and Colin Mudie had a theory that if you built a boat light enough she would lift over the tops of the waves and so survive." They sailed 10,000 miles and you only want to sail about 1800 nautical miles.
