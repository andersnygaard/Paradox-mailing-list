I have posted pictures of the my progress. I made two pockets in my yuloh for plastic sockets. I machined them from delrin. I used a .750 dia. ball endmill cutter I bought a long time ago at Boing Surplus. I knew I might need it someday! The two pockets are 1 inch dia. and .625 deep. A single #10 brass flathead screw will hold them in place. I'm using brass so it may not scratch the steel ball. we'll see. The plastic will need to wear away .125 before it hits the top of the brass screw. I didn't show the ball bolt.

The .750 steel ball was drilled with a tungstun carbide drill to be mated with a .375 dia. stainless steel lagbolt, like the plan. I hope this steel bearing ball does not rust too easily. I brazed them together and polished up afterward. The high polish may retard rusting.

The first coat of varnish is on the yuloh now. The hull has all it's fiberglass on now and I can turn it rightside up tomarrow. The cabin is next. I'll need to take a trip to Seattle to get some Lexan polycarbonate for the windows. I hope I don't break the budget!
Cheers, Steve Yahn
