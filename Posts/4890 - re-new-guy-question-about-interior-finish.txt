I have seen similar coating failure in other applications. I am not a coating expert by any streach but I'd look fo a paint that is formulated to stick to epoxys. Another possibility might be to etch or score the surface of the epoxy prior to painting. I'd still want a coating with a UV inhibiter, and not just leave the epoxy uncovered.
