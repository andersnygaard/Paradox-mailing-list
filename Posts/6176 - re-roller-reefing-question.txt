I haven't followed this thread and may be off base but will offer this anyway. Excuse if out of line....but...
My 2 cents. Don't mess with Matt's roller boom, at all. You will not be happy. Until you have used it....you could not understand the nuance of all its functions.

Yes, thank you Dave, I did mean boom. 
d) and f) are kind of no-brainers, otherwise you wouldn't even bother. 

I guess what I'm asking is, why so many pieces? It seems to me that a simpler J-shaped bar or tube would do the job, provided it allowed boom rotation at the front and attached at the other end, via a short downhaul line, near the base of the mast. It would also need an eye to guide the reefing line.

Has anyone seen the roller reefing mechanism for Enigma? Is it the same as Paradox?
