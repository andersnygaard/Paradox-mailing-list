Looks like you're have a good time so far despite a little bad weather. What kind of device are you using to update your blog? I've been thinking of using our Ipod Touch to do the same on future cruises because it is very small and relatively inexpensive in comparison with a full sized lap top. Anyway, have a great time, and keep posting.

I started my cruise aboard 'Faith' five days ago. The log can be seen at

If you can't find it there you can access it through

I'll only be able to upload the log when I can use WIFI Hotspots.

I hope you will enjoy reading the blog.

Currently weather bound at Ramsgate - snow is forecast, but I have a Woolworths Hot water bottle - my trump card!

Cheers,
Bill.
