Jeff,

I think the whole thing about PARADOX is that she can be built by anyone with low woodworking skills. Steel, although stronger would be overkill adding extra design problems. Matt has sailed PARADOX thousands of miles and the boat is good for lots more.

An extra layer of cloth on the bottom is all you need.

Regards,
