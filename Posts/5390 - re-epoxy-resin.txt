Thanks Pete,

As I would have to drive an hour or order System Three online, I will probably finish with West System as it is readily available close to me and I found a place where it is cheaper than the Mas. But I have ordered about a qt of the system three epoxy and hardener for the water tanks.... I will be doing these per plan and manual. I used the small amount of Mas that I purchased for the beams and they are very strong, I guess it doesn't really matter which you use as long as you follow the mix and use instructions.
