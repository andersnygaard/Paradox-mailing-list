Subject: Re: Cabin Fans

The most modern computer fans are 6" diameter, and are very quiet.    
Cheaply built PC's are still using the older 4.75" or smaller designs.   Next time you see a new full size Dell PC, with the front grill, notice how quiet it is!

The one year old HP 620N I run as my home entertainment system  (running Kubuntu) even has the larger fans, running at low speed.   It's as quite as my Mac Mini, and my iBook G4.
