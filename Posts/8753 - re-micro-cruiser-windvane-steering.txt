No, I'm not in that Dave ... too techie for me. Being that I've been a Jester fan for years, I joined the Jester Yahoo Group and get a daily update from there. Ewen, Who's the non organiser, puts out his 'sitrep' every day on there. Some of the boats aren't represented on the Ocean Race Track site, though some have satellite phones.. I think that Ewen gets his info from a mixture of sources

Have you seen:
