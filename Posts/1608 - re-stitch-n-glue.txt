Phil Bolger says that some of the new window plastics are literally stronger than steel, so maybe their being stove in is more a matter of how they're fastened to the cabin these days.

Traditionally, blue water boats had smaller windows because they where a weak component of the boat (coasters, being closer to shore/rescue took more chances with big portholes - and more risk IMO). Wood/plywood blanks where/are a stock item to quickly cover a stove-in porthole. Generally, they're pieces of wood that will fit out the porthole "on the diagonal" (how done for a round one, I dunno. but it suddenly strikes me that oval portholes are a Good Thing, especially for a single-hander) and then held against the outside of the cabin by a long screw extending in from the center of the blank with a wooden cross brace that's tightened up by a big wing nut. If made and kept specifically for the purpose, some old bike inner tube on the inner surface of the blank would help it seal against the outter flange (spigot?) of the porthole. Reasonably fast repair in a storm.
