Subject: Re: anchor locker

DC,

When I build I plan on having an anchor well in the bow. The chain will stow under the front deck low enough to help stability, rather than adversely affect it. Since I haven't sailed a Paradox yet, I cannot speak for balance, but from my other boats I know that NOT having enough weight in the bow can cause a boat to be fidgity in any sort of chop.

I really scored a few months ago when passing through northern Virginia. I happened to stop at BoatUS when they were having an open box sale. I got a beautiful flip top stainless steel chain pipe for only $2.50 (normally $40!)
