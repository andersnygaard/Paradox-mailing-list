Thanks for everyone's replies. I think I'll go with the overlapping cleats solution. Probably put them on the aft face, so that I don't have to look at the filled gap, when I'm on the helm!

No reason why you shouldn't put cleats on either side of b'hd 3 and fill the gap with epoxy. Then console yourself with the thought that the epoxy is stronger than the original ply so you have just made the boat stronger.
