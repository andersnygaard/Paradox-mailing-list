Subject: Re: Video of motoring into shore late afternoon

Must get a go pro type action camera
I see so much when I'm sailing and I'm too busy to film
Hope someone is out sailing
I'm repainting my Stevensons Pocket Cruiser and building a pontoon style house boat
So it's all boat boat boat here
Will sail again soon in the Cruiser to test the mods I've made to her , and then get back to my Paradox
