Subject: Re: Questions regarding Paradox plans.

It looks like the boom could have about 8-8.5" off, and the mast
4-4.5".  I'm also planning on building to specs and trim if I can
after.

Don Elliot has done a coloured version of the mast plan that makes it a lot easier to 
understand. If you can't find it on his Paradoxboatbuilders group let me know and I'll scan 
it for you. Don is protective of his copyright so I'll only do it with his permission. Al Law of 
"Little Jim" fame has also written a good description of how to read the plan.
I'm almost afraid to start on the mast :0)
