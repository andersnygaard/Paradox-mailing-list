Well i have just recived my building manual via pdf files, printed and bound in a file. Have a warm open fire place, carpet slippers and dog by my side. Now for the next few nights reading and trying to place things in my head. 
I have also sent for the drawing and looking forward to seeing them.
Just hope i've not bitten off more than i can chew with this build.
Having only built a welsh coracle and now finishing a ken simpson kayak for my young lad. thats all my knowledge of boat building.

All the best Dave

Well, that's one more boat than I had built before I started Little Jim. 
Don't worry, all that is needed is the desire to finish the build.

Hoping for calm nights
