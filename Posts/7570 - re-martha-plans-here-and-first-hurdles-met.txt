If you use thicker plywood on the bottom and decks you could run into problems bending them. Even with the correct thickness ply it can be difficult. The solution could be to laminate two thinner sheets of ply together on the bottom. When Derek Clark built 'Enuf' he could not bend the bottom plywood without cutting it. He also cut the foredeck plywood.

When it comes to the chine logs, do them longitudinally in two parts epoxied together for each one. When I built 'Faith' I had great difficulty bending the chine logs and keeping them in shape with clamps until the epoxy hardened. Doing any bending of wood is best done when the air temperature is high, i.e., on a bright summer's day. The epoxy goes of quicker too. Pre-bending the bottom plywood with towels soaked in hot water can help, but make sure the plywood is absolutely dry before applying epoxy.

Cheers,
Bill.
