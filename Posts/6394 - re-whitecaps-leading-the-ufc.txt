Subject: Re: Whitecaps...... Leading the UFC

Correction to previous post - That was not the St. Marys River after all yesterday and they are still progressing northward. Matt is about 10 mi behind, in 3rd but is sailing now - so just might catch up. Manitou Cruiser was in the lead when he last posted but his latest spot not showing.

This was posted at 7:30 AM on the 18th March:

Wizard said, "Tide is with me for now, but not for long. I may stop for a nap, waiting for the tide to change." Matt said he is warm and toasty sailing from inside Elusion with the hatch closed.


At about 2:30 PM - Both Whitecaps (going 2.97 knot) and Manitou Cruiser (4.13 k) have moved past Wizard (1.77 k), in the narrow canal they are passing through.

I expect the first two are using a double-bladed paddle and Matt a single. Manitou took a photo of Matt as he went by.

They all hope to reach Ft. Clinch today and will be turning left into the St. Marys River.
