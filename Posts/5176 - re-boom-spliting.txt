I have already shaped the end of the boom to a spherical radius for just the reasons mentioned. I'm surprised that so many of you took Matt's meaning to use a machinery bolt. I had assumed he meant a lag bolt. I wonder how you call these in Briton. A bolt with big woodscrew threads, and a hex head. 

I had a large box of stainless 8mm bolts, so I tended to use a lot of 8mm bolts

On another note that trip to the Schilly Isles is impressive. It would seem scary to me. It must have been exciting. The honda got a lot of use. Yuloh-ing that far would be discouraging I suppose. If we hadn't had the motor there would have been a lot more waiting for the right wind. If you have a timetable you really do need a motor. As it was my first crossing I was glad to have company, but it is really a psychological barrier. I have done longer coastal trips without a second thought.

Before your trip there I had never heard of the Scilly Isles. It's spelt Scilly (They are very fussy about that) If you zoom in on Google Earth you will see that it only just exists.

I was also surprised that there is an actual place called Penzance. I thought it only existed in a musical. The real pirates lived a few miles down the road in a place called Mousehole (pronounced Mouzle). They got the writers to locate them in Penzance to fool the excise men
