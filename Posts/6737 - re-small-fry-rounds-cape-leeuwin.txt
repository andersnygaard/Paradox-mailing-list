Hi Geoff

Congratulations on your trip.
I lived in Perth for a while (White Gum Valley)and used to sail with a friend who had a 25footer at Fremantle.
We used to go over to Rottnest on nice days,but I don't recall anyone,even the big boat owners,going south of Bunbury.
To those who don't know,this is a surf coast without harbours.
Very adventurous of you!
Thanks for the photos too.
Cheers 
Neil
