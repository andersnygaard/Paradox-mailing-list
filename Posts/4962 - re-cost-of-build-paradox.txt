I'm no expert, just have some of my own experiences.
First; over time fiberglass does not completely keep water out. There is most often some water getting in that we are not aware of until the rot sets in. Second; when looking at fairly small boats, the cost differential between marine and exterior grades is not really worth the worry considering the overall project cost and the life of the craft. (IMHO).
Bottom line - I will use marine ply on my current and future boat projects.

Can anyone tell me what the difference in cost is between a dogs 
rowlocks top job build and an economy version?

And as the boat is going to be pickled in glass and epoxy, can I get 
away with exterior grade ply as opposed to marine plywood as I've read 
somewhere that both types use the same glues?

Thanks in anticipation.
