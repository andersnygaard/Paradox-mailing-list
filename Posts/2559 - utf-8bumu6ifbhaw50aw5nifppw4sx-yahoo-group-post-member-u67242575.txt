Subject: Re: Painting ZO+=CB

Thanks Glen for the quick reply, and the thorough answers to my questions. To be honest, I'm surprised that you didn't spray the finish on ZO=CB because when I saw your boat the last time the paint looked so beautifully and professionally done. In the past, I've used a foam roller to put on the inexpensive one part polyurethane paint that I use on Little Cruiser.  Unfortunately, it's not nearly as tough as the two-part Awlgrip that you use.  Nonetheless, this wasn't that big of an issue because the paint would crack anyway with in a year due to the checking plywood underneath. However, now that we are covering Little Cruiser in fiberglass, I'm hoping that our paint job can last a little longer if we don't hit too many things along the way.  Oh yeah, one last paint related question.  Do you have any recommendations for a hard antifouling paint that is suitable for trailered boats?  The only paint that I've use is Pettit Trinidad, which works well to keep marine growth clear but tends to get rubbed off when we bounce along the shallows or dry out at low tide. Maybe an epoxy/copper coating is the answer...
