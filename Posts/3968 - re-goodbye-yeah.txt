John, I am very sorry but I had thought that you wouldn't want the publicity .......... and I forgot you :0(

il add my 2 cents. could be you like fixing and building more. 

Very likely!

but when you say a 5 hour op could fix it, dont you think you sold off the best boat before you answered the next question

Yep, but I made the decision to sell and accepted an offer before the consultant mentioned cure! Anyway, I can build again :0)
