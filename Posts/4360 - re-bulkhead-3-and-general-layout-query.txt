Hi Pete. A little tip on handling plywood sheets. I use a 4 inch C-clamp for a handle, sometimes two. I will sometimes drag the sheet on its edge and carry the forward part with a C-clamp handle. As for the jig saw blade, look at the recommendations printed on the package. Fine teeth make smaller splinters. Good luck.
