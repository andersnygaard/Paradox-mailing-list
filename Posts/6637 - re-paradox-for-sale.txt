Its funny... there is so much information about building a paradox on the net you could almost build one without the plans... almost.=C2=A0 Anyway=C2=A0 Glen's site was informative to me in that it helped me make a decision as to which boat I wanted to build.=C2=A0 It was the stories provided in the links at the bottom of his page.=C2=A0 There are some nice pictures here but very little technical stuff.=C2=A0 Glen provides almost a complete build pic by pic on the paradoxbuilders forum as do a lot of the other builders.=C2=A0 The first thing I did was go to the forum's site and download all the pics and information into duplicate folders on my hard drive under the main folder paradoxbuild.=C2=A0 Then I ran a search on the web for "paradox sailboat" and found as many of the websites of builders and downloaded as much as I could find.=C2=A0 

Here is the link to Glen's Paradox Page. 
http://home.windstream.net/ifida/home.alltel.net_000001.htm=C2=A0 As I said, most of the build information is on the forum but this site provides wonderful inspiration and and information on "what makes paradox special".=C2=A0 It really helps the would-be builder understand how all of the separate=C2=A0components in the boat work together to make a complete cruising system.=C2=A0

This boat is absoultly terrifing to think about building at first.... (for me, a first time builder)=C2=A0 But as you get into it step by step it kinda teaches you what you need to know. (I know that sounds esoterical but well....) Also the support is unfounded for this boat.=C2=A0 Mainly by the paradoxbuilders forum community.=C2=A0 If I got stuck the first thing I did=C2=A0 was think up some keyword that related to my problem and then ran a search on the forums message board and read all the post related.=C2=A0 Then if I needed extra help I would post, and annoy the community, who totally ignored my=C2=A0crazy ramblings and provided the help I needed.=C2=A0 They are just this way... its great.... hope this helps.
