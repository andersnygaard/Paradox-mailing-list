Subject: weights and thicknesses

I built sailboats and larger plates with less thickness between 6mm and 9mm. I ask: is there a real need Paradox be built with slabs as thick or it could be lighter, with sheets of 9mm?

If the text contains errors, this is due to google translator, because I write in Portuguese. I hope the question is understandable really excited about the project and I intend to build this Paradox microcruiser.
