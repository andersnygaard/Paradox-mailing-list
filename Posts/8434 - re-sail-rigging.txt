Nick, could you send me a picture of the top of your mast? 

I have purchased the double pulley for the yard and one for the mast. The area gets a little crowded and I would like to see how you arranged yours. I am looking at mounting the halyard pulley just above the sheave on the port side. I see no problem with where to secure the halyard end at the top of the mast, but where should the topping eye or pulley be mounted?
