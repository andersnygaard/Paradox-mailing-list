I was looking at your pictures of the boom and have a suggestion, The main sheet and stock topping lift tang are not strong enough they will bend easily. I finally had to use 3 tangs bolted together to stop the bending. I believe Glen had the same problem, not sure how he corrected his.

It's looking good Bill, keep going and you will soon be there.

One observation about your rudder. I, and derek, found that with the rudder as-designed there was a problem with the lead of the sheet. On a broad reach, or when running, on the stbd tack the sheet drops into the gap between the rudder stock and the transom. Sail adjustments then require the sheet to slide over the top of the pintle/gudgeon. I found it advisable to make a small wooden insert to fill this gap and act as a fairlead. It is not essential, but it does make sail adjustment easier.
