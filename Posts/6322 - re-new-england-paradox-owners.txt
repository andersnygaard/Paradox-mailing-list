I'm in same boat--so to speak.  s New England, interested in seeing/riding in/sailing a Paradox.  Mine is a ways out--might start build in a couple of years.

Subject: [paradoxbuilders] New England Paradox owners

I had posted a message a few months ago to the same effect, and got a few great responses, but I thought I would shout out again and see if I can find someone:

I am planning on building a Paradox and would like to get the opportunity to sail one (or see one sail, or just see one) sometime before I begin my build.

Is there anyone in the New England area that would be willing to allow a young man to take their vessel for a spin? I would be willing to either pay, or do some household/ lawn work or other such. Obviously this isn't the right time of the year for it, but I would like to touch base with someone who would be so gracious well before the season starts back up. As I posted last time, I am also willing to trade someone time in their Paradox for some time on my 25 foot C&amp;C in Newport harbor in the spring. She's a great, fast boat, and would be willing to let an accomplished sailor take her our for a few days in trade for the opportunity to check out a Paradox and see what the design can offer.

Thanks for your time! If you do not own a Paradox yourself, but know someone near you that does (and who would be amenable to such an idea) please don't hesitate to contact me!

Thanks again.
