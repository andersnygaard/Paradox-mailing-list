Subject: Re: Mini Paradox idea

Hello All. Thanks to everyone who replied. Their were some good suggestions. I had seen the PDRacer before, but I could not bring myself to "sail" in something that looked like that. I really wanted something simple, but something that was a "real" boat to experiment with. I thought long and hard this weekend about the mini paradox, but I worried about it's minimal beam scaled down. Not being a nautical engineer, I did not want to take the risk.

But, I did start a boat project this weekend with the little time I had. I built a jig to build the thing on, and managed to get the bow and stern transoms and a few of the bulkheads built. This boat is a small plywood pram, with a v bottom. It's designed to be a rowboat. My mods are to make the first bulkhead taller (to the top of the sides) so I can mount the mast on it. To make benches on the sides, and not across it, and add a centerboard, and a rudder. The plans came from a book I got out of the library called "building classic small craft, by John Gardner". I have seen plans like this as a sailboat before. Actually, it's almost exactly the boat Ray had suggested below, it's just not a flat bottom boat. I hope to get all the bulkheads finished by the end of the week, and possibly get the boat mostly together by next weekend.

Thanks again for all the suggestions. It has been 20 plus years since I did even minimal sailing, and I have been on this group for a month. I have learned a lot just reading this list (and microcruising also).

Have a great Monday all!
