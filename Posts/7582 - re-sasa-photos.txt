Thanks or your input about water supplies and tiller extension. I was wondering about steering while standing etc.
Another thing concerning the aft deck; I want to design a two board seat at deck level, in the sliding hatch opening, to recline facing backward, feet on the aft deck (hinged or slotted washboard withdrawn) for reading or fishing when anchored.

I had considered an outside tiller, however in retrospect, I can't remember any time I would have used it.

I do have a tiller extension down below. This allows me to steer with my legs whilst they are either dangling when sat on the aft deck or whilst standing, normally when motoring.

I don't have built in water ballast but use 5x10 litre water bladders and full bottles/cans of beer.

I keep one of those bladders sterilised for emergency water, the others I fill with brine if necessary.  Drinking water is carried separately in 2L coke bottles.

Oh, also the above deck tiller I have made is able to be withdrawn.. to knock out crocodiles, pirates etc. so yes there will be room for other things on the back deck occasionally... unless cluttered with unconscious crocodiles and pirates.
