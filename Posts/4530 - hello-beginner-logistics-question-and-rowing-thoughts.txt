Subject: Hello, beginner logistics question and rowing thoughts

Hi,

I have had the plans for a few years and I am finally thinking seriously about taking the plunge. I have built a "lap stitch" round bottom dinghy and a flat bottom canoe (pirogue) from scratch and outfitted both for sailing. I enjoyed the building and I enjoy sailing but my boats are not up to the task of sailing where I would like, which is on larger lakes and down in the ICW (I am in Raleigh,NC). 

To work on the boat, I will have a bay in the garage, but I will move it in and out (keeping it in for a couple of days as required for certain operations) and the garage can be heated in the winter (I insulated it, so a space heater isn't as bad an option as it might sound). When I move it out, I have a covered area to store it in that is roughly 14'L x 5'W x 4'H. I plan to make a dolly for that. I think it will be tight, but that it will fit. Correct? The dolly may end up doing double duty; after completion I might use it to load the boat onto a tiltaway uitlity trailer for transport. 

I am curious if there is any way the Paradox can be rowed. I don't care if it isn't optimal. I have a lot of rowing experience and I enjoy rowing. One thought is to use forward strokes, alternatig like you are hitting a punching bag. I used to do that on rivers sometimes to cross flatwater stretches (I rowed rafts professionally for a while). Imagine a barstool on the floor of Paradox and extension arms that held oar pins about a foot off each side. I don't think that's how to do it, but that might give you the idea.
