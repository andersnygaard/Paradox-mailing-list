Well now - listen to my ramblings:-)

From where you live - and if you have time on your hands - why not grab a seat sale on a charter airline at some point and head on over there and hook up with your acquaintance?

I did that very thing a few years ago and had a ball in Maui. I booked day trips on snorkeling charters, rented a small car and a bike went to the top of Haleakaka, toured the island and stayed at my friends condo. I paid all the costs of us going out together. Win/win
