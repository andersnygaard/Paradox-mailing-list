Indeed, you are correct, Nels.

Commodore Ralph Munroe's sharpie, Egret, has a lot of after overhang. Because she is a fine lined double ender, with a flat bottom, she presents a long, narrow, v-section (nearly symetrical from bow to stern, too) when heeled. 

The reason Egret's WL lengthens is because at speed, the bow wave "re crests" at the stern (as all boats at displacement speed), subsequently wetting the entire (buoyant) overhang. A longer waterline does not guarantee increased speed, just the potential. Increased wetted surface of an overhang becomes a detraction. Someone may be able to better explain it than I, but I think it's fairly clear.

I emphasize "buoyant" overhang, because I have met folks who have been under the mistaken impression that a transom hung rudder counts as WL. 

A lightly loaded example of Paradox will indeed expose part of her bottom, both below the stem, and transom. Loaded to DWL, the boat will submerge the bottom, fwd, and all but a tiny bit aft.
