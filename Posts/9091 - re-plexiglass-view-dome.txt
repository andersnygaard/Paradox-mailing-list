Subject: Re: Plexiglass View Dome?

If the view from the inside is anything like my Robbsboat (A Michalak Knockoff of the Paradox) it's really not needed.

Hi All

Just a thought but I have never seen a Paradox with a view dome set into the hatch. Is there a reason for this.
I would have thought it would be a good solution to sailing with the hatch closed.
