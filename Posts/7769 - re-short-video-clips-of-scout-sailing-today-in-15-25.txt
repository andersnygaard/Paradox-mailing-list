Hi, looked like a great sail. 

As you are sailing on a lake I assume there are no significant currents. I only sail in tidal waters and there is always some current flowing. This makes it very difficult to work out what the true tacking angle is. What angle do you reckon you are tacking through in the various conditions?

This boat is truly amazing. Toe rail in the water is not an issue whatsoever...ease the sheet and she stands right back up. Downwind she flies. It was cold outside....I was warm enough that I ended up aiming the vent into the wind to get some air inside. The guys on the San Juan were amazed. I am amazed every time I sail her in challenging conditions.

You have to experience it to believe it. You are now doomed to go through life with people refusing to believe your sailing accounts.
