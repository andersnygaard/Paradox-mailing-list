I've been thinking about closed cell foam of the type used for camping mats. I have used it successfully in motor caravanettes in the past however, I've only seen it in 6mm (quarter inch) thickness so I don't know what, if anything, it will do for buoyancy.

I have some in 1/2" inch thickness but it is not cheap. Would cost a mint to get enough to completely insulate a Paradox. But it would really be warm:-)
