DC,

Thank you very much for taking the time to write a thoughtful and honest response. I agree, the highly evolved Paradox design does appear to be a distillation of years of refining through real world experience. Its seems all that is left is to have a equally evolved sailor. Something for me to aspire to!

Thanks again,

Blake
