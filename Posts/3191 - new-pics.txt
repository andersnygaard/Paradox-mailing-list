Hi all,

I've uploaded a few more photos in paradoxbuilders2/photos/paraplastic. One showing the remaining sail triangle after reefing. Has anyone tried to change the boom tapering to get rid of that triangle? Then there's one showing how my rudder finally turned out. There is 4 kg bronze now, which seems to be enough. There was lots of work to get the edge bronze covered. Finally, a couple from a short sailing this weekend in much too gusty wind. After the pics were taken, my wife got into the boat, then the wind just got worse and worse. We finally drifted into the reeds and could barely make it back to the jetty. With wind in the sail, trouble getting it down, the whole setup turning almost full turn round the mast, the metal pieces scratching the deck and window, also several scratches on the sides from the jetty. Then very hard wind (15m/s) from aft, skewly, when trying to get the boat on the trailer, pressing it to one fender (?) on the wheels, buckling it. Took half an hour to tow the boat up, standing barefooted in COLD water. And then that old lady came out yelling...

I think I'll start collecting stamps.
