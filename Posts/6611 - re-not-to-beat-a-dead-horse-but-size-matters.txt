I'm an American living in Taiwan. I really love the Paradox and have been reading about it for years.
I'm 6'3" and maybe 210. There's a Paradox in Taipei built by a Taiwanese man named Jimmy. I had an opportunity to go aboard the boat.
It's small for someone like me. Very small. I'm sure there may be others around that are our size that would say it is OK, but not me. The best way to describe it would be to say that it feels like I'm sitting in a toy.
I've always loved very small boats, but there are limits. There's nothing worse than admiring a boat, laying in a bunk, and seeing it was designed for someone 5'10" (most production boats).
There's talk on this site of building a larger Paradox. There may be one or two who have done it, but it's not well known.
In a couple of months, I will move to Thailand where I will have a lot of time and intend to build a boat. Either I will go with a larger Paradox (my first choice), or choose a different design.
