Thanks for the tips DC, I hadn't thought about stiffing the yard. I do have some carbon tows laying around some where and I just might laminate some to the top of the spar as you suggested.

Al, your question about telltale placement is one which will undoubtedly get a lot of comment. Everyone seems to have different thoughts on the subject. I have found the leech to be the best place and is one reason I fly my ensign from there. When the air is leaving the leech smoothly your sail is usually powered up just right.
