Hi James,

What is the diameter do you think? Looks like a neat little grill on its own.

I tend to go along with Al's thinking. All one needs mostly is to take the chill off in the morning and maybe again in the evening. I have a little candle lamp that holds one of those "survival candles" and it throws off some significant heat as well as light to read by. It was designed in case the power goes off in the home. Even has a drawer under with spare candles in it.

Another option might be to arrange a holder for two or more candles to be lit at the same time. Smokeless dripless candles of course.
