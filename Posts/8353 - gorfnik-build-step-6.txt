For those of you following this thread, thanks for your patience...

Decided to paint the inside of the boat before putting on the deck. Two coats. Later, when finishing the paint job from inside the boat, I was sure glad I did. Possible, but not much fun painting a ceiling which is only 18 inches high. Of course I did not paint the spots where glue was later to be needed, especially the three port and starboard uprights- rear and front cabin framing, as well as rear back-rest framing.

Before painting, I added a piece of 1/2 inch plywood at the rear to accommodate the rudder fittings, and also a cross piece at starboard right front, where the yuloh holder will need to be screwed down. Then glued and screwed in the seat supports too.

Note the notch at the back ends of the two seat supports. Their purpose is to hold the seat when flipped into a back-rest when sailing from below. I did that on my Paradox as well.

Glued down the deck with PL Premium, held with a few stainless steel screws.

Next day I cut out the cockpit space. Note that I left the front corners round and the middle front one inch back from the center framing piece. This provides for two convenient small shelves. At the sides, I also left a 2 inch shelf which serves as elbow rests while sailing. At the back, the shelf extends 3 inches from the rear transverse deck support, to allow for a small sloping cubby to store odds and ends. Like on the Paradox, this all-around shelf collects window-condensation water if any and prevents it from dripping down into the boat.

Hope this is clear. See 3 new pictures at the end of the Gorfnik album
