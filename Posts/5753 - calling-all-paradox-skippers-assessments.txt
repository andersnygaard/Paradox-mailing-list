Subject: Calling all Paradox skippers: assessments?

There are a lot of skippers out there who have been sailing their boats for at least a season or two, but few seem to contribute regularly to this forum. I suspect that most builders who end up selling their boats drop out of sight pretty quickly, leaving those not satisfied with their boats under-represented. 

I would like to see as many Paradox skippers as possible weigh in here, judging their boats against their needs, their expectations, and against their past sailing experiences. Was this the right design for you? If not, what would you build/buy instead and why? What are the plusses and minuses of sailing a Paradox, rather than other boats you've owned? If you modified, how did your modifications work out? What would you have done differently? 

I am also interested in the size debate: do you wish you'd built the stretched version, or (conversely) does the stock boat accommodate you better than you expected?
