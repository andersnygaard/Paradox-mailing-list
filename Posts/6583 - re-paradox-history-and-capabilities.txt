Subject: Re: Paradox history and capabilities

Ah, the topic, "Coastal vs Blue Water" is very informative.

I'm new to this group, microcruising, and the Paradox --

What are the design requirements of the Paradox and what does its history suggest regarding open-ocean (bluewater) safety and comfort?

Thanks
