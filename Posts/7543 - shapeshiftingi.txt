2004 Matt posts his improved sail shape and mentions the minor problem of it not furling perfectly. Matt says in his original plans 'taper boom as shown - this is critical to correct reefing and furling'

I just wonder, for the new sail shape to furl perfectly shouldn't the boom shape be new too, be tapered accordingly. Maybe the higher peak of the new sail just makes things difficult all round. But perhaps changing the dimensions of the boom slightly would allow the new sail to furl completely. If so, does anyone know what the new taper dimensions of the boom would be?
