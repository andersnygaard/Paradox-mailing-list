Ladikan launched at last

A couple of weeks ago my Paradox hit the water for the first time.
It has taken me two years of learning, problemsolving and carpentry.
Two fine years. I call her Ladikan which is an old swedish word for
the little box. (spelled with two dots above the first a). As you
can see on pictures in the photos section I have modified the
cabin. It is in two parts, the aft part movable. No longer young
and agile I was worried about getting in and out of her. That's not
the only deviation from plan. For instance I have used screws
instead of ring nails which I couldn't get hold of. And I have
excluded the water tanks and the lightning protection. I'm in favor
of simple not to say rude solutions and I don't care much about
finish. But this group, your messages and pictures have been a
source of inspiration for me. Thank you all! For instance I've
tried to copy Zero's wooddesign of reefing/furling gaff. So far I
have not had the opportunity to test Ladikans sailing capacaty. I
have launced her a couple of times in the lake Malar but
unfortunately (?) we have a stable high pressure weather with hardly
no winds in the inland. But she behaves very reassuring in the
water. I had her weighted on the trailer without ballast and the
equipage weighted only 420 kilogrammes. Minus the trailer it should
be around 300 kg. My leadpigs had to be made up with sandbags to
get her down to the DWL.
I'm not yet used to my digital camera and to sending photos on
internet but I can see that my first trial has landed. I have some
more pics from the building process if anyone is interested.
