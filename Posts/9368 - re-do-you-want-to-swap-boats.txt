Subject: Re: Do you want to swap boats?

It's just for fun really as I have the sails and they're new and idle as it were. I bet the lug sail outperforms but there is one on the web page in South America with a Bermuda rig. Hi f it happens I'll post it, right now I'm building a 7m long by 2.3 metre wide house boat, that has my full attention as winter is coming and I need all the bespoke windows in soon to keep the rain out.
