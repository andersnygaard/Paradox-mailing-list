Hi Al.

I can remember when I took the photo' in Cowes of you and LITTLE JIM with the Union Flag in the background, there were two 40 foot yachts moored the other side of your pontoon and they arrived about 1/4 hour before you.
They had taken a battering in the storm force winds and lumpy seas in their crossing from the mainland. There was three 40 footers that left and one turned back because they thought it a bit rough.
The crews were a bit taken aback when you told the you had arrived just before them.

Back to  jmichalsbr's problem of a PARADOX for two.
Not to long ago, Dave and Mindy posted small scale drawings of LITTLE CRUISER on their MICRO CRUISING TO THE BAHAMAS site. I think they also posted them on the Yahoo forum as well.
I always thought there was enough information for someone that knew about boat design to draw and build a copy of their neat little boat.
But I have for some time thought I would like to design and build a larger version of PARADOX for two and have come up with a 17 foot version which would be a lot lighter than one scaled up to 16 feet. To keep the displacement down I followed the ENIGMA/NOLI concept and just took it a bit further.
If you look in my NOLI folder on the Yahoo Microcruising Photo section there are a couple of drawings of the hull lines and ply panel layouts for my ramblings.
At the moment this is just a pipedream.
We all need these type of moments.
