Hi Bill,

A couple of days ago I went to my local Maplin Electrical store and found the Rolson Cushion Floor set. The set consists of 6 sheets 600 X 600 X 10 hard-wearing foam, with a tough outer skin, suitable for industrial use, like placing on a concrete floor while using a metal turning lathe or working on cars in a garage etc. It's also water and oil-resistant, and warm and comfortable to kneel or sit on. Not forgetting, no-slip.

I bought a pack to glue to the cabin sole on NOLI. The pack only cost just under =A310, bloody cheap, for which there is more than enough for a PARADOX or NOLI.
