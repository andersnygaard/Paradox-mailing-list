Subject: Re: depth finder

Do you really require an electronic depth finder?.

We are looking at a boat that draws around 1 foot and thus can clear 
most obstacles without much intelligence on the part of the skipper. 
Before looking at any electronic gizmo's to aid your navigation, 
being competant in coastal navigation is a requirement. eg. reading 
your position off charts and assessing distances from obstacles.

I really question the need for a depth sounder in the Paradox, the 
best depth sounder is the "slowing" of the boat(glue effect), swans 
standing in front of the boat or just read the charts.

The designer has shown that this craft can be sailed great 
distances by sail and yuloh, he cringes when an outboard is 
mentioned.

Horses for courses.
