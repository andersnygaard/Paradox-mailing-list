Well every one, I'm off to Philly for the birth of my 2nd grandchild so will be away for a week or two. I would ask the assistant moderators to take care of new member requests and would like to wish every one a wonderful holiday if I don't get back in time. DC, I'll be taking my laptop and hopefully will have some time to work on some build manual input while away. I'll check in when I can from a remote location. Have fun everyone.

Tailwinds

Glen
