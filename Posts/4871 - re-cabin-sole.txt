Hi Jeff &amp;al
 
Just out of curiosity, what if anything, does NOLI stand for? Sorry if
you've said it and I've missed it.


Enjoy

Hi Nels.

I forgot to add that on NOLI, it is 3 layers of cloth just past bulkhead
No 3 and 2 layers to the transom.
This was after a conversation with Dave when he said any damage always
happened forward of LITTLE CRUISERS lowest point.
I expect others will bear this out.

As a comparison, Paradox plans call for a 3/4" ply bottom plus 3
layers of 24oz glass for a total hull bottom thickness of about 1".
	
Three reasons:
	
1. Ballast - The heavy bottom adds to self-righting ability even
without the internal ballast.
	
2. Stiffness - without having to add stiffening structure inside - in
order to prevent "oil canning."
	
3. Safety.
