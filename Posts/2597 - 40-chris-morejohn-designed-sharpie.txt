Subject: 40' Chris MoreJohn designed sharpie

I just bumped into this "for sale" listing at http://www.mermaidresearch.com for a 40' version of Hogfish. I think what makes this Chris Morejohn design so interesting is the "Paradox" style chine runners which can be viewed on two of the pictures.  Incidentally, the photographs can be enlarged by clicking on them.
