Subject: Re: Hello :o) In new here.

The main sheet is one item I have pondered over for many a long hour. It doesn't seem like it's in the most logical place and it's one of those things which I have in mind to alter!

Now Glen Maxwell has moved and rerouted his main sheet to stop it fouling on his self steering gear, and he has more or less gone for my intended set up (mine would have a couple more blocks but similar routing). I think with this arrangement, fouling of a motor would be reduced considerably and is a much less cumbersome and with less friction especially when sailing well off the wind.

Glen's photo of his arrangement is here:

with his comment:
-------------------------
New main sheet location. There is a turning block located under the deck. Any water entering here will drip into the baffle below and out the tiller thru hull hole.

Glen, if you're around would you like to comment on your new arrangement, pros or cons?

I did a temporary fit of the fore and aft decks today. That foredeck is hard work to get into shape. I still haven't got it fitted properly up towards the stem. I'm thinking of cutting a groove about 3mm deep and 400mm long up the centre line with my circular saw, to allow the deck to bend a bit easier. If I do this on the outer surface I'll fill and fair and then cover in glass anyway so can't see any problem.
