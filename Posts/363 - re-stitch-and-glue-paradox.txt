Subject: Re: Stitch and Glue Paradox

I feel that there are many advantages to stitch and glue construction beyond any weight savings or non-use of chine logs, that would simplify Paradox construction. For instance, bulkhead construction would be greatly simplified. Much of the bulkhead framing would be not required, and also all of the precise beveling would be eliminated. Parts in general to not have to be precisely fitted in stitch and glue construction, as they do in normal framed construction. Any loss in weight could surely be made up in ballast.

As far as bending of 1/2" plywood, if anyone is familiar with Sam Devlin's various projects in stitch and glue, I can't see that it would be much of an issue. Paradox is basically a box. So many more complex hull designs have been constructed in stitch and glue than paradox with fine results. I feel that it is a construction technique worth looking at in Paradox, it just has not been done yet.
