OK I am installing the rudder. It is weighted as it is supposed to
be....and there is a v groove on top for the line to lift it. How
about keeping it down??  Are you guys finding just the weight is
enough to keep it from trailing back?  Seems like if I have the nut
loose enough to allow it to fall....it swings so easy that I can't see
how it would not swng back as the boats speed increases. Are you guys
doing anything to keep it in the "Down" position? 

Nope, gravity does fine for me.

One trick I found, hang a weight on the uphaul (I use a spare 
shackle) where it is horizontal along the tiller. If (when) you cut 
it too fine and the rudder hits the bottom the weight will take up 
the slack and stop the uphaul jumping out of the groove.
