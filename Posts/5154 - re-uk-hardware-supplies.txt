There is a danger here, Jeff. While we were in Scilly, Bill had a problem with his hatch. He had laminated the curved beams from ply rather than solid wood and the forward one started to delaminate. On investigation it turned out that it was the ply itself that was delaminating, not his epoxy joints.

So I would recommend that you put nails/screws through any ply panels, and don't rely on the original ply glue to keep your boat together.

Hoping for calm nights
