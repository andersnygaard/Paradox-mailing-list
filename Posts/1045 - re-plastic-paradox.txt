I think it is all very interesting myself, and have read about the voyages. I have a great deal of respect. But at the same time wouldn't discount other approaches. I'm more in the multihull camp myself, but if I was planing on taking a small boat way "out there" crash surviveability and positive floatation would have some appeal in a ballasted boat.

I think the story about the motor cuts two ways, a tendancy to go a little overboard comes to mind. On the other hand, with my nissan acting up, he may have a point.

Having been to Sweden I think a little rightful pride and ardour would never be out of place.
