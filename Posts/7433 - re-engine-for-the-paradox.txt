Subject: Re: Engine for the Paradox

You know the project Michalack, "Scram Pram" ... ? This design offers many advantages, it is simple to build, is 16 feet and 2 feet wide, the same type of candle is led inside, however the cabin is much more spacious and can be opened to the fullest extent. For your project, could be more appropriate than modifying the Paradox.
