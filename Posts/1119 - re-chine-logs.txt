I had the same problem, I laid one baton the length of the chine runner and filled in with bits and epoxy to get the shape. Fitting the permanent ballast there would be a neat idea.

DC, why not fit the sheer clamps first, then think how much more difficult the chine logs will be. Good luck.

Remember, if you fit foil faced foam (sides and roof) it will block radio signals inside the cabin, so the gps, for instance, would not work well inside.

Hi DC, When I got to the runners I found that all three dimensions were changing over the entire length of run so to make the task easier I made foot long blocks to rough shape and glued them to the ply bottom extension. It took very little time to do this with a band saw and once complete, only minor fairing was required with a mini grinder and 24 grit disk. I am now thinking that a mold made from a section of the chine runner and then used to cast lead for ballast would be a good idea to get the ballast out of the bilge and out farther on the lever arm. The lead could be bolted (hardware bonded) to the chine log. Just a thought.
