Subject: Enuf

Following an enquiry in another group I took a look at my photo file So-So and found to my surprise that the building has moved on a lot further than I thought in 6 weeks.

I've posted another picture showing her today but no close ups, or interior shots, because there are too many embarassing mistakes that I don't want to parade!

As she is now named Enuf is it possible to change the photo file name from So-So?
