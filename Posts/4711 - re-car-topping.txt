Subject: Re: Car topping?

Hi,

How about using thick flexible polythene for windows? This would make the cabin pop up for car top carrying. I have a Vauxhall Zafira MPV which shall measure length of tomorrow. 

If made out of 1/4 ply with plastic water containers for ballast 80L and could use gaff rig off summer breeze, would be great fun. Could try pop up roof on summer breeze first. 

Would be similar to day dreamer a 15ft summer breeze with higher free board and decked over. 

Yours,

James
