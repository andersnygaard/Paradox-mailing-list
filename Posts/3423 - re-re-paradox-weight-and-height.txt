Then you must also remember the ingenious Isetta
bubble car - had one of those. But surely the cabin
of a Paradox is bigger than these things?

Completely off topic, but something I found very funny
today. An acquaintance who happens to be an airline
pilot, actually loads up his household waste in
plastic bin bags onto his airliner - they are allowed
to bring so many kilos of stuff- to export it out of
the Country.

Only the non-re-cyclable waste you understand. He
reckons it's helping the Country......

Ye gods.
