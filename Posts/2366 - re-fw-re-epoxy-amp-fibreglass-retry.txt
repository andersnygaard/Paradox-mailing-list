My Paradox has just completed its second season. Anyone who knows me will be able to tell you that I do not cosset it. This weekend, between the rain I gave it was a quick looking over to see what needed doing over the winter. I was surprised to find that the only area that needs attention is on the bottom and that only needed attention at two places, near bulkhead 3 and up to a couple of inches in from the sides. This is the sum of numerous groundings on mud, sand, gravel, stones and rock. I am not sure at first glance if it needs more than the paint touching up.

I will probably give the whole boat another coat of paint, mostly because I didn't do a very good job of covering it in the first place, but it certainly wouldn't do it any harm to go another year without any external maintenance. 

I should have said I went for the 'glass all over' as in the plans.

Hoping for calm nights
