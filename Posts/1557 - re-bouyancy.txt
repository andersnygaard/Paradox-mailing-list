Now, lets make it confusing again:) Adding boyancy foam will not raise the waterline, it will only effect the flooded state of the boat, with very little added total wieght to the boat. However, adding ballast, in this case, steel or lead, will lower the vessel in both cases, what we are working to is those numbers that your asking for :) at this point we are fleshing it out so to speak.

remmember offhand the numbers but thats how it works. different materials have 
different boyancy "ratings" 

Thanks to Jack &amp; Bill for your help. That is much clearer in my mind.

I am intrigued by the thread about building in steel. Here in middle England steel is 
much easier to come by than marine ply, and paying a welder must be quicker than 
me building in wood. Has anybody been able to work out the weight of a Paradox in 
steel?
Would it be practical to consider the bottom, sides and stern in steel with a wooden 
deck?
