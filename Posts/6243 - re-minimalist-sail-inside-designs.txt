Subject: Re: Minimalist sail-inside designs

If you kept the length to 8ft you would lose displacement.Everything is a compromise.I sometimes go boating in very unprotected waters when the sea is calm and the forecast good.A good compromise for a boat so small maybe something pointed on the waterline and flat above,like Sand Flea or John Welsford's Sherpa.Really though,boats like this are not something you would want to go far from land in,IMO.Illusion is designed primarily for exploring where the water and land meet.
