Thanks. I hadn't considered the fact that normally you spend more time with your head out of the cockpit rather than buttoned up.And it's not as if I'm hopping in and out every ten minutes.

The dimensions for a proposed footwell makes getting up from the worst case condition feasible, although not as easy as it would have been 50 years ago.

Another question is nagging me. I've looked at pictures of Paradoxes from all over the net, and I have yet to find one that shows how the boom is secured at the mast end.  I've seen several that show the fitting connecting the boom to the deck, with a line leading upwards to a somewhere off the picture. I have difficulty believing that the deck fitting is the only thing holding the forward end of the boom in place against the wind.
