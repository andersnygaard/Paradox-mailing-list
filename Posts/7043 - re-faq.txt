Yahoo groups do not have a place for FAQ files.. but there is a HUGE amount of information in the Files and Links sections of the group. There is still a lot of information in the Old Paradoxboatbuilders group started by Don Elliott. Check FILES and Links in there too. I dont know how long the group will remain up since Don passed away. All his wonderful drawings are one reason to go there.
