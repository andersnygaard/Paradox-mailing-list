Hi Pete.

Welcome aboard to the gaggle of UK and beyond PARADOX nuts.

I live down on the Isle of Wight and have met up with Al a couple of years ago at Cowes, and been onboard LITTLE JIM.

Although I have not sailed with Al yet, I believe in the old adage, if it looks right, it is right. And PARADOX is right.

I think Derek Clark lives a bit nearer to you and he has just finished building ENUF and has sailed along in company with Al this summer.
