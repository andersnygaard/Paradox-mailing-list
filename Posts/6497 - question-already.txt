I have the plans and the build manual, but don't see the answers.

Question: When I attach the floor timber to the bulkhead, should I have the bottom edge flush with the bulkhead? I see "Bottom Bevel Standing" on the plans and it looks like the floor timber extends below the bulkhead, but I don't see where it tells me how much.
