Subject: Re: Double Rudders


Yes, I thought of this one and agree with you about the drawbacks.

I was wondering about the Bolger concept of having a rudder offset, 
it need not be offset all that much to allow room for a windvane on 
the other side of the transom, but there is still the hurdle of how 
can the sheet be led away from the stern.

Having sailed single-handed mostly around UK coasts since 1958 I've 
come to value the use of any self-steering system.  It's even more 
important for a lone sailor coasting because it allows time for watch 
keeping, navigation, cooking food, which I do underway - a proper 
meal, usually prepared in a pressure cooker.  Most of all, it 
relieves the tedium of steering for long periods.  If one wants to 
sail from Dover to Brighton, a distance of 60 nautical miles in a 
day, holding the tiller for 12 to 14 hours is no joke.  I fear in 
Paradox, that time could be more.

Cheers,
Bill.
