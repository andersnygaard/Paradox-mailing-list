Hello Steven-
I'd have to agree with you about how beautiful and appropriate Puget Sound, the San Juans and Canadian Gulf Islands are for cruising. Particularly in a Paradox! My last job before retirement was as First Mate and Relief Captain on the Schooner Zodiac which you may be familiar with. Her home port is in Seattle on Lake Union, but her Spring, Summer and Fall port is Bellingham. She's a great ship, but at 160 feet over all with a draft of 16 feet, we were limited in the places we could go. I used to look at some of the delightful little coves and beaches and wish we could lay up in some of them. Still, being the "tallest hog in the trough" as the owner used to say, was a lot of fun, and I have good memories of my five years with the ship. Once my shop is complete here in Montana, I'll be starting on a "Paradox" myself. Maybe the extended version. I saw some of your photos and you do very nice metal work. Very professional.
John

Thank you very much Bill. I have recieved a boatload of help and good wishes from you and everyone here on the list. It is much appreciated.

How has your boat been holding up? Is there anything you would do differently if building again? Regards, Steve
