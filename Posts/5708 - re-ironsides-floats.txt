Thanks Al.

Thanks for that. Yes I agree that a braked trailer certainly makes manouvering a lot easier. We had an unbraked trailer tent which was about 500Kgs and we had a few fun times with that on sloping ground!

I'm having discussions with my neighbour at the moment about building a trailer (he's got all the welding kit and has built a few in the past) and I've been offered an old caravan chassis for donor parts. We'll see what turns up. I do like your trailer which, I suppose, is really a mobile slipway. It certainly makes for easy launch and recovery.
