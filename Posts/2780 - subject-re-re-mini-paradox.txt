I think you're right, John.  It doesn't look like a lot of curvature,
but there's some.  I don't know if the curvature is essential, or if
they have to follow the chine to be even with the hull bottom, or if
maybe the runners are built along the chine to serve the secondary
purpose of strengthening the boat.

By the way, Glen, do you think any of the MiniParadox's speed was due
to the slight V-shape the bottom was tortured into, at the bow?  I
remember you said that Matt was unimpressed with stitch and glue
construction, but I guess forming that slight V was somewhat easier.
