Subject: Re: Lexan

Bill I used Plexiglass which is more scratch resistant than lexan but not as tough. I have had no problems with mine and it is a fraction of the cost of lexan. Look in your local yellow pages (if you have them over there) for plastics suppliers and workers, often times you can get drops or damaged sheets at a considerable savings.
