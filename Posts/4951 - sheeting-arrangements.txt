Subject: Sheeting arrangements

Your right. It only works if you're logged into Yahoo groups. I was 
trying to be too clever!
Any way the photo can be found in the files section under 
Zoe's Vane Gear

All good points Al, and you know a lot more than me about sailing 
Paradox than me! As you say, most of the ideas you had wouldn't have 
turned out any better than the original design. I think it's all too 
easy to look at changing things,which don't need any modification. As 
you say it's probably easier just to build as per the plans and make 
a few changes once experience tells you otherwise.

I'd still be interested to hear Glen's comments on his sheeting 
arrangement and whether it helps stop the fouling on his vane gear, 
which is a lot more obtrusive than a motor.

I see that Bill has also fitted an engine. Have you rejigged the main 
sheet?

Cheers
Pete
