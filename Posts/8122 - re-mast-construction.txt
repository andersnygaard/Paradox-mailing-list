If Lezlie's page that Matt pointed to does not sort it for you this may also be of help.

There appears to be a minor error in the drawing.

On the line labelled CL (centre line) are pairs of dimension arrows, 6 in all. Take some correction fluid and paint out the right-pointing arrow heads, they should not be there.

Note also that the "Section At Deck" is only a half section that should be mirrored about the 24mm dimension line. The lines below that are a continuation of the side view.

Hope this helps
