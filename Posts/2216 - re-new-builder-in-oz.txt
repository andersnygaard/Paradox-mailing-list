Hi Shane,

My plans are already in metric. Makes it much easier as I don't think in feet and inches.
I didn't specify metric plans though, I thought that was standard for Paradox.

There is an easy conversion program for free at http://www.joshmadison.com/software/convert/.
This converts most units into whatever you want and it's pretty small.

Sounds like the Aussie fleet is growing.

Just wondering how you are getting on with Australian metric plywood and US Paradox plans in Imperial measure. That is, how are you doing fitting inches and feet into cms and metres?

p.s. I have a set of Paradox plans and live in Canberra.
