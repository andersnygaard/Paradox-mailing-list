Subject: Re: Yuloh


David,
I, too, was perplexed by the 30mm. If you take a look in the Photos section at picture number 2 under "Swash", there is a picture of a yuloh being laminated. You can see that it is being bent as it is being laminated..much like the deck beams though not nearly so sharply. It is my understanding that the 30mm is the deviation near the center of the yoloh from a line drawn from one end of the yuloh to the other. In other words, the curvature referenced is along the length of the yuloh. I think the picture under Swash is worth a lot more than my words.

Hope this helps.

Steve
