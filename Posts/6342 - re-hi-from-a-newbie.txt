Basically, since all sharpies sail mostly on one chine.. when heeled they extend downward and accentuate the tracking of the chine forming a sort of pseudo-keel. It works VERY well on the paradox and I suppose any flat bottom boat of around that size. In the water, they help the way bilge keels do on many British boats. Andrew

Howdo all,
My name is Charlie, and I have just joined your group after coming across the Paradox in some discussions on another small sailboat group, of which I am a Moderator. I am in the Southwest of the UK (Devon), and at the moment I have a Silhouette that I am in the very slow process of converting to junk rig.
Initially, I would like to ask a couple of questions, I can't quite figure out how those bilge runners work, nor how they prevent the Paradox making excessive lee way???
Best, Charlie.
