Thanks Dave, 

I dont have an exact count on how much ballast I was carrying, but it did sit on its water line, but thats not 9 inches and she felt a bit tender, we had a few heavy plastic bags to grab sand with but we really ran out of day light and we just got to beat to wind for about 8 tacks and then went with the wind back, I felt she needed more and would preform much better. hopefully I will get her out again tomorrow and spend some time trimming her up. It is amazing the wake, and how she feels for such a short beamed boat. I still have to install the rear window and was concerned about a following condition, boy was I wrong!!! hahahhahha also I made a rubber boot for the tiller hole, worried about waves crashing in, as I did not put the curved baffel, I built a square one and mounted a cam cleat on it, but im not liking to reach in for it. Also one big thing that has been said and rings true is the fact that the boat once trimmed up she will STAY that way without fuss for long periods. she is everything I was looking for and then some. 

Jack
