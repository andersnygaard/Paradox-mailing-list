Subject: Re: Minimalist sail-inside designs

Sorry-One never knows who has seen what.What struck me from the video was how well the boat appeared to be sailing.How about configuring with the cabin at the rear and a flush deck forward?Don Elliot designed something along these lines.
I understand what you say about apartment dwelling.You can(or could)get light trailers that came apart,but doing this everytime you sailed would likely end up being more trouble than cartopping.Would you store the boat in your apartment when it wasn't in use?How would you move it from your car to its storage spot? I guess it would involve putting the boat on its side which would exclude having a solid cabin,unless you made it detachable.
This idea of a minimal covered over boat has interested me for a long time.
