Hi

Welcome.
I've had a look at your web page. Ithaca looks lovely. Where is it?

I reckon that I am two weeks away from finishing and launching. Bill Sergeant is making 
amazing progress, and who else is there building?

Hope all goes well.

best wishes  ...  Derek

Subject: Starting a Paradox in Ithaca

Hey everybody, I'm a long-time lurker who has finally started to build.  I'm writing to let 
you all know that I'll be keeping a (hopefully detailed) build log at http://
www.math.cornell.edu/~noonan/boats/paradox.html

If you are curious, you can also see a little blurb about the other boats I've built at 
http://www.math.cornell.edu/~noonan/boats : two Yost-designed folding kayaks and a 
PDRacer -- not nearly as complex as Paradox!  I'm moving to a house on Cayuga Lake this fall, 
so I've got to round out the fleet with a microcruiser.  Not much room to build at the 
lakehouse, so this summer is a bit of a race to get as much building done as possible.  My 
two brothers will be joining me in July to help things along.

I'm sure I'll have a thousand questions as this build comes along, so thanks in advance for 
letting me pick your brains.

Matt
