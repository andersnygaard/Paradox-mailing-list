Sounds great Bill. Keep us posted. Have you seen the Micro yet? If not be prepared for a bit of a shock - I was. It is a lot bigger than I imagined. 

If you go to the Bolger4sale homepage - that is me with my back to the camera and my first live view of Lestat. It was commissioned for a man about 6'4" I believe.

My thinking was to build Enigma for soloing, rather than Paradox. Reasoning? Lot easier to handle on the hard - lighter to tow - and it comes with training wheels! (Just kidding about the last item.)

An Enigma prototype type is being built, from which the plans will be developed at some point.

But you already know that as I see you posted to the group.

I am thinking of it as an Austin Healy Sprite for sailing. Have a convertible top with maybe a removable hard top.
