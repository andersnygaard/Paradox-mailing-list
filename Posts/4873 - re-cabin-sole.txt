If Paradox gets beached stern first, the corners either side of the 
transom are vulnerable to wear, although adequately strong to 
withstand quite a battering.  Stern first on a pebbly beach is not 
advised because the base of the rudder can get thumped.  I learnt 
this lesson last year and I'll take care not to allow it to happen 
again.

The reason why I went in stern first was to get a good night's sleep 
by trying to incline the sole of my boat so that my head would be 
higher than my feet.  Going in bow first on a fairly steep beach 
means that if you want your head higher than you feet you have to 
sleep with your head nearest the bow.  That I don't like doing 
because the base of the vent box gets in the way of my head.  
Therefore it makes sense to find a gently shelving beach, and if 
circumstances allow get the boat as horizontal as possible.

Cheers,
Bill.
