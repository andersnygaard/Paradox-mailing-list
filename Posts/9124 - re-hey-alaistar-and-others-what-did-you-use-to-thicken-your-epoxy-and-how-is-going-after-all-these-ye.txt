If you want lots of volume you need good quality microphones :-)

Use Cab-O-Sil for structural work. I attacked my Cab-O-Sil filled 
resin with a sanding disc on an angle grinder. That works well but 
you need a good respirator and a hat as there is a remarkable amount 
of dust

Sail when you can, row when you must, motor only when you have to be at work in the morning.
