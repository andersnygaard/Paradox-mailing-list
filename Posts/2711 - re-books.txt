Hi Nels,

Nice to hear from you again. 

38' is a bit larger than I was thinking and I was hoping for the more instructional type of book. However, if we are extending it to more general sailing, but still small, then I must include Shane Acton's "Shrimpy" books.

Read Swedish? I have trouble with American :0)
