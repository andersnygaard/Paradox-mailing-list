Hi Martin

On the River Severn the trows were pulled back from Gloucester, against the current, to at least Bridgenorth by teams of men using the towpath. They used to fasten the tow rope to the mast; I've seen one illustration with it at the top of the mast.

On the canals horses were used and pulled from a point just back from the bows on the centre line. Later motors took over; cheaper to keep going than horses or men and more reliable than both.

With the best will in the world I don't think a yuloh is going to take anyone very far down a canal over a period of a week. I personally can't do it because of diabetes; I'd be loading myself with sugar and taking blood tests much too regularly for my own peace of mind. I think that I've read that a reasonable rate for a yuloh on a Sampan is 2 knots. 4000 yards an hour isn't going to take you very far. On a river going down stream may be different, but then I'd guess the yuloh becomes a steering device and we already have a rudder. 
Having said that, I would use a yuloh to pass a fishing group if they felt it better for them than the motor. No point in falling out with them when you can only go slow.

Where are you building?

Cheers....Derek
