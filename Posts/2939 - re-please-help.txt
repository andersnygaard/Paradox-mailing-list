Jeff,

Chill, Bud! This is a wooden boat project. A labor of love. You can't hurry LOVE! Grinning. Or so She said. The boatbuilding will be done when it gets done and not one minute sooner. Some say a wooden boat is never done.

You would be better served today by knowing what the plywood requirements are and where you are going to get SUITABLE plywood. If your answer is, "Oh, I'll just pop over to Home Depot and grab some CDX.", good luck. On the other hand, if you plan to use marine plywood or premium grade MDO/HDO, you may have to have it shipped to you. Where are you anyway? Somebody here could point you to plywood sources. You'll need some lumber too. Epoxy. Fasteners. Sail. Know where to get that stuff?

Buying plans is easy. Sourcing materials can be a challenge.
