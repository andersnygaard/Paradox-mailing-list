Hi,

I'll do the bigger group first in case I can only do one. (I don't know about this)

The Group.io info says I need to be "...either the Owner of the Yahoo group, or a Moderator with invite and promote privileges."  Do you have the permission to grant me the latter?

(Eyrie of Astoria sounds like a great project too!)

Thanks,

Matt
