Hello everyone,

I hope this email finds you all well. Today, I'm excited to share with you all that I'm officially starting my build for the Paradox sailboat. As some of you may know, this past month has been quite eventful with a water heater replacement that unfortunately caused a flooded basement, and burning four days fixing it after work. 

A few weeks ago, I ripped 6mm oak strips for beams at a friend's shop. However, I have now decided not to use them since the verdict varies widely if white oak will hold up to epoxy/laminates. Instead, I bought a saw-stop portable table saw and will rip them tomorrow and Monday! 

The saw-horses have my beam jig pattern laid out on the ply. I was initially unsure about how long to make the beams but after measuring with a Batton (the curve) 55" will give me 2.5" extra on each side of bulkhead #4 curve which is the longest one. I'll make them all the same then cut to length. 

I'm located at the Paradox build shop in NE Ohio where my wife is cool with me taking over the garage, as long as I remodel the kitchen "now that I have all the tools!" I wonder what I've gotten myself into!

Best regards,

Erik
