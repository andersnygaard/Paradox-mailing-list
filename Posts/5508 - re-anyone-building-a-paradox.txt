Wonderful. Steve Y


It is a Brompton <http://www.brompton.co.uk/> a Brtish design that folds quickly into a very neat package and is comfortable to ride. It has 16" wheels, which is what limits how small it can fold, but that's the smallest wheel size I thought would be safe. I wouldn't want to ride a bike with smaller wheels, although I did look at one with 6" wheels which folded up ever so small <http://www.a-bike.co.uk/>. But what happens when the front wheel hits a rut??

It takes up a lot of room in the forward stateroom, but I have never used half of the available space anyway. I will report back when I have taken it for a sail and seen how the installation performs.

Hoping for calm nights
