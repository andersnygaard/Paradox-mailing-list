Subject: Outboards and fuel storage onboard Paradox

Bill and all,

I have been reading for the second time Gerry Speiss's account of his west to east Atlantic crossing as well as following Bill Sergeant's cruising blog aboard Faith, both of which I'm enjoying immensely.

In Gerry's book he makes notes about his distress at the odour of fuel in the cabin space of Yanky Girl despite the fact that his fuel cans were not leaking. I read that Bill has recently lost the filler cap for his Honda outboard overboard!

All of which prompted my cuurent line of thinking about the location of fuel on board Paradox.

As I'm at the pre-build stage at the moment, it would be nice to design a space in her stern for fuel storage but avoid the smell of fuel in the cabin.

Could fuel 'bins' be built in the port and starboard quarters much like the water tanks in Paradox's design, where filler caps and vents would be placed on the quarter deck and sealed off from the cabin space?

Bill, how are you finding this situation aboard Faith? How are others dealing with it aboard their micro cruisers?

Greg
