Hi,

Hope you're on the water now, and the winds are fair.

I have an open boat, one that has a rear cockpit, a Stevensons Pocket Cruiser, it would have sunk, it's the same length as a Paradox and a lot lot wider.

It has flotation tanks under the cockpit seats but it would have swamped as the wave turned it. Then bobbed about getting smashed on the rocks as it sat upside down proud of the water. The flotation tanks allow me to hang on waiting to be rescued somewhere above the water, if the tanks weren't holed. I never considered that in a freak wave event you would be pushed along, like a bulldozer blade, laying side on, in a half rolled position, powering ahead under wave pressure, carving up water and trying to scoop it into the cabin. More sailing experience needed here. Would not take an open boat where I take my Paradox.

The recovery was positive and sudden, as soon as the wave washed under the hull, Pop! Up it came. I hope I never get to see the full capability of its righting moments, it should roll upright from way way over 90 degrees to vertical, but let's not ever go there ever! Inspection revealed nothing, the boat, built strictly to plan was still solid and everything was untouched, just wet.

Sail away and I hope your shoulder heals quickly as you relax in your boat.

Nick
