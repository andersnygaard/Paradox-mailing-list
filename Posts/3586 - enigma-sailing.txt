Subject: Enigma Sailing

Anyone wondering how a 12 foot boat with a square sail and no keel does heading upwind against a current, can see how Matt does it here during the Ultimate Florida challenge.

You page up or down until you see the comment quoted below and hit the dialup or medium button to view the video. Notice the wake line as Wizard sails directly towards the camera.

Unfortunatly Chief does not seem to have a wind filter on his camera - nor do any of the other cameras it seems. Makes it hard to hear the commentaries.

"Chief - Wizard arriving and departing Fort Clinch. Watch how easy it is to strike, set, and reef his sail. Also, learn the Wizard Shuffle :)"

I think the "Wizard Shuffle" refers to easliy and effortlessly Matt gets underway as he is leaving.
