Absolutely!
The sheeting goes a little way towards alleviating the problem but it
doesn't fix it.
The long boom means the sheet passes   aft of the transom and ,
particularly in a gybe, will catch around the engine cowling, gear lever
etc. at will.

The only way round this is to modify the outboard.

2 years ago I added 3 pieces of plastic conduit to prevent the sheet
falling in below the engine cowling and help to "glide" it up over the
engine. This was an experimental and temporary measure, however it worked
so well that it's still there today!
You'll see the arrangement in the photos below but I can take close ups if
that helps.
