Hello friends
Appeal to your experience and expertise to consult on a question to me has emerged.
In all the pictures and drawings of the Paradox I have not seen that leads stays or similar.
In this area the winds usually blow with great force and unexpected bursts.
What stays in place?
Kind regards

No stays,

You reduce the sail. Lower it by rolling it onto the reefing drum. If you look at the pictures that came with the plans, Matt is sailing in some strong winds, the sail is reefed in. One of the Paradox's strong points are that this can be done without having to go out on the deck to do it.
