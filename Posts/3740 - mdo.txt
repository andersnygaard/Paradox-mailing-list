In addition to the link regarding MDO at Olympic Panel Products in WA state, here is what the Canadian Plywood Association has to say about MDO.

I would consider it possible to build a Paradox without using any cloth or epoxy except to seal the joints and it would last a long time. However adding some glass up to the waterline might be useful for abrasion resistance. But even then, a good coating of antifouling if on salt water or epoxy with graphite powder would work too. So long as one is not landing on rocks a lot.

Some of the exterior house/porch/floor enamels are surprisingly weather and scuff resistant these days and provide a nice semi-gloss finish when applied over MDO just using a good brush or foam roller.
