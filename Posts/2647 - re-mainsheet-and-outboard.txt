Hi Derek.

The mainsheet angle is the angle the mainsheet leaves the transom to the end of the boom. If you lessen this, ie, make it more horizontal, this will make it harder to pull the boom into the centre of the boat, as in being hard on the wind.

I have added roughly a horse to one of Matts drawings to give you an idea. It is not to scale. This picture is in the photo section.

For all the complications of installing an outboard motor I would be inclined to stay with the yuhlo. Matt did several thousand miles with his. But then, we cannot de-invent the clock. If one has an outboard motor installed it would be used more than it should. They are noisy and smelly to. A motor plus bracket and one gallon of fuel weigh about 55lbs on the back end of a Paradox. Nasty. As for the cost? A yuhlo will cost about $15 to make and weigh about 5lbs stored amidships. Good. A bit of gentle exercise never hurt anyone. You could always pay someone to scull for you while you sit on the fore deck sipping a G@T.
