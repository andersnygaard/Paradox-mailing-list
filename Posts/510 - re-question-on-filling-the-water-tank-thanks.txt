Thanks Glen!!

It's pretty much up to you Roger, I posted some pictures in the files section under plumbing and also under construction of how I did it and in practice it has worked out well. One thing I didn't count on was the benefit of being able to drain the tank by putting a hose on the spout and pumping a few strokes until the water siphons out the hose which is led overboard thru the vent port. If you look at the water fill and drain picture you will notice that the drain stands proud of the hull, this is done so that the water will drain without dripping down the hull and leaving a stain. I put a funnel in the fill when filling with a hose/jug and fill until I hear water gurgling out the vents.
