Subject: Re: Bulkhead 3 side cleats? Deck Beam dims and BuildBook

Yes, this is correct. The side panel glues (and nails) onto the edge of this bulkhead

The deck isn't a radius, more like a parabola. Use the dimensions on sheet 7 (bulkhead 2) to make a mold and laminate all the deck beams the same. These are then cut to length for each bulkhead.

The roof beams are made the same way, but the curve is defined on sheet 10.

I added a BuildBook folder in the file section, to post building notes.  I am still in the planning stage, haven't made any sawdust yet.
