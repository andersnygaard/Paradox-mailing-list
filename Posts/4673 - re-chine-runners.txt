Thanks to everyone for their advice and thoughts on the matter.

I like your idea Jack, using lots of little blocks would probably use up a fair bit of the scrap off-cuts of timber I have, which aren't really any use for anything else.

I'll decide how to progress when I get to that stage!

Jack, in a previous post you mentioned you used 12oz Biax on the bottom of your boat. Did you use just a single layer. I was going to use 600gm biax (which is about 20oz I reckon), and was wondering if I needed 2 or more layers. Matt specifies 3 layesr of 24oz WR if my memory serves me right.

Today I took advantage of the fine dry forecast to join the bottom panels together. I've had to do this outside because there is not enough room indoors for the operation.
Cutting the scarfs has been a huge job. I broke 2 blades on my power planer, and took all the edges of my hand planes. My grinding wheel has been working overtime for the last few evenings. As the ply I have is Far Eastern marine ply, I've nick named the bottom the "Beast from the East". I've had to name it something because I've spent a lot of time sweating over it and giving it a good talking to!

With luck I should be in a position to fit the bottom next weekend.

Pete
