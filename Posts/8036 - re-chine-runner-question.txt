Subject: Re: Chine runner question

I don't ever recall seeing a video, in fact as far as can I remember Matt
only modified one chine runner on Paradox as an experiment.
He found little improvement on the original if I recall. (Search the
archives if you have time)

Enigma and Elusion both used higher aspect CR's but of course the Hull and
Rudder are still the primary parts of the overall system.

Here's a video of a model with higher aspect ratio CRs but also narrower
beam and more rocker, so where's the improvement coming from? :-)
