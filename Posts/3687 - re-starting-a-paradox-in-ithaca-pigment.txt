Subject: Re: Starting a Paradox in Ithaca / pigment


One question: you used pigmented epoxy on the hull, right?  Does the pigment protect the epoxy from UV, or are you varnishing or painting it over as well? 

No paint. The epoxy supplier insists that the pigment prevents UV degradation.

Those forest green Paradoxen sure are pretty... is there a reason behind all the green boats with red sails on that side of the pond?

Forest green??? That's British Racing Green!!!  :0)
As for the red sail; one of the best colours for standing out against the sea. I want to be inconspicuous up rivers with the sail down, but very conspicuous if I'm in trouble at sea.
