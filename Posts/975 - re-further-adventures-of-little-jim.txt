Congratulations to Al on the completion of LJ, and the informative log reports from recent outings. The Paradox design appears indeed to have many good points. Could Al comment on the helming position - it crossed my mind that sitting facing forward, but with a lean to either port or starboard could become uncomfortable after a period of time. Is that how it works, do you have to brace yourself against the cockpit sides, or what? Best wishes for future voyages

Remember in a Paradox there is no cockpit. Usually I sit in the top corner of the cabin with my feet braced against the lockers on the other side, but it is worth remembering that with all that ballast there is scope for moving about without upsetting the boat. On some long tacks I settled into the bottom corner and found that quite comfortable too.

That said, after 15 hours I was beginning to think of wedge shaped seats and bean bags and small inner tubes and suchlike ideas. I had even tried kneeling down (on a garden kneeling pad) for a while to get the blood circulating again. 

Cushion development is definitely on my list of things to do. Does anyone know what Matt does on the longer voyages?

Hoping for calm nights
