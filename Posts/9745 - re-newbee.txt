Hello Steve,

I have a a paradox that is about 1/2 complete. I am building a paradox to tour the bruce peninsula. I have lots of experience on the great lakes, mostly lake huron and georgian bay. I am a dinghy sailor. I am aware of 2 paradox that have sailed one on lake ontario and one georgian bay. I also know there is an enigma 360 hull somewhere in southwestern ontario. I am not sure if it was finished. Feel free to ask any questions you may have.

Best regards,

Cory
