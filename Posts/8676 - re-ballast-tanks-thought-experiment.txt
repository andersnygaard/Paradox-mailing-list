I am not convinced that the idea of filling with rainwater is really practical. You would need an awful lot of rain, or have to be very desperate for water.

If driving water into the tanks directly from a hose make sure that the vent pipes are big enough to take the full flow. I have vent pipes about 2mm diameter. Once I was filling the tank, holding the end of the hose close to the deck fitting and pointing straight at it. When the water reached the vent pipe it could not escape fast enough and blew off the inspection cover!
