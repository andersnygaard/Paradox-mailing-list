Ha!  I love the Furled Sails podcast!  I'm the lunatic with the "Orange Peril" canoe on podcast #69 (the very last email)

I really like the "flotilla" idea - 2 or 3 small craft, travelling together.  That seems much more fun than having a single craft.  You could easily keep in contact with VHF or just consumer walkie-talkies.  I may just have to build two identical boats. :P
