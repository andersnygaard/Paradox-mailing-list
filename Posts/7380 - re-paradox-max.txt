Subject: Re: Paradox Max

Hello,

I have noticed that the Paradox Max has a great weight in relation to its size, which seems strange for a Paradox boat. For example, the Tiki 26 has a catamaran constructed of laminated plates with 6mm glass fiber fabric of 330 gr, which is very strong and lightweight. So, my question is: Would a Paradox built with 9mm laminated plates be enough to create a boat that is both strong and lightweight? 

Thank you in advance for any insights or suggestions.

Best regards,
