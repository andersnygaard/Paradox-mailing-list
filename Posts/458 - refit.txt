Hi All,

I'm finishing up the painting today. Should launch next week. I have been shooting some video of the refit, and got to thinking, what about getting the shake down cruise on tape. Sailing. Cooking. Sleeping. To show what cruising in a Paradox is all about. Anybody interested in a copy?

In my part of the country, when you want to sail, the wind never blows. But when painting, the wind blows like hell. Go figure!
