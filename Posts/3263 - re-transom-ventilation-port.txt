It would also be difficult to get at in rough conditions.

If I wanted to have a port I could open while at sea I would get (or make) one that hinged at the bottom and arrange to operate it with a line from inside. This would have the added advantage that, if it was only opened about 60 degrees, a following wave would wash it shut rather than wash in. (Though I have never had any water come in the tiller slot)

It is worth remembering that this hatch doesn't have to be watertight as any water that does get in is directed out of the tiller slot by the baffle.
