As a non-sailor I have been delighted with the performance and ease of sailing. I had intended to spend this year sailing on the sheltered waters of Poole Harbour 'learning to sail', but I got on so well that I have already ventured out on a 26 mile coastal trip. Look at my web site www.asjg.clara.co.uk/little_jim/little_jim.htm and read the trip reports for my impressions.

In general the answer to all the questions is "Yes, it works"

Alastair: I am very new to the group and to this design. It caught my eye immediately and I am very curious about your opinion of Paradox and its sailing and handling performance. Are you satisfied with the design? Does the specified rig work well? Does the lack of a keel hurt performance at all? How do you think it would perform in heavy winds? Thanks for the great pictures and the inspiration. Richard Green, California, USA
