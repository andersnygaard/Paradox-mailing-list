They are hiding at the bottom of the photo section, refresh the browser
on the page and it should work. these photos are from my phone camera,
not very good. I am making good progress considering we are experiencing
a tough winter, it takes a lot of heat to get the temps needed for epoxy
work. hopefully I will get to starting the floor. right now it's easy to
stand inside the 2 hull halves and work. considering I do not have the
building notes construction is a bit slow as I must think out my
procedure on my own. Sheer clamps were installed last night, chine logs
go in today. I have not had to use a claw hammer or the dead blow
mallet, but I'm looking forward to it ;)
