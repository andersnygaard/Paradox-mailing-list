Launched my Paradox today,

We put in at Gaspee point R.I. Narragansett Bay, the exact spot where the Hannah led the tax ship the HMS Gaspee aground in USA's first blow for freedom, in 1772, on this date, 9/11/04.

We started out in aprox, 6 inches af water, poled out a bit with an oar and started out with a NE wind at about 5 mph, very calm sea state, took 3 tacks to learn the boat and lost ground, beating to wind. after a few mins of trim we came about away from the boats in the cove and made for open bay, once out in the open bay and in the wind correctly she took to doing what she is hailed to do, beat to wind! and points very well! after about 1 hour of tacking upwind and drinking champange:) and the sun setting we made back the the ramp, letting her go with the wind, as a barge and a tanker were leaving the port of providnece, we figgered lets see how she handles a large ships wake, nothing but joy!!! very easy motion. She is everything shes said to be. to me not even enough time to get to know her, but so far a joy!! 

As we approched the ramp there were folks standing there waiting for us to arrive, all interested in the cute lil lug rigged sharpie, first comment was, uh..... VERY very short beam, what is that??? nothing but kudo's and comments, its worth the work, looking forward to the next sail, hopefully il get out in the next few days and report in!! she is named in my wifes honour, Jill baby!!! yup Jill and Im Jack!! cant wait to get back out!!
