Wow - that is pretty exciting stuff Al!

First - that you were able to drop the mast in those kinds of
conditions. Then it still kept moving, which perhaps confirms that the
hull itself works as a "lifting body" which is what Sven Yrvind has
claimed with this type of hull. Combined with the momentum from a
relatively heavy displacement.

When you consider the amount of experience Sven has - crossing the
Atlantic a few times in small boats - and how much praise and
appreciation he gives to Matt's design work - what a great
confirmation this is to a very low key humble guy!
