Hi Kjell,

Can you give us the laminate schedule for the hull? Is there just one layer of Dacron and what is its weight? The use of Dacron is curious as that is what is used for peel ply but I guess as long as no one is trying to peel it off it will be fine. Back in 1984, I covered the wings of my glider with it and then used epoxy instead of the usual covering process and the fabric is as good today as it was back then.

Tailwinds,

Glen
