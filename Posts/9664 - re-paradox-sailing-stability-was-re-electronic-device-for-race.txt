Easy, you just attach the photos to your message. I'm talking about sailing in a seaway, not on some placid North American lake. In the kind of places I sail in NZ, there is no way you are going to be standing! If you look back through the message history on this list you will find many instances where the earlier builder's considered the standing lug to be broke, hence the use of topping lifts and similar devices to aid them when roller furling. The Mk 2 came about because an early user was disappointed in his Paradox's windward ability. My biggest problem with the standing lug was safety when gybing (nothing is holding the boom down, so you end up with a Chinese gybe) and pathetic windward performance on starboard tack, because the roller furler does not provide enough downhaul tension on the luff, which bowed badly when not supported by the mast. There were other more minor issues too, that moving to a sprit rig solved. My response is you don't know how other sail plans might work until you've tried them. If you look at Matt Layden's boats, you see he is always trying out new ideas on his boats. That's the spirit I like to emulate, trying new things to see if they're an improvement.
