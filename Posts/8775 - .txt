Subject: Re: Repairing a hole in plywood hull

Hi William,

Your idea sounds good to me, but perhaps you should use plastic instead of newspaper. Otherwise the glue will seep through the newspaper and glue your temporary plywood to the boat.

From the little I can see from the photo, it doesn't look like the damage is too severe. You might even get away with just filling the hole with thickened epoxy (after wetting it down with unthickened epoxy), placing plastic on it and shoving a board up against the whole thing to hold it in place while it dries. To hold the board on tightly, perhaps wrap some straps around the whole boat and hammer in some wooden wedges under the straps. Or perhaps use a car jack between the supported boat and a fixed object such as a tree.

Good luck with the repair.
