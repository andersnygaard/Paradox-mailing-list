Subject: Basic interior dimensions?

I'm thinking about a Paradox for my next boat, but before I spring for plans, I wonder if anyone would be willing to find me some basic numbers? What is the length of the cabin sole, bulkhead to bulkhead? What is the maximum width of the cabin sole? Could much more useable width be gained by eliminating the side bins, or would the center frame simply be in the way anyway? What is the height of the cabin, sole to ceiling? I am 6'2" 200lb, and would like to be able to occasionally cruise with my son. I understand the design can be enlarged 20%, but I don't know what the trade-offs would be, nor how difficult it would be to modify the plans this way.
