Are you familiar with Sailrite? Lots of people make their own sails. I have made several... It is not that difficult, particularly a sail of this type!

Hello all,

I am at the stage in my build of wanting to have a sail made. I am looking for any recommendations for sail makers that have made a good and proper sail for the paradox.

Thank you and best regards,

Cory
