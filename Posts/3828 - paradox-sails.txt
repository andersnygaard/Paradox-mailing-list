Subject: Paradox sails

I'm currently talking to a local sailmaker (Douglas Fowler) about making the modified Paradox sail. We are trying to figure out why the sail has sleeves instead of lashings to the yard and boom. Is there an advantage in terms of the reefing system or the kind of cruising Matt designed her for? Would it be a bad move to omit the sleeves?

As for the hull, the roving is now on the bottom of the boat. I shudder to think of how many dollars in epoxy it took...
