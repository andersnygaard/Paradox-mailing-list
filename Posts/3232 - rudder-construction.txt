Subject: Rudder construction...

Hi,

Like other aspects of Paradox, the rudder is a bit different from the 'norm'. Most lifting rudder-blades are sandwiched between TWO cheek pieces (on the stock) which take any side-thrusts. Anyone got any comments about this? I haven't seen any (comments)on the group so I presume it must be plenty strong enough as is...Does the washer/nut not tend to eat away at the wood/fiberglass with use?

Thanks,
Alan.
