Subject: Re: Why not scale?

Sorry JG.

That's it. The design I am working on. Not building.
PARANIGMA is still on going and will be my tenth boat I have built. Most to my own designs.
I have had it in mind to build something a bit larger to take two for a while now, but like Nutty I have toyed with designs of up to 30 feet and more.
I have just had another go at exporting the new designs file on the old computer, this time to one of my camera memory cards, without success but I guess I will have to take it around to me mate(mate as in friend) to get it fixed.
My trouble is that I cannot find a driver for a card writer/reader or pen drive to suit Win98 that works on my machine.
On the new design I have taken the hull shape of PARADOX and made it double chined forward and aft while keeping the centre section single chine.
This gives it a nearly double ended water line, so in theory sculling and light wind performance should be a tad better.
With Matt's new idea for the shorter, wider chine runners this new hull shape should still allow them to work. 
Latest stat's,  Displacement 1832lbs, prismatic coefficient 0.548. Sail area about 150 sq ft.
I have been looking on this design as being slightly more offshore capable than PARADOX but only due to her extra size.
To get this length of boat, Paradox would need to be scaled by 1.2289156.
What would the new enlarged PARADOX weigh? Anyone.
Don't forget width and depth is enlarged as well.
