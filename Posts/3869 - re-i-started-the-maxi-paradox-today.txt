Subject: Re: I started the maxi paradox today

I just learned what it was called this morning (a tabernacle). My first choice would be to terminate the mast on deck to gain all the space below. If I feel like I can learn enough and get away with it (saiftly), I'll setup a tabernacle. It does seem that it will add to the complexity. Heck, I'm not even sure I'f I should be setting up a rigged mast, due to the increase in size. More to read.

I got back from the library today with 10 books on boat-building and sailing. It will be a late night again!
