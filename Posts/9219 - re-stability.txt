I love the idea of the floating rope,  trailed behind.

I assume this is for the MOB to grab as the boat sails away.

Let's suppose you recover from the cold water shock in about 10seconds.
At 4 knots (2.06m/second) the boat will have sailed 20.6 metres.
Let's say it takes another 10seconds to orientate yourself,  and swim toward the trailing rope.
The boat has now sailed 40metres,  so the rope needs to be,  say,  100m long (at least).

You now grab the passing rope with wet hands.
How much skin do you expect to have left on your palms?
(This is testable.   Get someone in a car to pull a trailing rope at 4knots (4.6mph) and grab it with your bare hands)

You now need to pull yourself (with your raw,  bleeding hands) along the rope against a 4knot wall of water,  in your face,  for between 40 and 100metres.
(This,  too,  is testable)

Invigorated by the cold and the adrenaline,  you now climb back into your boat.

I don't intend ever to test this,  but,  if someone does,  could you report back?   Please?

Best wishes,

John
