I suppose it depends on what your coastline is like. I use my Paradox for coastal cruising on the south coast of England and Fafnir just wouldn't do the job here. The 2ft 7in draft is just too great. It would have trouble getting over the bar into some of the smaller rivers, and getting ashore would be a pain. Does it dry out upright? Often, with the Paradox, I can run the bow ashore and step off dry shod.

Could be a challenge to get on and off the trailer too.

Nice boat if you want to stay at sea, though.
