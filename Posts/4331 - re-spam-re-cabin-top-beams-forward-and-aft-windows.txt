Hi Jeff,

As I just posted to Bill, there is no comparison between the two sails, 
I was very unhappy with the first one  due to problems mentioned. Zoe" 
would not point the same on different tacks, didnt want to power up in 
light airs etc. While sailing with Matt along side Paradox  I could not 
see much difference in performance off the wind but as soon as we turned 
into the wind he took off and left me like I was dragging an anchor. I 
was so disappointed I wanted to vomit. Had I known how to measure the 
yard back then I probably would have taken the sail back to the sail 
maker for adjustment instead of having a new one built. I do like the 
fact that the new one doesnt have as much boom overhang as Im building 
a wind vane for her and it makes it easier to get the vane closer to the 
transom. I would really love the chance to sail along side again for 
comparison now.

Hi Glen.
Thanks for the input. They seem to make a nice sail.
Have you found with your new sail that extra little bit of shape has made a
difference?
I had thought about buying from the States but I think I will stick with my
usual sail maker, CAWS SAILS in Cowes here on the island.
Graham, a one man show as well, has made me several sets of sails in the
past, sprit, lug and Bermudan, and he always comes up with the goods, and
they always set beautifully. He also will try the sails on the boat and 
make
alterations only if he is satisfied.
Ah well, back outside to do a spot more gluing. The temp is up to about 68
now.
