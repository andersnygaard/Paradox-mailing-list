Hi David,

If you are having Lee Helm (negative rudder) then your center of effort (CE) is to far forward of your center of lateral resistance (CLR) which causes the boat to fall away from the wind. There are a number of ways to adjust it, 1.) rake the mast aft if you can. 2.) tie the halyard to the forward most area of the yard that you can. 3.) move weight aft 4.) any combination of the above.
