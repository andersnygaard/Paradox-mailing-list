I like your comment of "wearing your boat."  I never really thought about Paradox that way; however, I used to think of my seakayak in that manner.  Nonetheless, it is a very good description of sailing in these little boats.  When we are in Little Cruiser, it is akin to being in a car so when conditions get rough you really don't get thrown about much like in a large boat.
