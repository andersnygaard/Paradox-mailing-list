Have you calculated the current total ballast weight base on the volume of water stored?


I'm seeking advice from you helpful folks here.

I sometimes live in  my Paradox for 20 days at a time without  replenishing  the food and drinking water during that period.

I don't put my  drinking  water in the ballast tanks because I'm afraid it would be tainted by the epoxy tank lining and also the ballast effect  would diminish as I consumed it. . So my 30 litres of drinking water is in 2  x  10 litre plastic containers - one  kept aft and one forward - plus some in one and half litre polycarbonate bottles,  stored inside the boat wherever  I can get them into odd corners..

So, I'm considering converting  the ballast tanks to additional storage space as  I need  more space low down in my Paradox to enable me to store heavy stuff  - food drinking water, anchors and chain, tools and whatever  -  and it seems to me that the 70 litres of space taken up by the ballast tanks could be used effectively for storage without reducing the ballast weight.

I would think that I could get most of  my bottles of drinking water in there and with space to spare for the extra anchors and chain and more. 

What are the downsides that I've missed and are there any tips from other users which might help?

Best
