Subject: Paradox stability

Last weekend I took my Paradox, Little Jim, to a lake to show her off to my brother. Some of the pictures we took show how sensitive (or not) Paradox is to weight distribution. Have a look at www.asjg.clara.co.uk/little_jim/little_jim.htm and click on 'stability & balance'

I was surprised to find that in light winds (<F2) I could keep up with a Minisail (2 up).

Next week, weather permitting, I am going to launch at Poole and sail to the other end of the Solent and back, something like 80 miles round trip.

Hoping for calm nights
