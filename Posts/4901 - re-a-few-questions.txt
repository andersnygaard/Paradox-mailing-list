Hi Pete.

In the past I have used a clear primer sealer for inside as well as outside coating.
After the first coat has gone touch dry and sunk into the wood I apply a second, rub down lightly when dry and then the usual undercoat and then top coat.
International do a clear primer sealer, the bigger tins work out a lot cheaper, but you might find the same type a lot cheaper in a paint shop or trade/DIY store.
I have even used floor paint for an interior finish.
Quite hardwearing.

Regards,
Jeff
