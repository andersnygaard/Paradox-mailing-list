Subject: Re: Scale mockup of wind genny and radar on Paradox


One interesting note I remember reading in the list archives (I went through and read all archive messages), was a note about someone considering adding extra weight to the mast to ease the roll motion of their Paradox. I'll have to try and find that message again.

Who is having roll problems with their Paradox, I've never experienced any.
