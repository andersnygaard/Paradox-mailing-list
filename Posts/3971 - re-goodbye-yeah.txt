Hello...

I do not know you or you me.

Thankfully - but I believe you are being a 'big dummie' - 

Is that good or bad and I resent all allusions to my waistline.

Burning bridges is for soldiers - adolescents - and mad men...

Well, I've been the first two and have thought that I was the third.

Besides - I personally would be more interested in having you about and seeing photos and notes of your next build and knowing how the fight with 'Gods given body' goes - life is full of challenges - taxes and death are the only things that are certain...

Ah, vicarious pleasure. mentioned more eloquently by Wencelaus.

I also believe that positive focus can cure all ills - don't stop what you are doing just because the Gods put a hurdle in front of you - they are just testing your courage and 'gumf'...

There is but one God and his name is Alan

So, by reading this I ain't actually gone!
