David,

Gollant Gaffer, a good choice. With a fine pedigree. She will last you a lifetime, provided you don't have a raft of friends wanting to go sailing, which would be a blessing. Good sea boat. In one of the UK boating mag there was a article on a home built Gollant sailing around Europe. I will look it up.
