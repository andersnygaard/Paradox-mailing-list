No, I haven't made the stem yet. I was going to start it this weekend, but find I haven't any boards wide enough.

As I said I wont be starting full assembly till the weather improves in the spring, the blanket sounds like a good idea though.

Thanks,

Al, have you make the stem? Make the tank top and floor food doors ( Doors as one big piece for now, cut later), and put them in position, this helps align the hull itself. The side panels will require some force the pull them to the stem, make a hot wet blanket and wrap them up for a while, it will make it easier to pull together. You may have to put it together two or three times to bevel things and get everything right (tack with no glue). While it temporarily together mark with a pencil all outlines around the bulkheads and everything, from these lines cut out all the insulation pieces, this assures a good fit. Don
