Subject: Building Paradox manual by Don Elliott - how to order - my experience


Because other members of the group have had difficulty ordering this manual in the past (and to be frank, so did I in November 2009), I thought I would provide a brief update for the record.

The manual is available on a CD, or as PDFs by email.

I emailed an initial enquiry to Don Elliott's widow Wanda at donelliott at localnet.com, and received a very helpful and friendly reply two days later, part of which said:


"The Building Paradox series of articles is ready for immediate shipping. There are some eighty pages and 16 Chapters, and it is available as a CD or as PDF files e-mailed directly to you. Please specify which you prefer. Using PayPal is the fastest way to receive the booklet. (PayPal payments are made to the email address above).

The Building Paradox Booklet includes a detailed description of Paradox, with analysis of the design, along with detailed building instructions. Included is a new and enlarged section on making and installing Paradox's ballast weights. The Paradox series booklet is fully illustrated (over 100); this greatly accelerates the Paradox building process.

The price is USD14.00 (plus CD postage if required of USD2.00 local surface mail, USD4.00 local airmail or USD8.00 overseas airmail)."


My initial email enquiry: 	08 November
Wanda's email reply:		10 November
My payment to Paypal:		10 November
Paypal advice to Wanda:		10 November
PDF files emailed to me:	13 November

The four PDF files are sent as attachments to two emails.

1 Paradox...pdf (59.0 KB)
2 Paradox...pdf (3.0 MB)
3 Paradox...pdf (138.8 KB) 
4 Paradox...pdf (866.2 KB)

If anyone has difficulties in the future obtaining these files, the original manual (in 16 parts), can be copied from the magazine "Messing about in Boats":

There are two additional Paradox articles (published between 1983-2000) that may be of interest. There does not appear to be an index of articles 2000-.
