Hi all,

I have wondered if, due to the ability to balance the boat so well on 
the main rudder, if a wind vane steering system could operate on a 
small, entirely independent, rudder. This would just have to apply 
the correcting adjustments as the main rudder would be holding the 
general course.

Then I wondered if this could be fitted on the bow, with the wind 
vane on the fore deck where there is oodles of space with no chance 
of interference from the sails.

Just some thoughts, though I don't think I shall be fitting one on 
Little Jim.

Hoping for calm nights
