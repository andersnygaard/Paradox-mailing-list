Hi Jack, 

I have been following this post with some interest as I am sure others have. It's a large group and I have only seen a few negative comments from those who feel strongly about leaving the design alone. Please don't feel you are being attacked, I don't think that was anyone's intent but rather to preserve the design. If it can be built in steel, aluminum, foam sandwich or any other material I for one want to keep up with the progress of the builder. Stay with us and keep us informed of your progress.

Tailwinds,

Glen

I feel this topic in this forum will not go on in a positive direction publicly, therefore I am taking it private. Thanks to all who participated
