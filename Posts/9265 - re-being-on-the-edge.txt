Thank you, Paradoxians for sharing and educating.... Chinese Gybe. 

I suppose it was that sort of gybe, and I never had experienced this gybe prior. There is a difference sailing a paradox than the traditional triangle sail... someone mentioned that the paradox sail does need to be in so tight when close hauled, I learned that practice to be true from my two times sailing "The Edge."

I sometimes think that it may be more advantageous for one to learn to sail a paradox without prior experience of a Bermudian rig. At times, I discovered that my practice of sail trim based on the Bermudian rig was sort of a hinderance, and that I was better server by allowing myself to be more perceptive about how the lug rig boat sailed. There is something elegant about a sail cloth untethered to the mast by where it is more free and adventurous leading our Paradox boats to destinations of planned and unplanned surprises.

Yes, my gybe or sailkite flying trimming technique learned me much. It wont be the last lesson "The Edge" will give me, and I am hunger for more.

Fair winds,
