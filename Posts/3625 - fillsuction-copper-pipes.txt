Drawing 5 shows the diameter of the fill/suction copper pipe as 12 mm. How does this work in practice? Does it take a long time to fill or suck out the water from the ballast tanks?

I believe Al uses a 12 volt bilge pump to remove the water, presumably with a pipe that just fits the internal diameter of the fill/suction pipe? Is this how it is done? What is the best method of filling the tanks? Does one use a funnel, or is the bilge pump in reverse mode used to fill the tanks, especially if filling with sea or lake water?

I suppose one could use a garden hose system for filling the tanks where there is a fresh water tap near the launching slipway.

Does anyone fill up at home before setting off on the road to the location where the boat is to be sailed?

It seems to me that with 180 kilos of lead ballast permanently fitted to the boat, 70 litres (70 kilos) of water will not change the situation drastically for when the boat is on the road. She probably sails well without water ballast, or at least without the full 70 kilos, as Matt intended it as fresh water for drinking, providing, of course, precautions and preparations are made - apparently, System Three epoxy is suitable. I'd be interested to have comments from those who have tried the boat with and without water ballast and if you use the tanks for drinking water, what epoxy you used.

What's the best way of closing off the fill/suction pipes at deck level so that the tanks can be replenished with rain water collected on the decks? I note from my photos of Al's `Little Jim' that he has installed what looks like stainless steel screw in caps.
