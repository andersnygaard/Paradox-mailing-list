Alf,

Kokanee Gold Amber Lager it was. 

In the longneck bottle of course:-)

What part of AB have you emigrated to? I just got back from there 
before the flooding. I went out through Crowsnest Pass and up 22. 
Spent the night at Longview and bought some stuff at Ian Tyson's 
Navaho Mug. Then on to Calgary and up to Banff. 

Two days in Drumheller phootgraphing the badlands on the way home.

Saw lots of horses, antelope, bison, mule deer, elk, one bear and 
even some moutain goats.

Did not see one sailboat that I recall:-(

Cheers, Nels
