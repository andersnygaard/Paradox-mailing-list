Jack,

Skip those instructions. Use this:
http://modtang.sitesled.com/bitcomet/index.html

Within BitComet click on create add the name of the file and a tracker.
This tracker works:
http://tracker.desitorrents.com:6969/announce 

Then just upload the torrent file to the file section here.

I think thats it. I tried a test file, but I have a hardware firewall,
and because it masks my true ip address, it seems to mess up initially
seeding a file.
