I agree with you Al. I come to sailboats from a sailplane point of view, I'm a pilot.

Sharp corners will introduce turbulence and the remedy is to add a small fillet at the intersection of two components like these.

However it doesn't need to be a big fillet. Something as small as a half inch fillet can be very effective in reducing turbulence and therefore drag at an intersection like we are discussing here.

You could probably use a mixture of epoxy, flox and microsheres covered with a three inch glass tape to fillet the area and obtain all of the improvement that's possible in an intersection like this.
