Thanks for the Jimmy Lu link... I had found all the rest. I like his mold for the lamination to the beams.. it looks simple. Still need to figure out sizes....must be the air... will take a break and come back .. see if anyone can help then try again... heh... I'm having fun.

Rodney,

As others have said, good luck with your build. Your schedule will be demanding, but if you can work almost full time on the boat i'd say achievable (but there's more to this boat than meets the eye).
Jimmy Lu built his "Auspice" 
http://tw.myblog.yahoo.com/fi156-storch/
in a very short time earlier this year, I think less than 8 months, and I have no doubt it could be done quicker.

I myself have been at mine for 16 months and still have a lot more to do. I can go for weeks doing nothing as the demands of my wife and kids come first! I could build faster, but I always envisaged this to be my retirement boat, and that won't be for at least 10 years yet. I hope it's finished by then!

I understand why you just want to get on and build. This is my first build also and I had no desire to build something first as an apprenticeship. I just learn as I go and so far have had nothing that has stumped me completely. I windsurf when there's enough wind, and I can sail with others when I have the time, so I have no desire for anything other than my Paradox at the moment.

One of the most useful things I've found is the photo's posted by other builders. Obviously I'm sure you've checked out the photos on this group and at http://groups.yahoo.com/group/paradoxbuilders2 but also extremely useful are the following:
Al's Little Jim

Bill's Faith http://www.paradox-uk.co.uk/
Jimmy's Auspice http://tw.myblog.yahoo.com/fi156-storch/
Alberto's Cachivache http://www.derawson.com.ar/fotos.htm

Anyway good luck and keep us appraised of your progress and keep asking questions.
I'm off now to get ready to hopefully fit my foredeck tomorrow.

Cheers
Pete
