Subject: Re: Adding 3-4" to cabin top?

If the port edge of the cabin is raised then it will foul the boom 
when you try to fold it onto the side deck.

Hello All, I am looking at the Paradox as a future project. I am a little concerned  about the head room of the cabin. I need 37" to sit up with "proper" posture. As the design work on this little ship seems very "tight" I am wondering  what factors I would run into if I add to the over all height of the cabin top. Has anyone successfully added a dome or pram hood to the  cabin slide? I understand that the design is scale-able, but I am inclined to build as close to design as possible. Thanks, Woody
