Many years ago:
Steel (Cor-ten)   $0.35/lb
90/10 Cu/Ni       $12.50/lb

90/10 Cu/Ni yield strength is not high, 16 ksi annealed, but mild 
steel is only 25 ksi.


To sheath ply, I would use 5200 only.  Most would say 5200 plus 
fasteners.  If the entire bottom panel was metal, I would use
5200 plus fasteners. (same with steel)


I would use 5200 only.  Most would say 5200 plus galvenized steel 
fasteners with exposed fastener bedded in epoxy.
