Ya.... been working on get the beam jigs rigged all day.... just looking at the plans.. I swear my head has been spinning for hours.=A0 Luckly I purchased Don's build manual.. but still I am confused... His manual says make deck and cabin beams all one length and cut to size later... ok.. um... I know this is cheating but if anyone could e-mail me the suggested size for all deck and then all cabin beams ..adding the 3" extra to each end as per manual I would be extremly grateful as I must be trying too hard and am not getting it.=A0 Some days are like this... its funny I thought the angles and curve would stump me... no I get that. heh.
