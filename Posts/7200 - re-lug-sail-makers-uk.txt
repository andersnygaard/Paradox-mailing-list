You've done well to get four cruises in this year, what with the rotten weather, but the advantage of Paradox is that you seldom get wet sailing her. I can't pull the hatch over and sail my WWP because if she needs attention at the helm I have to be there holding the tiller, but I must say she went very well on Saturday when it was blowing a Force 4/5 - but nowhere near as convenient for reefing as a Paradox.

Cheers,
Bill.
