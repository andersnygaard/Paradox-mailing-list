I was out last weekend in an estuary (Salcombe) having a great time when suddenly as I tried to tack we got stuck in irons, head to wind. Nothing I could do did any good and we just sat there until I got the yuloh out and drove us round with that. It occurred to me then that a small jib would be useful to push us round.

I have had this symptom recur a number of times, usually out of the blue. In the whole weekend I only had trouble tacking twice and the other time it fell back onto the original tack and I gibed round. I know I can cure it by moving the cg aft, but we are already down by the stern relative to the drawn water-line.

Still, I had a great relaxing weekend though, despite that, and the running aground on the rocks, and ..........

Hoping for calm nights
