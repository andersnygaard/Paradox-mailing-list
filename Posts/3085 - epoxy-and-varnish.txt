Subject: Epoxy and Varnish

Hi,

Just made the boom while I waited for the current bit of the mast to set and I'm just about to 
put on the reefing spool(?).

I'm starting to think about the finish for the mast, boom and yard.

I like to see a wooden mast with a painted end. Should I epoxy the whole spar or varnish or 
epoxy then varnish? Or, is there another way to tackle this that I ought to know about? Do I 
treat the boom and yard differently to the mast. I remember that Jack's hits the sea 
sometimes. I could fit a wader, or a rubber glove on the end :0)

I just spent a happy half hour using a cabinet scraper around the knots in the boom and then 
realised that it will be hidden in a sleeve of the sail!

Thanks all.... 
Derek
