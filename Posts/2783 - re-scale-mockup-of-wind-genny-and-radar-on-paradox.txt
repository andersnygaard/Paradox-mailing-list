Hi Glen,

OK, finally found the message I was thinking-- from Jan 2004 in a thread regarding mast construction.  DC's message #1727 and your reply #1731.

DC made a comment that a heaver [carbon fiber/wood composite] mast "would provide a more comfortable motion."  You then replied that the composite mast would "about half the weight and triple the strength".

So, not roll problems exactly, but a comment that some extra weight aloft might not necessarily a bad thing.
