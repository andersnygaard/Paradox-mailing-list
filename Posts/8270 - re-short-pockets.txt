I think the gold plated version would have all Marine Plywood, multiple batteries, solar panels, new Honda outboard, two part epoxy marine paint, all the electronic toys and a new trailer. 12k is an outside number...

I think mine is going to be closer to 2k....

So what did you spend total, if you dare total it all up?
