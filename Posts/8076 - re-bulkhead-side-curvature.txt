Subject: Re: Bulkhead side curvature

It's related to the curvature of the sides along the boat.
Plywood that thick can be bent only into conical or cylindrical sections:  the curve and the twist of the sides forces a conic section.
If you leave the sides of the bulkheads straight the side panels may not touch at all points.
If you hammer the nails in properly,  and fill the (tiny) gaps with thickened epoxy,  it might not matter.   Or you could shim the sides of the bulkheads.

I notice that Al (it was you,  Al?) curved the sides of the transom even though it's not on the plans;  didn't seem to matter?

Hello,

I've cut out bulkhead 3 (no others yet) and just noticed that it is supposed to have 5mm convex curvature on the sides.  I see that bulkheads 1, 2, possibly the transom, but not 4, also have varying degrees of curvature.

Why do you think Matt specified that?

Looks, a little more space in the side lockers, more efficient form through the water when healed, strength and rigidity through creating a slight compound curve or what?

In other words how important do you think these convex bulkhead curves are?  Would the boat look a lot more boxy without them?  I suspect so, so I'm thinking it's mainly a looks thing, but I don't really know.

To solve my problem I have three options:

1.  Cut all the bulkheads with straight sides and forget about convexity.
2.  Buy a new piece of plywood and start again (I should be able to use the remainder to cut out a full size bulkhead 2 although it will be 18mm instead of 12mm and use the rest as cleats)?
3.  Glue overlapping cleats on bulkhead 3 to gain the 5mm convex curvature (but, it seems that bulkhead 3 doesn't have side cleats).

What do you think?

Cheers,

Rob.
