The stays or shrouds does not show in the drawings because I believe that in this design they are not needed. First everyone who has used this boat have not broken their mast. Second the boat is a bit narrow. This means to my mind that the energy in the wind will roll the hull over before the mast takes too much force. The mast is protected by the narrow hull. I have sudden gusts of wind here too. I'm not worried at all. Good Luck, Steve Yahn
