see.... I need to wait until I build my boat or at least get the plans before I get concerned. Heh, heh,.... I thought it would be a real pain to skull. This is great info...Thanx!! Wooo Hooo Can't wait to hit the water.

Hi,
If you grab almost any can of food, say baked-beans, you will read
that there are let's say 2000kj of energy in there, or about 500 food 
calories. If you then do a conversion or two, you can workout that's 
about the same as 500watt-hours. 
If Al's outboard uses 15amps @ 12volts =180watts, it will go about 2.7 
hours on the amount of energy in the baked-bean can, and doing 2knots.
The average human can probably do about the same speed in a boat this
size, by rowing, sculling, or using a yuloh.
Since it is known that Mr Average can comfortably produce 100watts 
output power, he should be able to keep going for at least the same 
time on the same can of food, and in theory about 5 hours!
'Food for thought' eh?
The human body is actually quite efficient, and you have to have it 
with you anyway...

I can confirm that rowing (sculling) the Paradox can be quite a low 
energy exercise. I am by no measure an athlete (or even very fit) but 
I once rowed Little Jim for 3 miles and found I had averaged just 
under 2 knots. The longest continuous rowing I have done is for 4 
hours and, while glad to stop, I could have continued for some time 
longer.

However if you try to go fast you will be knackered in no time.

Hoping for calm nights
