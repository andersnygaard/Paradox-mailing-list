no need to quench it, air cool is good enuf, place a length of pipe over it where you want the bend and use the pipe for leverage, you may have to move the pipe and bend a lil repeat as needed, even finding a tree with a V in it to hold it could be used, I didnt need to anneal mine. Just use some force :) you might want to drill a hole in a stump or a log to hold it.
