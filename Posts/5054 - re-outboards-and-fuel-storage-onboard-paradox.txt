Subject: Re: Outboards and fuel storage onboard Paradox

I have 25 pounds of battery and a trolling motor which will give me 4 
hours at 2 knots (or 2 hours at 3 knots). Ok for emergency use, but 
no good for what Bill is doing.

I have no on-board charging, but I do carry a mains charger so I 
could fill up at a marina. So far the need hasn't arisen.

Hoping for calm nights
