Subject: Re: Yard Part Build for Paradox

Interesting modification. Thank you for sharing. I'll have to learn about the new vs old sail design.

I thought I needed a bigger dimension for the yard, but discovered that the mill to inch conversation for the yard is approximately 1.5 inches and 2 inches.

Seeing a number in millimeters is just a number. I see things in inches and feet. The build will help me to learn and see --- in my mind -- millimeters as I get used to the conversion.

Hello Sailors,

I was wondering about the different types of material you may have used to build the yard. The wood of choice is DF correct? I thought others decided on a denser wood and commented that the denser wood made the yard heavy; others have used aluminum? -- or at least experimented with aluminum.

Have most builders used DF for the yard? I am now shopping for a good lumber place for wood materials on in the NE area of U.S.

Fair winds,
Deric
