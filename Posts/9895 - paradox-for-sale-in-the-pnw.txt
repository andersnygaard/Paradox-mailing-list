Hello all,

I've got my Paradox (and my Enigma 460) for sale in north Idaho. I'm now living on my boat in Seattle so I can trail to western WA if needed. Search "scout paradox sailboat" on YouTube to see. Email me for more info if interested. I had it listed on FB but forgot to here. I need to sell them or wrap and store, I'll be off to Mexico in early September. I'm a motivated seller.
