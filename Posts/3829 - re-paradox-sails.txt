Hi Twitch_816,

Matt chose sleeves for simplicity. He doesn't like things to be overcomplicated, and I agree with him on that. When I constructed the Paradox, I used a single layer of 12 oz biax on the bottom and it took about a gallon of epoxy. Of course, at that time, it was harder to get a cut piece of the material. I had to purchase a full roll of 150 yards.

I finally got to sail her yesterday for the first time this year.  We had 6-10 knot winds and I sailed for about 4 hours without touching the tiller. I had to motor back as the wind died at dusk, but I can't wait to get back out.

Regards,
Jack
