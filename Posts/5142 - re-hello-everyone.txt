Phil, a big welcome aboard! Your in good hands living so close the the experts of Paradox. While you mention you are building with your son, reminds me of boatbuilding with my own young son. He told me that if a sawhorse is used during boatbuilding it sould not be called a sawhorse but instead a Seahorse! Have fun. Steve Yahn, on Puget Sound, near Seattle.
