For the lower gugeon at least, i would not trust anything but BOLTS !

( think about it - with the helm hard over and striking the bottom there is enough force to break your Tiller. ( and/or the Rudder blade.....)
 I would rather the tiller broke before the lower Gudgeon went cause it's easier to improvise a Tiller ......)
Cheers Frank

I epoxied my gudgeon in place on mine. I don’t see any problem with that.

Hello Sybe34,

Using epoxy to fasten a gudgeon is typically not a preferred method because it makes it difficult to remove the parts apart. A product that is a sealant with adhesive qualities in combination with bolts is considered sufficient for fixing the gudgeon to the boat.

I am the owner of Don Elliott's boat build, and I see he did not use epoxy to fasten the gudgeon to the boat.

Let us know if you decide differently.
