Hi Greg.

NOLI is the same size as PARADOX but of a different design and lighter.
She is constructed stitch and glue from 6mm marine ply for the topsides and 9mm for the bottom.
I personally believe PARADOX could be built lighter from marine ply, as it is stronger than exterior ply.
9mm for the topsies and two layers of 9mm for the bottom will be fine and just as strong as building from 12mm and 25mm exterior as called up on Matt's drawings.
It will be easier to bend round the bottom as well.
If you can buy the Marine ply from you mate at the same price as exterior or cheaper, I would go for it.
