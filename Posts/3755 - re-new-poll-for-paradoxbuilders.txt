Good Question. I'll probably have the same situation and the same question for myself too. I suppose what I was wondering about was a situation like this. A "Has everyone who has ever built and sailed a Paradox found that 99% of the time 400 LBS was the least you would ever want."  Or B "That 150 lbs was all that was needed and the boat was too much of a slow dog with more than that."  Something along those lines. It is sort of like asking How hard will the wind blow? Is it not? The tire store source for lead is an outstanding idea. Thanks Al.
