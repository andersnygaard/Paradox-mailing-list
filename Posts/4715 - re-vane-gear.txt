Subject: Re: Vane gear

Hey Bill,

I'm afraid I'll be around for a while, the wife's illness steadily worsens and she now needs full time care which of course impacts building, sailing etc. The last time I got a chance to go out and test the vane the winds were light and the gear performed poorly if at all. I attribute this to the vane blade being too small so will enlarge it and give it another try. I have also had some minor trouble with assembly and am correcting them as they appear. I won’t be doing any drawings until I get everything working correctly and dependably. As has been mentioned the Paradox design is well balanced and will sail herself for long periods of time. However if you find yourself crawling around trying to find something she will be all over the place, thus the need for some sort of autopilot. I use an Autohelm 800 connected to the tiller lines and it works great but of course uses more power then I like. It is great for short trips but not for more then about three days. I made an adapter to connect to the tiller lines by drilling a hole in a large washer that would fit under the rod end fitting on the pilot. To the hole I attached a piece of line that I could tie to the tiller line with a rolling hitch. Of course you will need a line going fore and aft because you can’t push a rope. The pilot is mounted on the edge of the starboard aft locker using a cradle to support the outboard or rod end. The lines need to be long enough that you can slide the rolling hitches together to un-couple the pilot and then pull them away from each other and take out the slack in the tiller lines to couple. Sounds complex but is actually very simple. I’ll see if I can get a few pictures of the set up put together.
