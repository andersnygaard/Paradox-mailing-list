Hello Al

Yes, that was me in my Hurley 22 'Gypsy' with Mary, my crew. We're 
hoping to go over to Scilly next Monday for the week, weather permitting.

I live near Camborne, West Cornwall, and keep Gypsy at St Just in 
Roseland.  However, I have a friend that I occasionally go to visit 
who lives in Shepton Mallet, so I may make use of the next time I'm 
up that way to take you up on your offer.

I'm sure there will be plenty of unclear stuff, but in conjunction 
with the plans, I do find the photo's in Bill's website most instructional.  No doubt there are other sites that show the same 
sort of construction pictures and I dare say I'll be looking around 
them soon enough!

Regards

Phil
