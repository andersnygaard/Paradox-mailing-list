Subject: Re: [paradoxsailboat] What would you change on 2nd build?

I made the runners on the side of the sliding hatch from commercially made dressed all round oak, it was a good price and made the runners exactly parallel, exactly. The curve of the various beams was sanded as close to exact as I could. It runs easily and is water tight in rain. The rear of the hatch, where it rests closed was made slightly too tight then sanded just enough to allow it to close when varnished. It shuts tight and again is water tight. To get out in the morning I push up on the rear of the hatch to get it to move up and off the cabin rear, (above the rear window). The side runners are bolted on to the roof, so they could be repaired and replaced and that has not been needed after three years of intermittent use.
