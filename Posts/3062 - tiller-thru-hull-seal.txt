Subject: Tiller thru hull seal

Hi All,

I just got thru sealing the tiller thru hull. I used a leg from an old 
12 mm wet suit. I cut it to size bolted it to the transom and lashed it 
to the tiller, I tested it with a water hose, it works great.

I have never had any trouble with water comming in, I read somewhere 
where Matt did. My problem is with Bugs (Whasps) getting in while she 
is on the trailer. Theres nothing like crawling up into the bow and 
finding a Whasp nest, you just cant move quick enough up there!!
