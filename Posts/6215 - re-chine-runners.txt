The chinerunner article is in the May 2009 archive on Svens site.
The builders of the triloboat 16 tried chinerunners and found them to be ineffective.Some kind of intuition suggests that having the bow immersed is important for the boat to grip,which is of course impossible with a boxboat.
I designed a chinerunner boat which was a scaled down Paradox/Enigma and would reach a similar depth of immersion with only my own 250kg weight.From memory it was 7ft 10ins long and 33 ins wide.I made a full size cardboard model and it fitted me OK but it looked very strange and highsided.I had a feeling it would be unstable because it would be impossible too get my weight low enough.Its a concept I still can't let go of though.
