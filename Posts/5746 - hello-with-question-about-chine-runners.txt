Subject: Hello .. with question about chine runners

Hello Group!

I just joined after finding the group on the htt9://www.microcruising.com website and Learning about Littl Cruiser.

I am owner of another small sharpie design and am looking into adding chine runners or some other keel to it to make it more seaworthy for cruising.

I am now a bit confused about chine runners. At first I thought they were cast rails of lead or something which followed the bottom and acted as a ballest keel as well as providing lateral resistance. Now I have seen some pictures that show non-weighted wooden finds whick project horizontally from the sides.

Are both of these ideas "chine runners" or does the chine runner contain no ballast? I would sure appreciate more explaination about "chine runners" for this nubie here LOL

I am happy to find this group!

Regards,

Andrew
