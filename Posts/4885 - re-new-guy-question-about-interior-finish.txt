Subject: Re: New guy question about interior finish

Two other options you might consider to protect against UV degradation
are spar varnish or cetol. The first gives a clear finish but contains
uv inhibitors and the second is less transparent but gives a nice
"woodsy" look and is actually more durable than varnish.

There are other similar choices as well.
