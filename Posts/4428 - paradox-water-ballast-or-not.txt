Hi all,

I had Little Jim out last weekend (F5-6, quite exciting) and noticed that the bottom of the main locker got a bit damp. I have traced this to a failure of the screw-in inspection cover of one of the ballast tanks. I have continually had trouble with these leaking, and had tried replacing the other one only a month ago with limited success. So I have decided to abandon the water ballast and fit permanent lead ballast instead. I will leave 10kg as water ballast, in 2 litre bottles, so that I can fine tune the trim.

Hoping for calm nights
