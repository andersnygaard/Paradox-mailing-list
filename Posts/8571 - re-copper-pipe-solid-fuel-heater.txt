Subject: Re: Copper Pipe Solid Fuel Heater

Hi Brian,

That heater looks good and your construction method is nice. The copper heater does get very hot and I have mine fixed in an aluminium army mess tin and that is standing on a piece of scrap 3/4 inch plywood to protect the cabin sole.

The aluminium mess tin's handle is clipped to the cabin side with a quick release cleat so that it can't fall over when an unsociable speed boat goes roaring past. and there is a bit of silicone rubber sheet clipped to the cabin side to give protection from scorching..

None of it is fixed permanently, all can be removed in seconds to be stored away.

Tiny wood scraps burn quickly, give a lot of fast heat. Good for a quick warm up. Barbecue charcoal burns slower with a more gentle heat.

Keep warm.

Best,
Jim
