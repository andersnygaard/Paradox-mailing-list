Subject: Re: Silicone removal

Hey Chris. I'm kind of having trouble visualizing what you are talking about here with the excess silicone. Maybe you can post a picture of the problem. Incidentally, I've removed all the windows on Little Cruiser in the past, and I found that a sharp chisel worked fine for scraping off the silicone so that a new batch could be put on. Anyway, best of luck with the refit.  Dave
