The SUV of Paradoxes - bring your friends, this baby seats 8!!
It'd get pretty hot and stuffy in there though.
You could probably put a seat/hatch in one of the front compartments
too (but that's just crazy-talk.)

I'm still learning my 3d program (blender), so go easy on me. ;)

Anyone else use blender?  It's tough to learn, but it's a nicely
featured program (and open source!)

Any idea how many sheets of plywood this beast would chew up?  I'm
terrified just thinking about it.
