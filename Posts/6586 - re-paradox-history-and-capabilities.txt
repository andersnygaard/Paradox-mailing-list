If you look at my web site (see my sig) you will see the build took me about 18 months of evenings and weekends. This seems to be about 
the norm for those that didn't take a sabbatical half way through.

Coasting is much more interesting. Once you are out of sight of land it is just boring (unless it gets 'interesting' when you probably wish it was boring). Watching the scenery go past is much better and you can see you are getting somewhere.
