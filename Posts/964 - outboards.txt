Hi All,

I just got back from an overnighter on Whisper. I left the outboard home this time. I rigged a makeshift Yuloh using a Kayak paddle, It worked ok. A proper Yuloh will be my next project.

I was lisening to Matt's opinion on motor's is the reason I left the outboard at home this time. It hit home with me. He said motors are fine as long as you understand they are a luxury and you don't depend on them to get you out of trouble. This is exactly what I was doing. I was using the outboard to make up for my lack of sailing experience. Experienced sailors know this, for me it was a valuable lesson. Thanks Matt !! I was suprised as to what I could do when I had too. Mabe someone else can learn from this also.
