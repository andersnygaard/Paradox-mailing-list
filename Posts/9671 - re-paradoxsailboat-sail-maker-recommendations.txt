Hello all,

I am at the stage in my build of wanting to have a sail made. I am
looking for any recommendations for sail makers that have made a good
and proper sail for the paradox.

It rather depends on where in the world you are if my recommendations 
would be any use.

However, make sure your sail-maker understands lug rigs. He should 
take into account the flexing of the yard when under load. The guy 
who made my current sail insisted on having the yard so he could 
measure its flexibility. My original sail-maker was no doubt 
excellent at making racing sails for bermudan rigs, but he was 
useless at making lug sails.
