Heheheheh, that's the paint that the West Advisor suggested and that I described as a copolymer ablative paint :-) I suspect this is West's house brand for Interlux Micron CSC or Petit ACP-50 (my best guess is the latter for no really good reason except price similarity and formulation).

Although it's quite a bit more expensive, I think I'd look into Interlux Micron CSC Plus with the added anti-slime biocide. For a Paradox, it's only $20/Qt. more, and i'm risk adverse, not to mention lazy ;-)

Glen, you sail on Florida's west coast don't you? That's where I had my unfotunate experience with an unprotected boat bottom. That Gulf water sure does get waaarm and soupy, especially compared to Florida's east (Atlantic) coast!
