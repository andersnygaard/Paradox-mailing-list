Sorry, can't help with the Rhino, but I have just this week put some non-skid on my decks. I got it from a local furniture superstore (Ikea). It was in the childcare section and is intended for stairways. It came on a roll 25mm wide by 5m long for 1.5 ukp! Such a bargain I bought 2.

Hoping for calm nights
