Lezlie,

That is just more incentive for me to make the drive. Beyond my inept boatbuilding skills, I'm running out of excuses not to be there.

If I make it to Seadrift this year, I'll be sure to look for you & TARDIS.

And again, thanks for sharing your building blog! It is helpful, inspiring, and entertaining.

Bobby
