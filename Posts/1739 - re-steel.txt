Subject: Re: Steel?

No problem at all,

Ive given it alot of thought, and Ive decided to build a stock from the plans paradox. I will take it out and sail it. If I really like the boat I will continue on to steel. As that project is progressing I will continue to research building in steel. So far Ive decided that the stock size does not lend itself to steel as well as if its stretched, I get more of a buffer zone. Construction is not a problem at all as I have 2 buddys that are professional welders. The weather prohibits me from building in steel at this time as my barn is wooden. also logistics rise, material, trailer requirements. also as Bill L. has pointed out to me the rigging also must be beefed up a bit. as we all know, there is no free lunch. So either way im building a paradox :) I am a skilled craftsman, il do my best not to bastardize the designers example of a paradox.
