Actually, I do sail with others on occasion and for that I have a 14ft Peep Hen for quick getaway and delightful sailing. If you haven't noticed this design by Rubin Train, you owe it to yourself to check it out. We now have 4 of them in our family. When I first sailed my brother Greg's I couldn't believe how such a broad beamed short boat could sail so well. As for room, compared to a paradox, it is a palace.

Glen is 5'9" and 185 lb. (He only sails solo as far as I am aware.)

I am about the same size as Glen but have decided Paradox is too small as I sail with a crew at times. So I chose a Bolger Micro instead. It has two 7' berths.
