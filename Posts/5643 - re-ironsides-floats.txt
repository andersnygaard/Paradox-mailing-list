Beautiful work Steve! You must be very proud. I'm in Portland, OR, not too far from you so perhaps one of these days we can sail our Paradoxes together like Faith and Little Jim. I haven't had her out on the Columbia yet since moving here but would like to explore the Puget Sound a little. For now I'm just finishing off a self steering windvane. I'll share with the group when completed.
