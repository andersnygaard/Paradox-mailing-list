I didn't do a check when back on the mooring, but I ran the engine in total for about an hour - say a consumption of no more than half a litre.

5 litres will take 'Faith' 30 nautical miles; 1 litre will do 6 miles and 1/2 litre will do 3 miles.

2 cans of 5 litres is what I normally carry and that will take my Paradox 6o nautical miles when the conditions are calm.

Give me a petroleum engine in preference to an electric one every time; power, speed and duration win hands down.

A petrol outboard transforms Paradox into a very able motor/sailer that can instantly be converted, dare I say it, into a motorboat!  She could easily explore the canals of Europe where petrol is readily available.

I wouldn't fancy using a yuloh to do the same.  A yuloh on a Paradox is only of use when there is hardly any wind.  Try using it in a force 2 or more, and considerable effort is required, just to keep the boat moving on course.  Al's tip of having the rudder raised does help, but when it's windy there's always a fight to prevent the bow from being blown to one side or the other.  I believe Sven's boats score better when being powered by yulohs, because they have a forward drop board that provide grip.
