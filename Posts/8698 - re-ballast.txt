I had a similar issue
The sail I bought was cot to fit a non tapered boom and yard
I replaced my beautiful wooden yard with an ugly flat aluminium non tapered affair
The creases all but disappeared , soon as I can afford it I'll do the same with the boom
It won't help it furling unevenly but it will fly smoother
Take the sail down from the spars
(Get three friends) pull gently until there's even pressure on each corner
Hold the sail at each corner and see if it's crease free
It should be
That's the process I followed with the local sailmaker
It helped me
