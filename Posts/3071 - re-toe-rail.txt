Sounds like a definite need to me then :0)

Can anybody help with a UK supplier of thse metal ones with the slots in? I've tried 
Googling but can't get it specific enough. They seem to come attached to yachts - 
expensive ones!

It is 0300 here and I've just planed my mast blanks and done a dry assembly. I've felt 
unwell and slept since early Saturday evening until a couple of hours ago. Now I'm wide 
awake of course. It is 16 degrees in the workshop so I think that I may as well epoxy the 
one side to the back.

cheers   .....  Derek
