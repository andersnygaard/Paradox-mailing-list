I premanufactured them, as I recall they were about 10" long so easy to get out on a band saw. If I was only allowed one mounted power tool to build a boat it would be a band saw. If allowed two then a table saw would be next. Watch for old tools to come available in the classifieds, they are far superior to the new tinny stuff. I bought all my shop tools from people who upgraded to the new fancy tools. My table saw is about 50 years old, a Sears model, all cast iron. I paid $50 for it some twenty odd years ago.
