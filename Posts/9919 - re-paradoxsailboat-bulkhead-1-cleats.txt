Ben, 

I have watched your build videos on YT. In Elliott's book he says a table saw is a necessity, but it looks like you cut bulkheads and sides with a circular saw. Is that correct? Do I need a table saw? 

You also mentioned that you might not have used 18mm for the bottom. What would you have done differently? Any additional tips are welcome. 

Thanks,
