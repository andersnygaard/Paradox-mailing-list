Hi Al.

This new oar/yuloh does not stall the leading edge when on the return
stroke, if I read it right.
Apparently, they taught a monkey to use it. So I might be able to use it
as well.
My idea is to fit a fence to the bottom of the blade, parallel with the
water line. This should stop the water breaking away and causing tip
vortex.
I forgot to say that for extra storage on NOLI I will be fitting 2 or 3
hooks under the shelves between bulkheads 2 and 3. From these I will
be able to hang a dry bag. There will also be some eye hooks fitted to
the sole so I can lace the bags against the hull sides.
I think leaving out the bins on PARADOX would be a good mod for the
larger sailors along with the others I mentioned..
I have yet to try and fit my Brompton in the forward compartment. I think
there might be a problem as it is fitted with a seat extension.
