hi Jack

I've checked out local galvanisers and there is a minimum charge of =A370. I think they just don't want the aggravation of individual pieces.
I can always replace the piece as it rusts.  Galvanised pipe is very cheap, and often free, at the local scrap yards.
Will you be able to send me a picture of your set up? I'd rather copy something that works.

Cheers  ....  Derek
