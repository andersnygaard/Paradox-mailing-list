Hi Jack.

No offense taken. Actually, I think that I may owe you an apology. I thought that you were referring to a post I made yesterday on microcruising. My assumption, my error.

For those interested in an aircraft canopy, it's not new by any means. The F-16 canopy has been utilized by unlimited hydros for almost twenty years. Of course, the unlimited hydros and Paradox are close cousins.

Have fun.
