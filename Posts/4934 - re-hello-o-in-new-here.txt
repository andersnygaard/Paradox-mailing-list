Hi Al.
I can remember when I took the photo' in Cowes of you and LITTLE JIM with the Union Flag in the background, there were two 40 foot yachts moored the other side of your pontoon and they arrived about 1/4 hour before you.
They had taken a battering in the storm force winds and lumpy seas in their crossing from the mainland. There was three 40 footers that left and one turned back because they thought it a bit rough.
The crews were a bit taken aback when you told the you had arrived just before them.

Oh yes, I had come from Poole and they were having trouble crossing from Lymington. That was one case where I would not have sailed If I had someone else aboard.

Hoping for calm nights
