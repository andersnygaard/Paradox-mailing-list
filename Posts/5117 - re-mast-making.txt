Hi Glen,

Thats wonderful news. I can't wait. By the way I noticed that you left off the big wooden fillet on the chine runners. I'm intending to do the same. I attended a talk once about induced drag in airplane wings. It was by Eugene Larabee from MIT. The focused on chordwise flow over the wings. And also some degree of spanwise flow near the wingtips. The wellknown wingtip vortices or spirals trailing in the aircrafts wake is proof of the wasted energy, or induced drag. The solution of winglets to retard spanwise flow is the abstract behind chine runners (IMHO). So therefor I think they should work better if the runners had more "edge-ing". I'm guessing that Matt was concerned at having the runners getting caught by mangrove roots or somesuch, and breaking something. All we have around here are lots of rocky beaches.

Best regards,
