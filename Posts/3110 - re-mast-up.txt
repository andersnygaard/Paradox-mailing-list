Subject: Re: Mast Up

Nice, does it fit inside ok? Or are you not storing it inside?

I probably will store it inside because I have been aworrying since someone wrote about the 
mast takers at motorway service areas. However, I haven't tried it through the hole yet (hadn't 
thought of it) and I'm hoping to be able to cut a bit off when I've adjusted for the sail, etc..

I have discovered today that the head sleeve of my sail hasn't got a cut out for the halyard 
fastening! Not to worry, I'll cut it myself and trim it with leather.

Just in case it should snap off at any time I can report that it is 
possible to scull 3.25 nM without any immediate suffering (No wind  
this morning, and I had to be home for lunch!)

Sounds like a motor job to me!
