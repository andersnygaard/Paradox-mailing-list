Subject: Re: Minimalist sail-inside designs - now Unsubscribing...

My emailed posts have the link to unsubscribe.  The most unread part of my emails.  I almost never go to the web site to read posts, only photos and files...

Sincerely,
Gene T.

Thomas,
You need to do it yourself. Go to the very bottom of this page on the far right and click on "unsubscribe" and take it from there.
