When using the engine on 'Faith' I sometimes top up the furled sail to be clear of my head; this makes it ready for instant hoisting whenever I want to proceed under sail. I have also found I can use the yuloh when the furled sail is topped up. A tent or an awning could be deployed from a topped up boom which would be particularly useful when at anchor during a rain storm. Al uses an umbrella to good effect.
