Subject: heavy weather

I have ben a lurker on this site for a few months

I have sailed for many years now - boats up to 22 foot

can anyone tell em about how a pardox sails in a blow

how she behaves in waves, if you can play a wave pattern properly while 
hunkered down in the cabin in a blow

the boat is such as radical design

love to know
