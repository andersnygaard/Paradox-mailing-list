Subject: Re: (Taking my marbles and going away) Group

Sorry that you have come away with that impression Don. On the contrary, it has been a matter of reputation and respect that I take this community seriously. 

I have spent considerable time contributing to the group. I have enjoyed the sharing of information, which is part and parcel of this community. Recently I posted photos of my boat. You on the other hand, have not posted any photos, and you have been absent for at least eight months after the last spat which caused you to leave in a huff.

You have flamed your own customers. You have flamed the moderator of this group. You have flamed just to flame.

I feel fortunate to have identified you early on, as a fraud. The wizard had the benefit of a man behind the curtain. You Don, do not.

In closing, I would recommend that you keep handy for your new "taking my marbles and going away" group, a copy of each:

The Elements of Style, by Strunk and White
The Elements of Editing, by Plotnik
The Elements of Grammar, by Shertzer
...and any old dictionary if you choose not to use a spell checker.

You may also seek the comfort of professional therapy and family to help you with your problems.

Good luck Don.
