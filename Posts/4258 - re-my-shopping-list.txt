I'm in Essex . . . and just up the road on the outskirts of Colchester
is C.F.Anderson Timber &amp; Board: http://www.cfanderson.co.uk/contact-us.cfm
As well as BS1088 Marine ply, they keep Far East and also Tropical
plywood. They stock 10ft X 5ft in 6mm, 9mm and 12mm in Tropical plywood:

3050 x 1525 x 5.5/6mm B/BB Tropical Plywood WBP                      
    @ =A315.86/Each

3050 x 1525 x   9.0mm BB/CC Hardwood Plywood WBP                     
@ =A323.73/Each

3050 x 1525 x 12.0mm BB/CC &amp; Better Hardwood Plywood WBP        @
=A332.55/Each

Useful if for what you are making (Like my Puffin-10) it means there
are no panels to join!
