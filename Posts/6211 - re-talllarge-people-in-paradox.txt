Actually, someone has "built" a Robbsboat, they just have yet to "finish" it!

I have a Robbsboat in my boatshop. She is ready for her bottom glass, chines have all been glassed. The mast is done, rudder, and cheek also. I have yet to make her leeboard, because I'm probably going to install Chine runners. As far as I'm concerned, the CR's are as easy, or easier than the leeboard, but that is just my opinion. One fine day I hope to finish her.

Until then I solo my beachcat, or sail my hunter 23.5 with the family.
