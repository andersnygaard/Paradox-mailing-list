Subject: Re: Timber (or lumber!)

As the majority will not be on view, i think planning is throwing 
money away for nothing. What do others think.

I made the mistake of getting a lot of planed timber. Sawn is fine 
and the size of the cleats is not critical, +/- 5mm is accurate 
enough.

Hoping for calm nights
