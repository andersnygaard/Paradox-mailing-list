Subject: Re: Bigger Paradox

Hi Eliseu,

if I build the Boat, the hole building process will be documented (as always, see my other boats ) on my Website!
But first I have to get more Info's what is possible and what not...
As I said, I will not build the boat alone, because I have no place to do that, I live in the City in a flat. If I would rent a place, it would be more expensive as going to a boat builder, crazy world up here....
Hope someone here in the forum can help out with some info's regarding a 20% bigger Paradox ! I can't find anything of help regarding that topic ...
