After I had cut out my bulkheads I stood them in a row to get some 
idea of the fell of the final boat. It was a waste of time, the 
impression I get was all wrong. For one thing the construction is 
much more sturdy, so you can lean on bits without them moving. For 
another the boat is much larger inside when finished.

No side cleats on B'hd 3. Side cleats on the aft face of B'hd 4 
(dotted line = hidden detail)


I just used a jig saw, no planing up afterwards. Don't put the bevels 
on until after the first trial fit or you will find you have cut them 
wrong (like I did).

Yes

I used DF throughout. The sheer bent ok, but the chine was a pig. If 
I were doing it again with DF I would laminate the chine in situ from 
at least 2 layers.

Epoxy is your friend and will fill any gaps you have. I kept telling 
myself that the epoxy is stronger than the ply so my cock-up has 
resulted in a stronger construction. Sometimes I believed it.

During the '70s I worked for a while on the excavation of the Mary 
Rose (Henry VIII flag ship, until it sank in the Solent). While 
working on one of the main ribs I came across a bit where the 
carpenter had cut out a rebate for the stringer, found it was in the 
wrong place and filled it with a block of wood nailed in. Even the 
King's master craftsmen got it wrong occasionally.
