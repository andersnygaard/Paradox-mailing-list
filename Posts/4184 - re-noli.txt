Hi Jeff,

- I found your sketch and pictures of the boat under construction in the photo album. - very nice - a couple of more feet do seem to offer quite a bit more room.

- still waiting for approval on the microcruisingpics site. I also discovered many photos on several Bris boats... interesting designs

Thanks
George
