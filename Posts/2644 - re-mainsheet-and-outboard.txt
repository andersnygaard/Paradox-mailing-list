Hi Derek,

I have just put a little sketch in with the photos and below.
This shows an idea for fitting a horse to clear an outboard motor.
You would have to fit the motor first then work out the height to suit the clearance.
This idea could be moved on to have the horse fitted to the transom with the stays on the deck to give the main sheet the same angle as on Matt's drawings.
The best way to work out the size and shape of a horse is to make it out of scrap copper tubing or even small section timber glued together then take it to someone that can make it out of stainless steel.
