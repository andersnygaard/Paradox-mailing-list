Subject: Re: Hey Alaistar (and others). What did you use to thicken your epoxy and how is going after all these years?

Yes. The real trick is in how finely you grind up your microphones. I use a garden mulcher for this, followed by three passes through a coffee grinder at ever finer settings. Finely powdered microphones are a very good structural filler for epoxy. :-D
