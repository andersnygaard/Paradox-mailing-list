I suspect that anything on the transom would be too high up to be any use.

The plans include some very nice shetches of larger versions of the Paradox and I will be relying on them for my mods, including a small platform on one side the transom for getting in and out of water and an oversized trolling motor on the other side for some limited electric cruising.

The existing design already has a very handy boarding step built into the rudder

Hoping for calm nights
