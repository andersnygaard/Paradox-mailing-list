Hi Bill,

Here's a little more info on my boat:
Steve Henderson  
boat unnamed as yet
per plan
US Kansas City
under slow construction (other higher priority projects)

Thanks for putting the table together..I was not aware of it until
seeing the link on Paradoxbuilders.  I've looked at your site before,
but not recently..maybe that's why I wasn't aware of the table.

Steve
