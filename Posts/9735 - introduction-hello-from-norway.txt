Subject: Introduction / Hello from Norway

Hi,

Just a quick introduction here. My name is Anders and I live in the south of Norway, close to the sea and the inland canals of Telemark. I've had several boats over the years, both sailboats and motorboats. At the moment I only have a kayak for when I go hunting.

I was introduced to the Paradox and Matt Layden's boats by a fellow Scandinavian, Sven Yrvind some ten years ago. I made a model using cardboard and fiberglass in order to wrap my head around the concept. At the time I lived in a small apartment in Oslo.

Now, I've got more space, more tools, more skills (albeit not so much more time, funny that). I enjoy doing projects that are a bit over my head, hopefully mastering some new tools and skills along the way - like this summer when I bought a stick welder and built myself a Texas style 100 gallon offset BBQ smoker on wheels. It turned out all right. I've made a range of projects out of wood like tables, desks, closets, cutting boards, and kitchen cabinets, but I'm by no means an expert.

I've been looking for a long-term project and recently bought the plans for the Paradox. My plan was to start with parts that can be stored somewhere else before committing floor space, so I started with the mast. The yard, boom, transom, rudder, stem and bulkheads including junction box can also be prepared before assembling the hull, as far as I can figure.

This forum is full of great posts. It'll come in handy in the process. You will hear from me when I'm out of ideas or need input from more experienced builders.

Take care,
Anders
