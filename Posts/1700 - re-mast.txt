Larry Pardey describes how to build a box girder mast in one of the "Seraffyn" books, including how to build up the inside at places where you attach things like winches and other fittings. IIRC, he talks about timber selection, specifies 12:1 or longer scarphs for timbers, talks about taper and rounding off (he just rounds off the leading edges and leaves the aft edges square, but the aft edges can be rounded too). He also puts a roll of crumpled aluminimum foil all up and down the inside as the biggest rader reflector around!

There are definitely other sources for information on building a wooden mast. Bud Macintosh's book might be one.

If you're a really good woodworker and don't mind a brush with insanity, the pinacle of the mast maker's art is the bird's mough - many long skinny bits (like barrel staves) with just the right rabits in each side all come together to make a mast... It's got to be maddening if you've never done it before!
