Subject: Re: Enigma

Deric, you are right, there are no official plans for the Enigma. However, the basic plan is available online with notes from Matt=E2=80=99s original build. I will be building from it, starting soon I hope, I have made a model and it looks right. I would like to have a lighter boat than my Paradox for exploring places which do not have a boat ramp.

Here=E2=80=99s the link:

Looking forward to warm sailing weather, it=E2=80=99s minus 20 here again today. All one can do here is dream, or maybe go ice sailing if brave enough.

Cheers!
