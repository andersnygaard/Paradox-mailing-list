Hi Kevin,

Yes. Much food for thought. Thank you.

Initially I was curious about building bigger just for the increase in waterline length and that bit of extra space inside. I'm six feet tall.

Lately, I've hurt my lower back and I'm noticing getting in and out of my MX5 (Miata) has become difficult to do comfortably. I wonder if I can even sit inside a Paradox for a few hours at a stretch! (without a stretch) :-)

Like you I've become completely intrigued by the design though.

I think I need to mock up the whole thing at the designed size in cardboard, heel it over a bit and sit inside reading a book for six hours and see how I go. Maybe camp a night or two in it. If that seems okay I'll build at that size. If it seems just a little too small I'll mock it up 20% bigger (figuring I might as well take all the increase I can get from the design) and see how it is then.

Yes, increasing the length multiplies the time and materials cost more than intuition would suggest. I have to make sure I stay aware of that along the way. If it ends up too heavy to tow behind my (other) car then I have an excuse to keep it on a mooring ball in the river and sail it more often. :-D

Thank you for the reply. I'll keep you posted.

Matt.
