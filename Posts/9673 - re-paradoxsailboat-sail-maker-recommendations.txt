Dabbler Sails made Zoe's second sail and it was perfect. The first was built by a local sail maker who had no idea what he was doing. Dabbler had me support the yard on two chairs with a, if memory serves, 30 lb weight in the middle and record the deflection at given points.

Thank you for the advice. This is what I have run into, hesitation from local sail lofts about a roller reefing lug. I have a quote with sailrite, other than that I have no interest in being a guinea pig for a sail maker. I want it done right as I plan on doing fairly epic journeys while pushing my paradox hard.

Best regards,
Cory
