Subject: Hi from a Newbie........

Howdo all,

My name is Charlie, and I have just joined your group after coming across the Paradox in some discussions on another small sailboat group, of which I am a Moderator. I am in the Southwest of the UK (Devon), and at the moment I have a Silhouette that I am in the very slow process of converting to junk rig.

Initially, I would like to ask a couple of questions, I can't quite figure out how those bilge runners work, nor how they prevent the Paradox making excessive lee way???

Best,
Charlie.
