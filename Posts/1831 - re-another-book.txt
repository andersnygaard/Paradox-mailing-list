Bill,

I just finished your book(A Speck on the Sea). Great book!! However, it presented more questions about the capsule boats that are driving me crazy! For instance, how do the carry enough food aboard those really small boats? How do they cook it, (if they cook it)? Also, I would like to see some cutaway type drawings of how these boats are built and laid out. The technical details of the workings of the really small ones are most intriguing. The photos are excellent but they can't answer all of these questions. I am also interested in your plans for Paradox that you hinted at in the previous post. Again, I really loved your book.
