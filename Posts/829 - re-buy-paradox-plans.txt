What a great site. The pictures are great and over whelming. It seems very complex especially warping the wood with steam and bending the sides.
I didn't see any space for a motor, is that an option?
Also didn't see a picture of the bottom. The inch thick flat bottom interests me.
I assume that you had detailed plans and got them from Don. Yes??

If you are serious about building then Dons 'how to build' articles 
are almost an essential.

The essential tools are quite modest. The ones I use most are a 
battery drill/screwdriver and a jigsaw. Oh yes, and a hammer!

I would class my skills not so much as woodworker more as 
bodger. But even I have found it difficult to mess up.

The construction process is such that there is always a trial fit 
before the glue is added, so cock-ups are not fatal.

Apart from moving full sized sheets of ply, and turning the hull over 
in the confines of a garage (cunning use of roller skates) I have 
managed the whole assembly single handed. See 
www.asjg.clara.co.uk/little_jim/little_jim.htm for the results so far.
