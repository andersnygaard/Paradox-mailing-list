Subject: Questions on fiberglass butt joint and cleaning blush off epoxy
Date: Sun, 26 Feb 2012 21:52:22 -0000

Hello,

I have some questions about joining two sheets of plywood with a fiberglass butt joint and cleaning blush off epoxy. Would you please be able to help me out?

For the fiberglass butt joint, I am wondering if I should fiberglass and epoxy one side, wait for it to cure and then flip it over and fiberglass/epoxy the other side? Or, is there a way to saturate fiberglass tape with epoxy on the bottom side, lay the plywood pieces on top of it and then fiberglass/epoxy the top side all at one time? If so, how do I keep the 'bottom' piece of fiberglass straight without wrinkles?

Also, after I apply a bead of epoxy to the inside chines, how do I clean off the blush after it cures and before I apply a layer of fiberglass tape and epoxy? Is it necessary to wash the epoxy bead or sand it? Additionally, how do I get access to clean a thin bead? I understand how to clean the blush off a flat surface, but I'm confused with a small bead.

Thank you for your help.

Best regards,
Dave
