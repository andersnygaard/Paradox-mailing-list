Subject: How to attach an anchor to Paradox

Last year on microcruising I asked for advice how to anchor a Paradox, and was told to have a line at the bow which gets tied to the anchor rode and takes the load. The remaining part of the anchor rode is led back where I can get at it without foredeck acrobatics.

Looking at the bow, I now wonder about the best way to attach that secondary line. I don't know whether the cleats are intended to take the strain, and I worry about chafe where the line would lead over the deck. Derek also put a loop through a hole in the bow. I am not sure that is suitable, because the edges of the hole are relatively sharp compared to the line diameter, so I worry about chafe again. It occurred to me that the simplest solution would be to put a big U-bolt through the stem. That piece of wood looks quite chunky. My first question is whether I should still reinforce the stem if I go for a U-bolt.

I have thought of two more alternatives: One is to put some thick plywood over the hole through the bow, so that i can have a nicely rounded exit for the loop. The other is to get a really chunky D-ring, like those used on safety harnesses, and laminate that to the bow. That would spread the load out very nicely.

The U-bolt needs the least work, and as I have little time before my last opportunity for a holiday this year, it's my preferred option if it is structurally good enough. Can anyone comment on that?
