Subject: Re: leeboards?

Welcome aboard.

As Dave said there are no leeboards or centreboard. There's quite a bit of info on chine runners out there if you look around.

Dave's quote above is very apt because Sven has extrensive experience with the chine runner design and is currently building his own 15 footer, a joint design effort between him and Matt.

As he says:
"After a decade studying Paradox, and talking to Matt I have come to understand that the boat's leeway-resistance comes from a combination of three sources, the chinerunners, the lifting body shaped hull and the large rudder."

There's no better place to start understanding Paradox than reading the chapter from Sven's book entitled Chapter 9 (in the files section of this group).
Also have a look at his blog about the new boat.

Scroll all the way to the bottom for the design thoughts on this and other Matt Layden designs.

Hope that helps
