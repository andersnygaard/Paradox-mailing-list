I also would be interested in knowing if anyone has fitted an outboard to a Paradox and with what results. I seem to recall seeing a photo of Little Cruiser with one. Was the outboard on Little Cruiser found to be unsatisfactory in some way? Anyone ---- ?
Cheers,

Given the state of my back I would need an outboard on a Paradox. Is it possible to run and control one from inside Paradox with the hatch closed? Has anybody experience of using a Paradox with an outboard?
Thanks
