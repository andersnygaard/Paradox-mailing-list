I've been busy putting together the cabin superstructure. Now the
thing that has me puzzled is the f'wd beam. The bottom of the window
is curved, and yet the upper beam is shown as straight. This leads to
a quite pronounced rolling bevel on the corner posts. I'm thinking
that it would be easier to put some curvature into the upper f'wd
beam. I don't have any lexan yet so don't know how flexible it will be
to bend to this curve, but at present it doesn't seem quite right.
I've cut a piece of cardboard but it's not stiff enough to properly
follow the compound curve.

Am I barking up the wrong tree?

You are, a little. The upper beam is straight in the plan view, but 
is curved in the front view, so the actual shape is quite 
complicated. I sorted this by standing in the boat, with an angle 
grinder and coarse sanding disc, and sighting between the roof beam 
and the deck beam to produce a freehand profile. 

It would appear to have worked ok :-)
