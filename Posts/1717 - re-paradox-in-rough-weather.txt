Hi Bill,

I have read about and heard personal experiences of deploying an 
anchor off the bow as an aid in hoving too. Bolger suggests that the 
resistance of the rode below, in quieter water may be as effective as 
a chute near the surface.

Another advantage is that if you get blown towards a lee shore the 
anchor may begin to drag and slow you even more. This could be a bit 
risky I suppose - if the anchor hooked really solidly and started to 
pull your bow down.

In canoeing we often use a bucket for an anchor. Just put some rocks 
in it (Mostly when fishing.) Dragging the empty bucket on a rode 
works well when caught out on the lake in a blow. The bucket ideally 
attached to a "bridle" - a length of line that runs from one seat 
thwart to the other - passing under the bow - so the bucket 
resistance does no pull down on the bow.

This was common practice in the "old days" as this bridle was also 
used when "lining" downstream, or "tracking" upstream, through 
rapids:-)

Cheers, Nels
