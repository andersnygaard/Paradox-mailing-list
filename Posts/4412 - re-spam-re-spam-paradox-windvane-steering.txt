I have a fascination with wind vanes Bill, and just wanted to try to 
adapt one to Zo\xc3\xab, The Paradox has incredible  longitudinal stability and 
I actually steered very little on this last trip. I like to go off shore 
and spend at least an overnight occasionally, therefore, I wanted 
something that would hold a course for hours on end without the 5 or 10 
min. tweaking. Because of her longitudinal stability the vane will have 
a very easy time of it.

I was unable to find the pictures I had so give me a few more days to 
post some. I will have to repair the vane oar and then remount to get 
good shots.

Hi Glen,

All this is ingenious. I gave up on a windvane for 'Faith' because I
could not overcome the problems; therefore I'm pleased you have
worked out how to do it. Several of my boats have had windvane servo
systems for easy single-handed sailing. I was relying on what people
had told me about Paradox's canny course-keeping characteristic. I
imagined she would hold her course like Slocum's 'Spray'!!

I'm looking forward to the photos and eventually the drawings. That
will be a great service.

Many thanks,
Bill.
