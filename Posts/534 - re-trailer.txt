Hi all,

I have been bending my mind towards building the trailer for my paradox. Now that the bottom is on I can cart it off to local trailer builders and see what can be done. 

I want to be able to launch/recover off a slip into the water without getting the wheels/brakes wet, and also unload/load it onto a flat surface, such as a beach when the tide is out.

Have either of you got any 'must have' or 'avoid' ideas, before I part with some cash?

Hoping for calm nights
