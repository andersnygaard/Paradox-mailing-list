Hi,

Work has started on my Norwegian Paradox! I'm currently documenting my build on Instagram under the hashtag #paradoxboat, but I'll be happy to drop a more distilled gallery of pictures on this site as well, as it is still one of the best sources documenting every thinkable aspect of this boat.

I started slowly, experimenting with the tasks I initially thought was going to be the hardest, making the tack strop, the mast, casting the lower gudgeon for the rudder, melting lead. I enjoy learning new skills and none of this turned out to be a dealbreaker, so I moved on to making the bulkheads and transom. Next up is the rudder.

I was lucky to source materials before the great price surge, but okoume plywood proved difficult to get hold of in my country. Instead, I'm using exterior grade Baltic birch BB/BB quality, which is a bit heavier and a less flexible. I'm following the recommended specs - 9-12-18mm bulkheads, 12mm transom, but plan to do 12mm for bottom, 9mm for sides and 6mm for the deck.

At night, I'm scouring the internet for inspiration - this site, the Facebook group, YouTube, build blogs, there's a lot out there. Add me to Instagram if you've got something interesting on your profile or like to follow my build, leave a reply here if you've got some interesting links or videos to share with the rest of us!
