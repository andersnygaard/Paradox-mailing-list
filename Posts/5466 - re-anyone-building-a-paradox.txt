Hello Stephen,

My life has taken a turn and I will not in the near future be building a Paradox or micro-cruiser. I am on the west coast now, in Nanaimo, and would like to connect with you sometime and see one of these things in the flesh ....so to speak. Anyway congrat's on getting this far, and many of us are looking forward to reports of sailing and cruises and voyages.

JG

Hi Bill. I'm building a paradox. I'm just finishing up now and I should be launching this month sometime. I'm waiting for a sail kit to arrive from SailRite. You can see something of my boat in the photos section under Ironsides. Good Luck, Steve ,on Puget Sound.
