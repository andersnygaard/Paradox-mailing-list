Try mbolduc@triad.rr.com. This is Dave Bolduc. I purchased my plans from him, but he may be off sailing at this time. Also karen.matt@juno.com. This is Matt's email address. This is all of the info I have.

Hello again everyone.

I'm getting very desperate. I'm not having any luck what so ever 
trying to get ahold of plans, book, ect. I'm really getting worried 
that I may never be able to build the Paradox at all because of this.
I don't know what e-mail address to use, after trying out 2 of them, 
and both coming back to me saying somekind of problem with the addy.
Should I just give up on this and move on to another boat? Perhaps 
the plans are no longer around? Or maybe Matt is sailing off somewhere 
in the wild blue.
Did you ever have the feeling of wanting something so bad, that it 
create's a whole new type of emotion that is hard to explain? Anybody 
relate?
Well thanks all. I'm hoping somebody can help out.

Jeff
