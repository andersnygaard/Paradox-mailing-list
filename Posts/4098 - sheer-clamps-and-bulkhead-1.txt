Subject: Sheer clamps and bulkhead #1.

I,m jumping away ahead of myself here, but I'll ask as the questions arise.
I noticed on Bill's photos that the sheer clamp is notched about 500mm from the stern (i.e. its not the full length of the sheer). I hadn't noticed this on anyone elses build photos where they appear to continue the full length of the sheer. Checking the plans, sheet#3 does clearly show this cutout (I think!) but can't quite work out why it's there. I think it's for clearance for the steering lines but not entirely sure. Is it necessary?

Bukhead 1.
If it's left open is it not better to put some limbers in to drain any water to the bilge?
Will the mast fit internally if the bulkhead is left solid?
I intend to open it up anyway but just curious.
