Hi James,

I read the capsize info on the af3 and it leaves me wondering. I want to build my chosen boat for use in the sea so capsizing there will be a lot different even in small waves when trying to recover.

The Paradox seems like the right boat for me going off the experiences of others but its just a little too small.

Someone else suggested building a small catamarang.

Any thoughts would be cool.

Thanks guys.
