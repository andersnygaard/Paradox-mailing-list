Roger did you ever get a response from the Bolducs?  I tried emailing twice about 6 months apart and still haven't received a response.  I'm keen to look through the plans and see if this build is achievable for myself.  I did get the Don Elliot book but the sketches are more like cartoon explanations rather than plans that show the sorts of timber etc involved.
