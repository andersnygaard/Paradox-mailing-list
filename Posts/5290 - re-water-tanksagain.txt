okay...do this then.....

find a nice water tight hatch mechanism you can incorpororate into the tank....

make it big enough that two litter (or what ever) sized water bottles can fit through the hatch....

put some "loose water" in the tank....fill up the rest of the space with your nicely sealed and pristine "water bottles"...

use the "loose water" for cleaning...or maybe water that gets boiled first..or emergency water.......use water bottle water for drinking or non boiling cooking...

use appropriate amounts of chlorine or whatever in both supplies to maintain sanitation...

just an idea

take care

Honestly it is because I am a little leery of drinking water from the epoxied tanks even though I will follow all the directions exactly for making them per Don Elliots book.? I have read all the documentation I can find on drinking this water and am satisfied that it would be safe. (well as safe as any water can be these days..sigh)? However it is an emotional thing and I would feel better if I only drank this water in a real emergency.? Funny the thought of cooking with it does not bother me in the least.? Purely emotional, human brain thing.

May I ask...

Why do you want to do this?

Is it because you dont want to drink nasty?tank water...

or is it because you are afraid the tank may leak and/or contaminate your whole water supply?

take care

Rod,
The bags sound good but would be no guarantee that water bag leakage 
or water coming in the hatch would not get into the void around the 
bag. This would need to be dried out regularly.

Sincerely,
