Subject: Re: Paradox tacking difficulties

Hi Rob,

I wonder if I can add a little to that?

We think of Paradox as a flat-bottomed boat,  which is true when she's still in the water or resting on a beach.
When sailing,  however,  she's a deep-V with a dihedral of about 40deg.   The immersed chine runner is then a long,  asymmetric keel.
Long keeled boats are renowned for their tracking and for their reluctance to change tack.
Fin keeled boats are known for their reluctance to keep a course and for alacrity in changing tack.
We can't have it both ways!

If Paradox could be sailed upright I would agree that the chine runners would inhibit vortex formation around the chine.
A long keel has a significant,  helical vortex to windward:  this vortex helps resist leeway.
Paradox's "long keel" (the submerged chine runner) is canted to leeward:  I imagine the vortex is less than that of a long keel (as you say) and I would imagine resists leeway better.

Best wishes,

John
