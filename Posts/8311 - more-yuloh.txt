Alistair is right, it is more efficient to have the rudder up while using the Yuloh.  You steer by putting more pressure on the left or right stroke depending on direction wanted.  However, when there is wind and one can’t sail, in a narrow channel for example, I find it necessary to keep the rudder down to steer the boat.  Then it is a bit of a pain to reach down to the steering ropes.  I gave some thought to adding a steering tiller above the back deck for this purpose, but I couldn’t bear to do without the nice flat surface which is so very handy for filleting fish, washing dishes, drying out the anchor, showering and so on.
