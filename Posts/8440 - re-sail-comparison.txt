Enigma's sail isn't any better than a well-made Paradox sail; however, I've seen quite a few lug sails sewn by amateurs and professionals alike that didn't have enough draft to pull these heavy little sharpies along. Luckily, Matt did a wonderful job shaping this 12 footer's sail, and it has carried me through 3 Watertribe Challenges and a cruise out and back from the Bahamas. Nonetheless, I too have experienced firsthand the letdown from an improperly designed sail for this style of boat. When we first got Little Cruiser we replaced her worn-out homemade creation with one from a well-known sailmaker in New England. However, after spending $700 on that fancy piece of dacron, we soon discovered that the sail was cut too flat and that our sailboat was measurably slower than before. Therefore, I spoke about the situation to Matt Layden and Mark Balogh, another wonderfully talented small boat designer and professional sailmaker, and they inspired me to try my hand at making my own. Subsequently, I took careful measurements of the faded original; read the few books I could find on the subject like the Sailmakers Apprentice; acquired a cheap old commercial sewing machine (Singer 143-W2); and then created a fairly handsome sail that carried us as swiftly as before on our long distant cruises. Of course, my first sail wasn't perfect, but the few mistakes I made were correctable, and I learned a lot in the process. Still, sailmaking isn't for everyone, and for many, it might be wiser to search out the right sailmaker who understands the needs of a heavy displacement microcruiser.

Dave,

Could you comment further how Enigma's sail is better made than Paradox's sail? Is Enigma's sail design better, or was it just better constructed?

...As for windward performance, I would have to say that Enigma might be the best amongst the lot, which is probably due to her lower overall deck profile and an especially well-made sail. Of course, this is just my feeling. Matt probably would disagree. Nonetheless, I just love sailing that little boat to the weather. She just climbs and climbs and climbs upwind....
