Subject: Re: Removing boat from trailer (was Paradox Trailer Bolt)

Hi here's my boat being rolled over
We lifted it the same way
A long tow strap , called a snatch step here in Oz
Then pulled up with a chain block from the shed roof 
I've lifted a steel beam using best quality sailing pulleys and stout sailing rope
The tractor sounds handy 


I had a friend steady the boat
I had thick woven plastic bags under it
