Subject: Re: Batteries as ballast?

I just read today in an article about Lance Armstrong that the average cyclist in good shape can put out 200 watts for 20 minutes.(Lance can do 500 for  twice that)

with a conversion multiplier of .00134 , that comes to about .27 hp

Of course, that's on an efficient machine, and it's only for 20 minutes, and it's with leg and torso  power, and there is probably no beer gut  involved----

I dunno- half that?
