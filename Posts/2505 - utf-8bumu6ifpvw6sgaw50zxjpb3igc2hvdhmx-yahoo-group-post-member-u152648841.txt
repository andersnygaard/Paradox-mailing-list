Hi Wes and thank you.

No you are correct, I did not install the foam in Zo. Never had an unsinkable boat before and have survived 45 years of sailing and most recently a trip across the Atlantic with Chris Morejohn in his modified sharpie Hogfish Maximus. My primary concern was being able to inspect behind the foam for dry rot or accumulated moisture. Don Elliott gave me a lot of grief about that and called me all kinds of names like unsafe sailor blah, blah, blah. I like the idea of an unsinkable boat but often wonder if the foam was not meant more for insulation then unsinkability being that so much of it is in the deck head above the tiller port opening. I also didn't want to give up precious volume in so small a boat and wanted to be able to mount things solidly to hull sides ect. I later came up with a way to have my cake and eat it too by installing the foam to door skins and then mounting them to blocks glued to the hull sides and deck head. A review of the files section should turn up the article I wrote about it.
