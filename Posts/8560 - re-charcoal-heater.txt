Hi Woodersonj.

I do use a a kerosene pressure lantern sometimes on my Paradox, but must admit it's not vented with its own flue pipe.

As you rightly say it's a very good heater, giving more heat than the little charcoal burner.

But the sliding hatch has be open a bit to let the fumes out and prevent the cabin from getting Hot enough to melt me. So I only use it for a short time.

Best
Jim
