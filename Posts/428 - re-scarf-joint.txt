Susan,

A butt block will work, but may not give you as fair a curve as a scarf. Don't be intimidated by a scarf joint: they are easier than you think. Once upon a time, it was important to have a perfect scarf because the glues relied on a tight joint for strength. With today's epoxies, the glue is stronger than the wood, so they don't have to be perfect. If you strive for a nice joint and use epoxy, everything will work out fine. You might practice on some of the scrap left over from making the bulkheads.

Tailwinds,
Glen
