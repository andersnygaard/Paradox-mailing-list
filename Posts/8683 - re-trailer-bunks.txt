My ballast is forward of bulkhead 3.

BUT it moved about a bit before it ended up there. At one time some
of it was bolted to bulkhead 4. I have no outboard but my two anchors
are either side of bulkhead 4 and my battery is next to bulkhead 3.

The important thing is to get the trim right (as shown in the plans).

As I have added heavy equipment I have adjusted the ballast to
compensate.

I'm looking into buying a trailer at the moment.  My first idea was to
have an extendable tongue or perhaps a hinged arm attached to the
drawbar that I can use at launch time to get the trailer deeper into
the water.  I was going to have transverse bunks under bulkheads 2 and
4 and float the trailer onto them (my last boat had that system, but
it didn't have ballast and it was multichine with stitch and glue). 
Now that I've started considering ballast, perhaps this isn't the best
way.  Should I have a transverse bunk under bulkhead 1 and two
longitudinal bunks centered under bulkhead 3 and the chines? Once the
water ballast is removed will she sit nose up enough to not need a
guide up to the bulkhead 1 bunk? Transverse bunks could be made in a U
shape to automatically secure the boat once she's on the trailer.
Longitudinal bunks won't do that so I would have to use ties downs to
keep her on the trailer.

There's pros and cons to both arrangements. What do you think?

Cheers,

Rob

PS:  Jim... please don't suggest a design that involves unloading the
boat onto the slipway and waiting for the tide ;-)
