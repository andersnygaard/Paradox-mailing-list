Subject: Skidless decks

This year I redid the skidless surfacing on Little Cruiser's decks. For this task I used PETTIT's 9900 Skidless Compound, which is made of fine silicone oxide. You could also use a less expensive and heavier grit silicone oxide from Home Depot, but I find that it is a little too coarse for my tastes. What I basically do is paint the deck (or parts of it) with a coat of paint, and then I sprinkle the grit all over it using a large salt shaker. I try to distribute the silicone oxide as evenly as possible though perfection is not needed for a nice job. Once the paint dries, I blow off the loose grit with my wet/dry vac, and I paint on another coat. I usually can get several seasons of use out this application, which includes a yearly repaint. I've been told by some people that you can use fine sand as a skidless compound. However, I've also been warned that it's extremely hard to get off, which you may want to do before you reapply a fresh layer of grit. On the other hand, silicon oxide is easier to sand, though it too can wear your sand paper down quickly.
