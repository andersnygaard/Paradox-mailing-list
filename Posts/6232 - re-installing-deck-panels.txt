Subject: Re: installing deck panels


Rod,

To be honest, I doubt that it matters whether you nail them or not.
I nailed at the bulkheads, but used screws at the intermediate beams as there would be too much spring back to countersink the nails. i've no idea what size nails I used - short enough not to go all the way through the beams!
You can actually see some nail heads here:

I know that Glen did not use any mechanical fasteners at all on Zoe, and I doubt whether they actually do anything other than possibly promote rot!

I fitted all my deck panels with screws, prior to bonding, to make sure everything fitted correctly. It takes a fair bit of pressure to get the camber fwd of bulkhead 1, in fact I scored the inner ply to allow in to bend a bit easier.

Looking forward to seeing some pictures, I've been working on my spars over the last couple of weeks....
