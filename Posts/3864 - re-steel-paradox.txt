There is a excellent book which has a clearcut method for the answer to your question. "Steel Boatbuilding" by Thomas E. Colvin. ISBN 1-888671-02-5.  See Chapter six. Steel sheet at 1/8 inch thick is 5.1 pounds per square foot by the way.

Hi all,

would it be an option to build Paradox in steel?

Any comment/suggestion is welcome.
