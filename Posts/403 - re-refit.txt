I doubt if nylon is as strong as epoxy glass,  but is the nylon strong enough?
I do not know.
What effect does salt and ocean critters have on the strength of nylon?  
What effect does freezing and UV have on nylon?  Like when the boat is sitting in your side yard all winter?
Nylon is such a common material I am sure the answers are available, but I do not know were to point you.
In any case I would be interested in a case I would very much like a copy of the lower rudder fitting.
When you talk to the machine shop see if you can get a better price by saying you want two of them and let me know how much to send you.
Thanks

Hi All,

It looked like the Ply on the bottom soaked up a lot of water, So 
I ground off all the glass, and while it was still wet brushed it with 
anti-freeze. Im going to let it dry for a couple of weeks with fans 
and heat lamps before I lay the roving. I think Im on the right track.
Im looking for a cheap source for Bronze, rod stock and sch 40 pipe. West Marine has it, but its not cheap!
On the lower rudder fitting Im thinking of having it machined out of Nylon, I have a cheap source (Free), and access to a machine shop. I can get it up to 6" thick. If I make it to Matt's print do think it will be strong enough? If it will work I can have a few made if anybody is intrested? We can hold about a .000050 tol.
