Subject: Is there a Paradox in Arkansas?

I was wondering if someone in Arkansas has completed a Paradox? I'm in central AR and would love to see a Paradox in the flesh. Maybe I could meet you out sometime and see the boat and possibly go out with you for a sail. I'm about to begin building a small 18' trimaran but the Paradox is next on the list.
