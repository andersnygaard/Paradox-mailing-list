Subject: You're so Vane. . .

Glen,
   I had questions on the steering vane:  

Does your Paradox rudder have much friction on the steering rope so
that it stays put normally?  

Do you adjust this friction while sailing without the vane gear?  

Do you have to loosen or disconnect the steering rope to use the vane
gear?


Thanks,
Bill B.

P.S.  I had the pleasure of having Glen show me Zoe in Cedar Key.  The
pictures of Zoe on the internet are not re-touched photos.  Zoe really
is pretty and impressive in real life.  Glen explained Zoe's finish
and details to my wife and me for a couple of hours.  Glen is proud of
his little craft, and rightly so.
