Alan,

It seems to me that the best place should be along the centre-line, but the plans show the lead out towards the sides. I don't understand this as it means that 1/2 the ballast is then outboard of the centre of buoyancy when the boat heels and won't be helping to right the hull? Anyone got any comments on this?

This is something that has puzzled me and I too have asked about it. The best answer seems to be that it works as it is. I am replacing my water with lead in the same compartments, my anchors are under the floor behind bulkhead 3 and I'll have about 30kg of water beneath the floor just in front of bulkhead 4. An outboard on the back port (13kg?) and my own, not insubstantial, bulk anywhere in between bulkhead 2 and 4 should make a pretty puzzle for trimming the boat.

I feel safe saying this now because Al has said he'll sort the trim on my launch day, and I have it in writing :0)
