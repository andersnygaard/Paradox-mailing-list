Subject: Re: Roller reefing hull attachment?

Hi Dave,

Thank you very much! That is what I have been looking for.

I do have two questions:

1. Is the metal rod that goes into the center of the roller/boom secured inside in some manner?

2. From the photos it appears that the "standpipe" enters the top of the cabin. Is this true, and if so, how is the standpipe attached inside the cabin?

Thanks again,

Bill
