Subject: Re: Jack gardiner's Tack Strut &amp; Boom Axle

Just wanted to add some details on this,

The pictures are of what I put together very quickly. The sheave that the furling rope goes thru comes on a plate that is seizeable with a hose clamp running though it, I will dig up the part number. that part alone does not sieze to the axel. a sleeve is made from the same stock as the pipe to make the dia of the axel bigger, it also spins freely on the axel so, at whatever angle it goes to it does not bind, it just moves to where it wants to be. then I made 2 stops with 2 hose clamps, but what I plan to do is make formal stops out of the same brass pipe and drill tap and put a set screw in each one to make them adjustable and perhaps spin even easier, if the wall thickness isnt enough to hold threads, il try brazing on a nut or something. Then I will clean up the whole assembly. It works very well. After much use the threads on the SS screw is minimal, Im going to a locking nut and cut the bolt off, perhaps even go to the next size bolt, 1/8th inch is shown. I will disasemble it and give the measurments on the end notches in the pipe. I used a fiber disk cutoff wheel to make the notches. you could also just drill then hacksaw it out, then sand the edges.
