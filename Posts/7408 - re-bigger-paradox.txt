Subject: Re: Bigger Paradox

Roberto,

If you go on my website you will see how I use my boats! Mostly on Rivers or coastal cruising. I will use the boat here in Europe, for the inland waterways the Danube River, lakes in Finnland and so on! Later than I will ship the Paradox to Canada and there I will use the boat on Rivers and Lakes (Great Slave Lake, Great Bear) Intercoastal waterway and the Inside Passage...

Mostly I will go under engine anyway, but never know maybe I will use the Sail often... What I need is shallow draft and enough space to sleep, cook and for my equipment. But the boat has to be just a little big bigger than the normal Paradox, I thing about: LOA - 5.04m LWL - 4.92m BEAM - 1.47m.

What I will change too is the Rudder system, I don't like holes in the back of my boat's ....

If you know a Boat like a Paradox, but a little bit bigger and still with shallow draft and not too big, I would be happy to know the boat!

Regards,
Chris
