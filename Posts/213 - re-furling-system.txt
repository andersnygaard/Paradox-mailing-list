Hi Glen,

This is very interesting! Many time I've tried to visualize how well the unique Paradox reefing system would work. So it is great to read your experience with it.
I cannot see what you would be doing wrong. 
I had a good look at the plans again and all I can guess from them, is that there might be some small conflicting elements in the reefing system. In order to reef , you have to overcome a sum of unwilling factors: inertia, tension, gravity and friction.
But, I have the greatest respect for designer Matt Layden, it is unlikely that he would publish anything that is not very well tried and tested. A lot of experimentation must have been needed to arrive at this set-up. Perhaps there's a simple trick we overlook.
It would be nice to be able to ask Matt about this. Or perhaps another experienced Paradox sailor can offer help?
A thing I would try as an experiment is to set up the downhaul (" tack strop") running, to a cleat, just like the reef line. To reef then, I would not touch the halyard, but first slacken the tack strop and start rolling in the reef line. This would roll the boom up. After say 1 or 2 feet have been rolled in/up, the halyard can then be slackened and the sail lowered.( and all this repeated as needed). The beauty of this would be that the boom would not drop, would be easier to convince to start rolling, and the sails' luff and leech are its topping lift! 
However, I found this solution sitting comfortably behind my desk.. I repeat it would be best to get the opinion of someone with real Paradox experience.

Happy NewYear to you and all !!
Bert.
