Sven's boats are technologically much more complex than Matt's. Though hydrodynamically they have much in common, structurally they are quite different. The Bris boats are built using high tech composite fabric and resin (not polyester/fiberglass). The Bris boats can suffer impact damage, such as stricking a log, a sleeping what, or a floating container, and bounce back. Matt's boats may or may not be able to. Sven's sail plan strategy is also different from Matt's. Both tend to "under power" their boats, but Sven breaks up the sail into component parts.

Hope that helps,
