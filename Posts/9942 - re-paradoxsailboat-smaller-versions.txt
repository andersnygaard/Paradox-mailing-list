Hi Molly,

As far as I know, there are still no plans available for Enigma.

André-François Bourbeau built his own version of Enigma. He has construction pictures on his Facebook page, under photos (scroll quite a bit down the page). I forget what the dimensions are. There are a couple of pictures that show wheels outside the chine runners; I don't know how well the wheels work.
He also designed and built several 8 foot Puddle Duck Racers with a cabin based on Enigma and cruised extensively with them. It is called Gorfnik. There are plans available and I intend to build one.

This video shows construction photos of Southern Cross, an Enigma inspired boat.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DYhZsdJqzMA8

I put together a page about Enigma many years ago. I'm not sure if all the links still work.  https://aiki.pbworks.com/w/page/1594388/Enigma%20sailboat

Let us know how you make out!

Dave
