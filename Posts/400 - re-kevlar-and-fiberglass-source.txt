Hi David,

When I first 'mooted' the subject of Kevlar for the bottom of PARADOX, I was thinking more of scrounging the stuff from a boatbuilder or even paying a small sum. The price you were qouted was mugs 'price' not wholesale.

Find a yard that builds the odd high tech race boats, get friendly with them, then after a few days " got a bit of Kevlar to spare, I only need 5 sq metres. I've got cash, no receipt" They might have an end of a roll stashed away doing nothing. A friend use to make pram dinghies from tear off's in mould shops. when the glass was laid into the mould, the material was cut or torn to shape. the scraps were thrown into a large cardboard box for later use. It never was so it was chucked out or like my friend did, paid someone on the door a couple of quid for it. The US is probably the same.

Half the fun of building boats at home, if you've no shame, is the money you can save. Tell them any old guff, but get the price down.
