Hi Cathy

Sand Flea is quite similar to a lot of 8ft pram dinghies and there are numerous plans available.An 8ft pram is a much quicker project than a paradox and will give you an idea of whether or not you would enjoy a bigger project.If you are not already aware of the pd racer have a look at www.pdracer.com.This is a simple dinghy which can be finished in a lot of different ways and has a very active band of supporters.There is also a yahoo group. 
Cheers Neil
