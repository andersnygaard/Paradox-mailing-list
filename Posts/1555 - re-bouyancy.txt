Thanks to Jack & Bill for your help. That is much clearer in my mind.

I am intrigued by the thread about building in steel. Here in middle England steel is much easier to come by than marine ply, and paying a welder must be quicker than me building in wood. Has anybody been able to work out the weight of a Paradox in steel?
Would it be practical to consider the bottom, sides, and stern in steel with a wooden deck?

Cheers......Derek
