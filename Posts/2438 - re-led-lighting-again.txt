Subject: Re: LED lighting (again)

You can make your own around LED light for about $18, which comes 
out to $8 for the LEDs and $10 for the Perko replacement fresnel 
globe. 

Pictures of the light can be seen at 
http://www.microcruising.com/Graphics/led2-0004r.jpg and

The LED's are available from http://www.whitelightled.com/ while the fresnel 
globe can be found at West Marine and Boaters World.
