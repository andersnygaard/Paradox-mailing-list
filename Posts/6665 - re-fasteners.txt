Brass, bronze and 316 stainless are all expensive everywhere. I usually order mine as they are a little cheaper than from my local ACE Hardware and Lowes and Home depot are about 100 miles away from me.

I have had good luck with the following two places to order online or by mail.

DUCKWORKS sells stuff for the home builder in small quantities which has saved me from buying a huge amount of something i may only need a dozen of and their prices are reasonable when you compare with other suppliers.

I like Jamestown Distributors for what I cant get from Duckworks as they are a bit cheaper then Western Marine. Request the paper catalog because it has order forms for mail in or you can order from their HUGE online selection. The paper catalog only has about half what they have on line
