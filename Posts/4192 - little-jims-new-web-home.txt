Hi all,

A while ago I moved my building-Little-Jim web site to a new home. I recently noticed a site using the out of date web address, so I obviously haven't spread the word very effectively.

For the foreseeable future the correct web address will be <http://www.little.jim.freeuk.com>

If you have a link to my site on your website please check that it is up to date.

Thanks,

Hoping for calm nights

Al,
Yeovil, England.
