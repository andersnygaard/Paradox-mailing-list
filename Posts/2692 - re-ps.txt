Thanks to all for your advice, I think I'm closer to a decision on this now:)

One thing Derek, are those boys big strapping lads, or little ones, in the event that I have to move my Paradox then I think I too will be doing all the work with my mouth:) 

I have mixed feelings about the kit, one of the most appealing things about Paradox is the fact that I could build her from start to finish, but I suppose the important thing is to get a ship in the water.

I first noticed Paradox a long time ago, but I was hooked on the idea of a pretty boat and for me at the time that meant traditional, something like a Wee Seal, or a Humber canoe yawl type, Paradox just seemed to modernist to look at. Bit by bit I realized that if my first cruiser was that elaborate it would still be cruising in the shed at doomsday. 

Paradox is beautiful to me now anyway, I kept coming back to this unique design mainly because she has done so much in reality not just on paper.
