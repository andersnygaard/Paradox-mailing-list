Sean,
I don't think he has a website.
All the pictures are in this group.
Search for Paradox Max - Manatee.
I believe it's only 16' not 24'

If you want to go big with chine runners, then Chris Morejohn's, "Hogfish
Maximus" is the way to go!

At 44' it's no lightweight but loads of space!
I think Glen sailed the Atlantic with him.
