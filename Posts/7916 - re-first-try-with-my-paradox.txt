Subject: Re: First try with my Paradox

Hope I haven't bored you all with my beginner's rant. Perhaps others new to the Paradox will avoid my mistakes.

History suggests that they will make the same mistakes, as we all did. But that does mean that they will also get that sense of joy and achievement when they finally get it right.

Now for stronger winds...

Go for it, the boat will look after you.
