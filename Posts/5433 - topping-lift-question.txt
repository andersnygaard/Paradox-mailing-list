Subject: Topping lift question
Date: Sat, 06 Sep 2008 18:42:46 -0000

OK...

Is the topping lift used primarily for just the reefing action and then is it released afterwards?  I understand about furling it to put it  away but do you keep tension on the topping lift if you say .. have the sail reefed to half and are on a run?  Is this why the profile of zoe looks better when reefed compared to other pics of old sail plan designs?  Or is it the shorter boom?  Thanks for any help here.
