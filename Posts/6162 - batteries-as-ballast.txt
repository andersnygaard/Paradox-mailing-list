Subject: Batteries as ballast

I am still making my way through the thousands of messages, and am about halfway through, and learning much. I haven't found this mentioned yet, but perhaps it was thrown in somewhere I haven't looked.

In the opinion of current owners, is there room in the design of Paradox for batteries used as ballast in addition to (or rather than) water or lead pigs?

I ask because batteries are ridiculously heavy. Every time I think about adding lead to a boat, I can't help but think about using batteries instead.

There are some excellent marine electric engine options nowadays. I can't help but feel that there is room in the design for a modest electric propulsion engine (inboard, outboard) vs. the idea of fuel and an outboard which seems to be the current way to go. Electric is also quiet!

As for fumes and ventilation, good AGM batteries could make up for this. There are numerous sizes and designs. A small ventilation system could be incorporated into the current system as well.

As far as ballast, it would still be necessary to have plenty of pigs on hand to adjust as needed. Paradox carries a lot so I imagine that wouldn't be a problem if the right measurements and thought went into it. Naturally, it would seem like a simple and fundamentally pure boat like Paradox doesn't need too much electronic intrusion, but its worth thinking about.

Stupid idea?
