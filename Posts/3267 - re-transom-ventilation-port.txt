Does he sail with it off? I wouldn't like to try to close mine from inside in a sea, perhaps his arms are much longer than mine.

It wasn't until I actually saw Matt's Paradox that I notices his port was installed so that he could remove the cover from the inside,

Hi All,

Im getting ready for the 2006 sailing season and have a few questions
for those of you who have installed the transom ventilation port. I did
not install it for the fear of losing the cover and taking on water.
Ventilation has not been a big problem for me, but in my opinion, you
can never have too much ventilation, especially here in the south with
the heat.

1)Has anybody had any trouble with the port? Losing the cover? putting
the cover on in rough weather? (Hanging over the transom?)

2)Is there a significant difference in air flow with the cover off vs
on?

3) Any opinions on the subject?

Best Regards
