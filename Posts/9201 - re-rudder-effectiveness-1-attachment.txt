I've just uploaded a photo of my Paradox trimmed properly. Notice that the transom is just kissing the water, the waterline is right where the rudder bolt is and the bow is fully immersed. That's what they should look like. To get the correct trim I had to move about 30kgs of lead forward of bulkhead 2.

Ignore the rig. A lot of adjustments have been made since that photo was taken!
