Hi Al,

This is very nice work! Congratulations!
I've printed out some of the views, they are amazingly "real".
I am still learning to work with CAD and find it not at all easy to learn. It seems I'm lacking patience..Do you have any idea how many hours it took to get this far?

Best regards,
Bert.
