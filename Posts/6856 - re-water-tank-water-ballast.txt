Subject: Re: water tank / water ballast

Hello Mark,

The only problem I have with the tanks is that the water in the tanks are used as part of your ballast for the Paradox, so if you are away on a weekend journey, as you use the water, your ballast is getting less. This is why I like the water bottle solution because as you drink/use the water, you can refill the water bottles with sea water or river water to keep the ballast right. If you don't use water bottles, you need to shift the stuff inside around to make up for the lost ballast.

There are definitely pros and cons for both.
