Hi Jim,

Here's a link from Sven Yrvind where he suggests that somehow Matt
Layden managed to self-steer directly downwind in his Paradox by
relocating his lug sail to resemble a square rigger. How would he have
done that? Did he have extra long lines for his reefing drum and tack
downhaul?  If he also moved the location of the yard attachment point,
I can see that he could turn his lug into a square sail, but I doubt
the reefing system would work, so this idea would only apply in very
light winds.

In my experience it is not the wind, but the waves, that are the 
problem for self-steering. I have managed to sail for hours at a 
time, on all points of sail, in smooth water, even with quite a large 
swell. Once a short chop blows up then the hull is knocked off course 
and it all starts to go wrong.

If I felt the need for some sort of automatic steering control I 
would go for electric.

If I am expecting my battery to get low I carry a small generator 
which charges it up in a couple of hours. I usually carry a mains 
charger so I can charge from shore power, though I have only ever 
used it once.
