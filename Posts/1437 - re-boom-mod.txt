All of the NS (new sail) series pictures in the Zoe folder of the photo section are of the new sail. Unfortunately I don't have one of the sail furled but the extra cloth really isn't much of a problem. I put the yard in the rack first and drop the boom with rolled up sail on top of it. The "Old Sail" can be seem in the comingin picture. I can't give you a good comparison of the two sails because the original was so poorly cut. One day I hope to get with Matt again and we will have a little race and see how it stacks up to his.
