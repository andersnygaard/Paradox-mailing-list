In the forepeak, forward of bulkhead 1, I store a watertight tub with a complete change of clothing, towel, space blanket etc. for cases of dire emergency. It goes in at the start of the season and stays there.

I have lined the floor of the cabin with rubber matting intended for garages and workshops. This makes it much more comfortable while sliding in.

In the forward storage area I have removed the internal partition and replaced it with a bungee fence. This greatly reduces the contortions required to retrieve items.

As one of the things I keep in the forward storage is a bicycle I needed a bit more height so I dropped the floor to match the cabin, and opened up the hatchway to match. Among other things this means you can stick your feet into the storage area if you need extra sleeping length.

One solution I have seen to the storage access problem, on a different boat but with a similar difficulty, was to put everything in cloth bags, each with a string attached. when the bag goes in the end of the string stays out, so you can just pull the appropriate string and hope that the bag comes out cleanly.
