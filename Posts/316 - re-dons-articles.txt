I have just sent off for a set. The following is a quote from Don's reply to my inquiry.

I have the Paradox articles ready for immediate shipping. There are some fifty pages and 16 articles. The articles cover a detailed description of Paradox along with building instructions. The price of the series is $8.00 plus $2.00 shipping. If you live overseas the cost is $8.00 plus $4.00 shipping. Most oversea send cash, covered well in thick bond paper. Send your order to Don Elliott, 711 Wisconsin Ave, Box 202, Tomah, Wisconsin, 54660. You articles will be sent the same day I receive the order. Personal USA check is fine. Thanks for the interest in the articles.
