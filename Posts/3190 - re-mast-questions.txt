'Major Bloodknock' could also be appropriate, depending on how exciting your sailing is... Then of course there's 'Neddie SEAgoon'! or even 'The Famous Eccles'. In fact nearly all 'those' names have a nice ring to them.

In my case its a bit of 'who wrote these knees?' the result perhaps of too many years on motorcycles. Our US members must wonder what I'm on about, but as they say,'You have to be mad, but it doesn't help'! Perhaps if I suggest 'The Alfred E Neumann' (sp?) they might get the general idea.
