Have a fantastic time, Glen. I'm really eager to read of your impressions of Hogfish Maximus, and I'd love to see some photos. 

May the wind at your back not be your own!

Hi all, 

In the next day or so Chris Morejohn and I will be weighing anchor aboard his Hogfish Maximus (Hogamus), which is basically a 38 foot version of Paradox, and striking out across the Atlantic for Portugal via Bermuda and the Azores. In my absence I would like to ask the assistant moderators to take care of any problems which might arise. We are allowing three months for the trip because we will be spending a lot of time in the Azores with a planned visit to all the islands in the group. I'll fill everyone in on the trip once I return. keep banging away on your boats, we haven't had a new launching for a while now and it would be great to return to find a couple more Paradoxes in the water.

Tailwinds

Glen
