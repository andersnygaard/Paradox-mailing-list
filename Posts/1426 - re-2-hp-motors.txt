Hi Nels.

Actually, a heavy boat will carry farther than a light boat. This is what allowed the schooners of the past, to work their way up rivers, even through the bends.

As an example, imagine a Hobie 18, doing 15 knots. Now imagine a supertanker doing the same speed. Pull down the sails on the Hobie, and signal "all stop" aboard the supertanker. 

Same thing with a skateboard versus a 100 car freight train, both being on level ground. Mass carries more potential for momentum.

When you're solo paddling your kevlar canoe, you find it necessary to maintain rhythm, but when you have crew and 2 weeks of provisions and camping gear, you can rest at will; the heavy canoe will carry.

What a light boat has over heavy ones, is the greater potential for acceleration. This potential can be amazing, such as the ability of an "A cat" to blast off, doing the wind thing, or the college crew to snap off the start. The eight man scull will carry considerably farther than an A cat. The scull benefits from tremendous power, and low wetted surface, on a long waterline.

My feeling on spares of any kind, is that boaters too often augment the belt with suspenders, and then back them up too. I won't carry a spare yuloh, same as I wouldn't carry a spare diesel engine aboard a sailing auxiliary. It is important to remember that the yuloh is the auxiliary source of propulsion, not the sole source. I assume that you wouldn't carry a spare downwind sail aboard your canoe. The argument for a spare paddle, is of course, that if you lose your paddle, you're up a creek. AH hahaha. The spare Black Bart that some loser stole out of your canoe, takes up very little space or cargo carrying capacity. Course, it was free too. Sorry, I feel your pain.

There's plenty of yuloh resources on the net, though I have not found one worth the price of the Paradox plans.
