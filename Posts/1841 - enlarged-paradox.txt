Subject: enlarged paradox?

I've been snooping about for something to build for about 2 years and with what i've read about possible paradox enlargement(&amp; mr. laydens blessings) i've come full circle to where i begin.....with the paradox. Has anyone actually build one or begun construction on a scaled up version? Is it actually as simple as multipling dementions by 1.2 for a 20% enlargement. I'm i going to regret trying this? At 6'2" tall i feel i would be too cramped in the 14 footer.
Thanks for any feedback.
