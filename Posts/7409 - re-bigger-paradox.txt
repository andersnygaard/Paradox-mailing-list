Subject: Re: Bigger Paradox

send me you website. I recently bought the plant Paradox, and I thought to build. I have done other boats, and one of these was the Sztrandek, a project of 16.5 feet, 25cm waterline, lots of room and can see some pictures on my blog estaleiroartesanal.blogspot.com. The blueprint for this boat is free, and the boat is the best quality. Have 150kg of ballast used mast and sail Hobiecat 14, complete with jib 470. Once built a catamaran James Wharram Tiki 26 project, my current boat. As to the stern opening must not be dangerous because it is a protected system that does not allow water ingress. What attracted me in Paradox was the possibility of running into the cabin, the ease of placing the sea, and sail system and mast, but did not like to be too heavy for the little size. To compare, my 26 foot catamaran weighs 500kg. The hull has sztrandek 9mm and I think a lot a hull 18mm with 4mm fiberglass hull and deck 12mm 9mm. That definitely did not please me, but I liked the system of hull construction, which seems quite simplified. Wrote with google translate, and may contain errors. I'm in Brazil.
