Hi All,

On the subject of making the chine runners, there could be an easier way. The PARADOX drawing give the shapes, angles and sizes at each frame. Cut your timber to size and shape to the drawing, and then cut through the back and bottom edges leaving about 12mm thickness of wood parallel to the outside edge. As the chine aft has more of an upward sweep in it, the saw cuts could be made deeper on the bottom edge allowing the chine to form a tighter curve. The sawcuts should be spaced at about 4" to  6" apart. If the chine is bent outwards before fitting, epoxy can be sqeezed into the saw cuts. Remember that the boat has a fairly heavy chine member on the inside of the hull with glass sheathing on the outside so the construction would not be compromised. In the UK there is a saying. In glue and dust we put our trust. This saying was used long before epoxy came in use.

Do not try and fit metal to the chine runners unless you have metal working skills. The chine runners have been designed to their shape for a reason. Change the shape and you could change the windward abillity of your boat.
