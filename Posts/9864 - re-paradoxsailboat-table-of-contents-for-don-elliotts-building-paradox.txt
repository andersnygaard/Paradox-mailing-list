Very nice. Thank you for sharing this!

As Don Elliott notes in Part 5: "It was more on the order of obscure notes jotted down on a piece of wood scrap from Paradox."

I'm very thankful for the work Don and his family have put in to make this great resource available. However, it can be difficult to approach while building as the important notes can be scattered throughout the different parts.

I made this quick table of contents for myself and realized others might find it useful. The page numbers are what I see on the printed pages, not what shows up in the PDF reader. There are some spelling errors that I've left as-is so you can also search and find by the "Section Heading". A PDF version should be attached.
