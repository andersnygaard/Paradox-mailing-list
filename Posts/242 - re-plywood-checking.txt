Subject: Re: Plywood checking

Thanks for your reply Glen. I learned a lot building my Junebug. I won't use fir plywood again on any boat I build, I want to make sure that all my effort won't be spent on a boat that I don't enjoy looking at. Even if a fir boat were to last for many years I personally wouldn't get as much enjoyment out of it if the finish was rough due to checking.
I looked at a Searunner 31 a while back that was by far the most well constructed plywood boat I've ever seen. It was built using fir plywood and was only about 4 years old. The builder had built several boats previously. The outside was fiberglassed, the inside only epoxy coated. There was already some splitting of the fiberglass on the edges of the cockpit coaming and the beginnings of checking on the interior plywood. If I put the kind of effort into a boat that the builder of this Searunner had I would be disappointed if it started to look rough so quickly.
Thanks for letting me pick your brain.
Mike
