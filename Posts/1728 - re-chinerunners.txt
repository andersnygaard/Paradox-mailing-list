The problem I had with them was that I tried to lay them up with a number of full length pre-shaped strakes. They proved to be almost impossible to bend to shape, and hold while the glue went off. I eventually resorted to cutting them into a number of shorter lengths and gluing as a 3 dimensional jigsaw. When the epoxy had set I ground them to the templates with a sanding disc on the angle grinder.

Hello Paradox fans, 

I have a question, 

A major part of the paradox design is the chinerunners, what is so difficult about them, as I see them, as no real big deal to apply, form , whatever. the plans show them as very simple. would anybody care to elaborate??

this is a question about the DEFAULT materials.... 

Jack

if this has been gone over and beaten to death point me in the right direction.

I have plans in hand :)

Hoping for calm nights
