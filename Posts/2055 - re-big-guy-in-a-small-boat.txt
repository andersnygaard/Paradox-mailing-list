I would be reluctant to tow a drogue from the rear, as there is a hole in the transom where the tiller comes through. I have noticed that, when landing on a beach, even small waves slapping against the transom cause water to come in. This is not a problem on the beach as the volume is measured in cupfuls at most, but if it went on for 12 hours or so it would probably add up to quite a lot of water.

So the ideal solution would be to enjoy the removable rear window enhancement, combined to a properly dimensioned interior for heavy weather sailing; Bearing in mind that if you intend to use a waps, series sea drogue or such from the stern if caught up in a gale, you should first test your rear window against hydro-pistoning by spraying it with a 15 foot/second waterjet, just to assure yourself that it will be watertight in a breaking wave strike while laying under the series sea drogue.
