Hi Pete, 
thanks for the Info ! Good to know that a 2.5 is enough! 
Going down the river sure no problem ( same on the Yukon ), but what is about going up the River like the river Rhine in Germany =85

That's where I see the problem with a small outboard...
I agree, there must be a vented locker for the gas!
Trimming should not be a problem with all my gear....
I am myself are not a big fan of any motor, but there are no really alternatives on long travel when you are inland!
Regards from Germany Chris
