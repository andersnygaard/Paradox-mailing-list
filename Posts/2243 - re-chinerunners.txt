I am not sure what you mean by upword convexity. I only remembered the book after thinking my previous post through. If the chine is radiused on the bottom so as not no dig in sideways when beaching by acting as a sled, it must do the same in the water when surfing sideways, so as not to trip.

Can you form the chine runners out of hardwood and glue them on afterwards?

Well, I'm glad you got back in one piece. Didn't realize the security is that tight over there.
