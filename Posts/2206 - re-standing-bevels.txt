Thanks Paul for such a prompt and useful reply.
I've read the set of questions and answers and it is getting clearer. I've printed it all off because I find it easier to understand if I can mark the paper in colour pens so I'll go through it properly this evening.
I've made the jig for the deck beams so I'll start cutting the 6mm ply into 25mm strips as soon as the rain stops.
How is your Paradox coming along? Have you named her yet?
Thanks again and best wishes........Derek
