Subject: Paradox outboard bracket

Hi all, 

Just a note to say that I have included some pictures of my removable, side-mounted, outboard bracket on my website at http://www.little.jim.freeuk.com. 

Mounting the motor in this position means it should not get tangled in the sheet so can be used for motor sailing, though the angle of heel should not be such as to submerge the head of the outboard. 

Please note that this is a new web address; the old one was swamped with spam, so please update any bookmarks or links you may have.

Hoping for calm nights,

Al 
Yeovil, England.
