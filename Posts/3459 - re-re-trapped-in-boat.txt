Subject: Re: RE TRAPPED IN BOAT

Paradox is self righting without any human action (theoretically from 160 degrees). I have had a 90 degree knock-down (seamanship error) and the boat had recovered itself before I had really registered what had happened. In this respect it is much more a yacht than a dinghy.
