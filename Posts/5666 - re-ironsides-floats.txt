Hi Jeff &amp;al

How about a Hobie Mirage system? It should be simple to make a well near the 2nd bulkhead for a unit which could be pedalled from the seat and would be far more efficient than a stern hung prop. Look at this link for more information:

If a small rebate is made in the hull bottom the unit could be left in place permanently without creating too much drag and it would protect the unit from grounding.

They said, get a life. I looked on TradeMe but I couldn't find one.

I suspect we have the same weather. It rains frequently here, but not 
in great amounts. I have sometimes, because of the weather, wondered 
if there was a way to propel the boat from inside the cabin. Using 
the legs for power since they are big. A big slow turning propeller 
hung from the transome,(like an outboard motor). But how to link them 
together? Ropes? Hydraulics(with water)? Anything which is not 
greasy/oily. And somthing which can be removed and put away when not 
wanted. It is a hobby of mine to think this way. I have not done well 
on this challenge so far. Noli is interesting name. How did it named 
this?
