Hi Dave

when we met, before he left England, he said that he intended to sail on to Florida with Nancy. 
Most folk sailing that route stop at the Canaries  and possibly the Cape Verdes too, for rest and relaxation.

I hear that he has some damage to repair before sailing onwards, so no idea of when he'll depart.

Best
 Jim
