I built mine to plans and had to go through the learning curve with it but now it seems the most natural thing in the world to just grab it and use it without another thought. In a calm I can do 2Kts in a pace I can keep up for a very long time. Keep in mind that Paradox weighs quite a bit and once you get her moving it doesn't take a lot of energy to keep her going. I am very glad that I armored the end as I use it to push off of stuff and pole along if the sea bottom is hard enough. Once you learn to lower the grip end when pausing for a break it no longer jumps off the ball. Also, during one long calm I became annoyed at the squeaking noise it made so I put a little butter on the ball (all I had handy at the time) and haven't heard a peep out of it since.
