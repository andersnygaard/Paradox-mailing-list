Subject: FW: Re: Epoxy & Fibreglass - Retry

The 3M 77 doesn't affect the Epoxy bond as far as I know. Only a light mist of the stuff is used anyway to tack on the fabric, and everything seems to wet out just fine. I got the idea of using the adhesive spray in boat building after attending a seminar on building composite (foam/kevlar/carbon) model airplanes. Since then, I have seen other professional builders used this method and watched videos of this technique, which seems to be pretty standard practice in that industry. I'm not sure if I would tack on the cloth for a whole boat, but for tricky areas it's a lifesaver. I even used this method to cover the hatch, which allowed me to glass the thing in one step. Here is a picture of the hatch before applying the epoxy. http://www.microcruising.com/Graphics/st200052r.jpg. 

In regards to the cost of kevlar, I used up to 2 layers of the 1.7 oz kevlar on the leading edges of the rudder, centerboard and blade. The seconds I get from http://johnrsweet.com/Kevlar.html cost $1 a square foot, which means that it costs about $2 total to do each part. On the other hand, the bottom will be more expensive to do since it will need 5 yards of 5 oz kevlar, which runs $15 a yard for a 60" wide piece. The 10 oz fiberglass to cover the kevlar costs $7.80 a yard. If you wanted to substitute some 4 oz Dynel or 4 oz Xynole for the kevlar, then these fabrics cost less at $6.75 per yard for a 68" or 69" width piece respectively (http://www.raka.com/FiberglassCloth.html). I guess this would save you approximately $40 over the kevlar.

Of course, you'll need to buy plenty of epoxy. The three layers of woven roving will suck up a lot of the stuff; but as I stated before, this regimen will provide the most durable bottom. I think David Beard said it took several GALLONS to do the bottom of his PARADOX. Right now I believe one of the least expensive quality epoxies out there is the Raka 127 resin with their standard fast/slow hardeners. A 3-gallon kit runs $129, but I would get the 6-gallon kit at $239 if I was going to do a woven roving bottom. Of course, make sure that you get a sample kit first like I did to make sure that you like the product. I haven't gotten to try mine out yet, but I plan to glass SWAMP THING'S blade with it. I'll tell you how it turns out. I've also heard people say they like the Maas epoxy because it is thin. At the present time, I am using West System epoxy because I'm familiar with it and it cures quickly and it is fairly rigid. However, the 5:1 hardener is more liver toxic than the 2:1 epoxy hardeners like the ones used by System Three and Raka.

Lastly, why even cover the boat in epoxy and fiberglass? It sure seems like a lot of work and expense. Well, it is. I figure that when I'm done I will have spent about $400 per boat to complete the task. What I hope to achieve by glassing both SWAMP THING and LITTLE CRUISER is to increase their overall durability and to reduce their yearly maintenance. Since both boats were originally just painted, they were more prone to damage from groundings and from water damage (rot), and they showed evidence of this abuse all over their hulls. SWAMP THING even sank at the dock when her 1/2" thick bottom was pierced by a sharp rock at low tide. In addition, the fir plywood checked a great deal on both boats. This required that I spend a fair amount of time each year filling in the cracks aboard LITTLE CRUISER. SWAMP THING did not receive the same meticulous care; and after 19 years, her decks were in rough shape. There was a fair bit of rot in the deck and the stern suffered extensive damage. Here are some photos of the damage.

This is what happened to LITTLE CRUISER when she hit a reef: http://www.microcruising.com/Graphics/st20035r2.jpg

Hopefully, after both boats are sealed in epoxy and glass, these types of problems will be reduced. Here are a few pictures after a little work was done to SWAMP THING.
