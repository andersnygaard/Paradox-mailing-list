I think it would be handy to have a topping lift if one is in port wanting to install a sunshade over the open hatch on a hot day, or sit out on the aft deck. Maybe that idea won't work with Paradox though?

I have an umbrella which clips onto the hatch. Good for sun or rain (though I don't get much opportunity to use it in the sun!)

Hoping for calm nights
