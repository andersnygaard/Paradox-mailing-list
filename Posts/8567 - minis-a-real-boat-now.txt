Subject: Mini's a real boat now!

Finally, the bottom is on Mini. Thought I would be clever and suspend the bottom above the hull using two G clamps and a couple of tie downs. Wetted out the bottom with epoxy minus the hardener (a messy job with the bottom upside down) and then applied thickened epoxy with hardener to the hull. So far so good, but when I came to lower the bow, the tie-down released suddenly and the bottom rocketed towards the front of my shed with me desperately holding on to the front of it!  Crash, bang, smash, tools falling off shelves... LoL

Well, everything survived, including me, and from then on things proceeded relatively smoothly.

Don't know about others building experiences, but for me getting the bottom on is a watershed moment.  From here on the remainder of the build is fitting out, fibre-glassing, painting and getting her onto a trailer, rather than actual construction.

Cheers,

Rob.
