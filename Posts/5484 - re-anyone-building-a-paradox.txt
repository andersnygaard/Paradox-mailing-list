Pete, I spent a lot of time looking through your build site and really enjoyed all the pics. It's great to see you have gotten so much of it completed. I need to visit your area someday to make the bike trip to the pub, that must have been great everyone riding back home with a buzz and feeling good. 

Let me know when you arrive and I'll show you some great cycling countryside and plenty of nice pubs! We're all off next weekend to another beer festival. This will be a round trip of about 50 miles so it should be fun, weather permitting.

Pete, do you have any long distance trips in mind for this boat when you're done? It's great to read the stories of others who are able to take their little boats on long trips. I hope to be reading about your adventures soon.

I have lots of dreams, how they will pan out in reality is hard to say.

For a start, I have always had a desire to sail to the Isles of Scilly as Bill and Al did earlier this year. (see Bill's Blog http://bills-log.blogspot.com/ for his full story)

As I get closer to retirement :-) I have plans to go much further afield (wife permitting!). Being from Ireland originally, I would like to revisit some of my early cruising grounds. I'd want to cross the Irish sea, probably from Scotland, and firstly visit my birthplace of Carrickfergus http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrickfergus and show off the boat to family and friends. I'm also keen to visit Strangford Lough http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strangford_Lough which is an idyllic cruising area.

Further afield I plan to sail around the Clyde and Inner Hebrides. This is one (in my opinion) of the best cruising areas in the world. For a taster watch the video here. http://www.yachtingtv.co.uk/cmc.html
 
Who knows where I'll go next? The suggestion of a get-together in the Bahamas sounds great, it's just the getting there that may pose a problem :-)

Bill, have you seen Noli that Jeff is building http://ph.groups.yahoo.com/group/paradoxbuilders/photos/browse/988e and the stretched Enigma being built by George? http://e460.blogspot.com/

Cheers,
Pete
