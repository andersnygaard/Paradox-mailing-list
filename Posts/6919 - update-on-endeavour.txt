Subject: Update on ENDEAVOUR

Hello Paradoxians,

Just an update on my Paradox, ENDEAVOUR. At my last post, I had finished all the bulkheads and was about to begin some epoxy coating to start the waterproofing process. As it stands right now, all bulkheads and exposed deck beams are epoxied, sanded, faried, and painted. All turned out extremely well.

I have to spend the next week or so out of town so I doubt much will get done till mid to late August, but I hope to have a working 3-D hull by Sept. 01. My apologies for still not having any pics as I have spent every available $ for ply, lumber, epoxy, and the like....but rest assured, they will come.

Safe Passages To All,
Greg
