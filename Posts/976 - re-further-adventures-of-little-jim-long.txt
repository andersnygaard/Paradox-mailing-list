Thanks Al!!! It's so good to read of your continuing adventures aboard Little Jim. How do you feel about Little Jim's stability now? 

I have developed a lot of confidence in the boat. The wind was only about F4 but I was close hauled, and at the worst time (going through the tide race) was heeling at about 20 degrees. Occasional gusts, or waves, would push it a bit further, but it never felt twitchy, and it never occured to me that we were in any danger of going over. It all felt quite solid. While I would not intentionally go into water that rough unless there was good reason I have no worries that it would be safe. One thing of note was that although green water was washing right over the boat we were not stopped, and kept on powering through the waves.

What is a "chain ferry"? 

It pulls itself across the harbour entrance along a chain. It is constrained by the chain so can make little effort to avoid other boats. It usually starts to cross just when you have committed to going through in front of it (or that is what it feels like)

I can only assume that you had enough coffee. I hope I am correct in recalling that Glen uses a chamois aboard Zoe for defogging. I like David's solution of optical cleaner. 

Hoping for calm nights
