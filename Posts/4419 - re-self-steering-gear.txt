Running is the problem, because the effect of the wind on a vane is 
lessened, but all the modern gears work in this respect.  My first 
windvane system back in 1974 was a Halser SP90, and this worked 
pretty well when running, just with a slight meandering.  There is a 
similar Hasler Windvane system for sale at

under the number  140116173885.  Just copy this number and paste it 
into the 'search box'.
