(Sorry for the delay, I was off on a week long canoe trip...)


Added cabin plywood with cutouts for windows.  7 inch openings on the sides, 9 1/2 inches in front.  The top supports are 1 inch square, as are the supports into which the bottom of the windows will be screwed. There is also a 1/2 inch square batten all around where the deck meets the cabin.


Note that at the rear half of the cabin top, three battens 1 1/4 by 1 inch were glued on.  This will block and support the 1 inch tall folding hatch which will be added later. These extra 2 inches will raise the rear of the cabin where my head will be to 35 inches tall (18 boat + 15 cabin + 2 hatch).


At the rear, there is a 4 inch by 30  inch screened window which is always open to give the needed ventilation when riding the boat with the hatch closed.  A piece of plank 2 inches wide is inserted at a 45 degree angle to prevent water from coming in.  Because the hatch will extend an inch over the rear of the cabin, this is sufficient to prevent rain from entering, so no means of closure is necessary.


I waterproofed the boat by painting sides and deck with epoxy and then lightly sanding prior to painting with polyurethane paint.  On all edges above water, I added 4 inch wide fibreglass tape.  At the bottom, I added two 3/8 inch by 2 inch plywood «runners» and had the entire bottom and 4 corners professionally sprayed with linex bedliner. This gives me a bombproof bottom which I can drag on rocks or cement ramps without the slightest thought.  Of course this is at the expense of 4 or 5% in speed and an added weight of about 30 or 40 lbs, but it was worth it to me, because of the way I wanted to bang it around.


4 new pictures at the end of the Gorfnik album.
