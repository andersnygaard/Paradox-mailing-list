You are right Alan.
I did not get the bottom out of one sheet. I fact it was from one and a third.
I got the drawings mixed up in my head.
It's my age you know.
The drawing I was thinking of was for my look alike ENIGMA which I dew up with a 36" beam to take my larger size.
Matt is a lot smaller than me so I also added an extra 1/2" to her draught and an 1" to her freeboard thus allowing me to draw in a flat cabin sole.This brings her displacement up to about 700 lbs, although her empty weight is about the same.
If Dave or Mindy is reading this, is the cooking arrangement basically the same as in ENIGMA?

Sorry for the confusion Alan
