I'm now working between bulkheads 2 an 3 and I'm thinking about the water tanks.

I had intended to leave them out and use a couple of 10 litre bladders with taps but decided to investigate the possibilities of including them. I know that West Systems and UK epoxies aren't suitable so I gave SP a call and asked if I could use their epoxy to seal potable water tanks. The reply from the tech guy was, "For Christ's sake don't do that; at the least you'll be very sick and at the worst you'll go blind." 

The only safe way to do a water tank is to use a potable coating over the sealant. Blakes do a potable coating but it only comes in 9 litre cans and is very expensive.

Back to the bladders I think.
