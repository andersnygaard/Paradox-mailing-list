Hello Paradoxians,

I have registered to participate in the Texas 200 event scheduled for June 2020. Wanted to share this information with the hope that others may sail their paradox in the event.

Sean Milligan and Mike Beebe have sailed in the event be past, who else will be part of this? Come on, let's get more exposure for our boats and do a meet up as well.

Information is at www.Texas200.com ( http://www.Texas200.com )

Hope to see you there,

Deric
