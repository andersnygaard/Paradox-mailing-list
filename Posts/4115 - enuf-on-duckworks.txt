Hi all,

Derek Clark has written a follow-up article to his Paradox building offering. This one details the pleasure and pain of owning a self-built boat and the eventual disaster that befell him. It's well-written too.

See <http://www.duckworksmagazine.com/07/outings/paradox/index.htm>

Hoping for calm nights.

Al,
Yeovil, England.
