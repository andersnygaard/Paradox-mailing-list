Hi all,

Does anyone know if the exact shape of the outer edge of the chine runners has a significant hydrodynamic function? I am referring to the upward curve of the bottom. Since I am using sheet metal for the bottom, this curve is hard to accomplish. (I.e., if I can't accomplish it, then we'll later on have the answer on this question)
