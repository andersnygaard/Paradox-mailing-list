Are you saying that if you are sailing with the halyard slack with the boom on the deck or the cabin you find it awkward to tack or gybe?  I must agree.

He put the Y in it so that the boom could still move forward and aft, while sailing, but restrict the side to side (wrist) movement at the Y. That makes to boom stand up on the tube and reach all the way to the side of the boat when it lays down. That improves its function but is not absolutely necessary. johninbastrop 

But it is necessary. With the original set-up, when sailing reefed, with the strut under compression, the joint will collapse sideways and the boom drops down onto the cabin top or, if running, down onto the deck. This makes it awkward to tack or gybe (and can give you a headache)
