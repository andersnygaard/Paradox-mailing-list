I know this is a bit off subject perhaps
Make sure to keep away from the fumes when your melting lead , it's real bad for your body

I ate a lot of Garlic ,when doing that job ,  the sulphur in the garlic , partly responsible for the odour it creates , bonds with lead in your system and helps remove it .

I have no weight in compartment two and have trouble tacking in anything but smooth seas , will remedy that as soon as my battery is fitted

Keep building
