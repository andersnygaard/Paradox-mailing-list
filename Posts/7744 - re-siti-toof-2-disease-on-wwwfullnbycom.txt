My first season I decided not to have a motor because then I would 
*have* to learn to sail. 

It must have worked as I didn't bother with a motor the second year, 
or the third. Eventually I got the electric motor but, except for 
when travelling up river, I have only used it two or perhaps 3 times. 
It really isn't essential for the sort of boating I do.

Have a good time in the sun.
