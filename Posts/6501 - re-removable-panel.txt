I have no experience building Paradox (I plan to build the Enigma 460) and I have considered doing the same rear opening on Enigma. 

From a structural point of view, the original design is a box shape, which gives tremendous strength to the roof and cabin. If you cut away the rear part of the window and roof, you will reduce the structural integrity of the cabin. You would then have to reinforce the 2 rear corners of the cabin, on either side of the opening. Maybe there are some photographs of the rear hatch of Little Cruiser that you can study for ideas on how to do this.
