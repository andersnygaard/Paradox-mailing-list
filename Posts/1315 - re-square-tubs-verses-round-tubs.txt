So now we have had advice from Don which apparently isn't his personal opinion (?) and advice from Glen (with supporting reasoning) which presumably is his personal opinion. Now we can all develop our own personal opinions and this needn't develop into another of Don's confrontations.

"I tried the vinegar but personally didn't like it." 
Glen "What you personally don't like and what works are two different things. What the homebuilder needs is less of your kind of stuff, and something he can use, practically, without exposing himself to dangerous chemicals. Is this my personal opinion, no, it my advice to boatbuilders. Don

Note:
Never, ever, use vinegar to clean your skin, and wear gloves when using it. Work CLEAN. If you take precautions epoxy should not get on your skin in the first place, if it does follow the epoxy manufactures advice for removing it. Work sensibly and you should never have a problem of any kind. 

Some would like to make much more out of it than need be. Don
