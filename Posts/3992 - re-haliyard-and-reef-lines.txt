Al,

I'm doing the same, but I still hope to have an easy system for dispensing water - probably from the starboard side locker forward of bulkhead 2. I'll expect I'll have a plastic water contain fitted in the side storage bin.

That's quite a good idea, that space isn't much use for anything else. You might need to watch the trim and have something heavy to move up there as you use the water, with it being so far forward.

Hoping for calm nights

Yeovil, England.
