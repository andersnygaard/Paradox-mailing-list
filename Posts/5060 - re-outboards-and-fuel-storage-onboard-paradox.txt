CD's and DVD's are obsolete Ray. Go with flash memory such as the iPod or SD card players. No moving parts and you can store lots of music, video and games on a tiny device that you can wear around your neck, or maybe included in your cell phone, which you can also use to take photos or send messages as well.

Or better yet, carry a harmonica;-)

I carry a harmonica, but the picture is terrible (and the sound isn't much better).
