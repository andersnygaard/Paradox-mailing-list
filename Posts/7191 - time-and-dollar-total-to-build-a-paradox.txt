Subject: Time and dollar total to build a Paradox?

Hello all,

I am considering building one of these remarkable little sailboats and want a very clear idea in advance of what I'm up against.

If you have built a Paradox, please tell me how many hours it took in total, and also give me some sense of your level of experience with such things. :-)

And, what was the total dollar cost in materials? Especially if you are in Australia and have built in the last few years.

Many thanks in advance.
(I promise to pay it forward by making and sharing thorough records if I do go ahead and build one.)
