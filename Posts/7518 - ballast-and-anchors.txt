It's time for me to start collecting more pieces for the boat, I start way early so I can maybe get a great deal on Craigslist, eBay or Amazon. 

What types and sizes of anchors are people using and happy with?

Also, how much dead weight are people adding for ballast? 

Can't say I'm excited about working with, purchasing or adding a couple hundred kilos of lead. I'd much rather use water but I'm thinking there might not be enough room for that. 

Thanks in advance, 

Dave
