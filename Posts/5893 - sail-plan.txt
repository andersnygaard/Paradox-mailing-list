I am seriously considering building the 20% larger Paradox.

According to the Larger Paradox file this would entail a sail 60% larger, or 160 sq ft.

A sail this size in the current configuration would seem to be pretty cumbersome....although I may be wrong about this.

Would it be blasphemy to consider an alternate sail plan....such as a cat yawl or similar? (like a bolger micro)

It seems like it would be a more efficient rig...although it would have complications such locations of spars, size of sails, how to operate from below, etc.

Hope I am not too far off asking this question....and wonder if anyone else has considered altering the sail plan?
