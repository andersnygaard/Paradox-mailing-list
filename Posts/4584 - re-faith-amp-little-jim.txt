I don't get this problem, but if the aft end of the toppiing lift gets caught in the sail while it is being rolled it can get snarled up. I just need to make sure the topping lift is not slack while the sail is being rolled.

When the sail is first being hoisted I have to ensure the yard does not get caught on the wrong side of the topping lift. I think the benefits of having a topping lift outweigh the disadvantages.
