Hello DC

Thanks for the pep talk. You're absolutely right about sailing sooner rather than later. That's why I'm signing up for an entry level sailing course in Winnipeg, Manitoba. I don't know about your area, but around here we still have a bit of ice on most of the lakes. It will be at least another 3-4 weeks before any serious boating starts. What part of the northwest are you in?

Cheers,
Alf
