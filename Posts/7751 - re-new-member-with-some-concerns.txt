Thanks, that explains a lot. From the pictures I'd seen, I thought the gooseneck was rigid in the side axis, and I couldn't understand how the deck fitting could stand up to that long moment arm without ripping the screws right out of the deck. I guess that line leading upward from the forward end of the roller fitting was part of a topping lift? If so, is it normally under some tension to relieve some of the strain on the sail

OK. There is no deck fitting and no screws.
I think a picture or two is needed to explain. I'll see what I can rustle up.

Yes the line at the forward end is a topping lift.
It should be under zero tension and plays no part in the setting of the sail. The sail is hoisted and then the furling line is used as a downhaul to tighten the luff as much as possible. A tight luff is really important on a lug sail for efficiency. The topping lift isn't part of the design, it's been added by a lot of builders to aid with the handling of the boom and furling, but it comes at a price! Matt does not use one on the original Paradox and in a private email to me he encouraged me not to use one either!
