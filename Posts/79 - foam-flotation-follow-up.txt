This post is about installing foam flotation material inside Paradox. 

Notice: To all members who intend to build a Paradox it is perfectly 
safe to install foam insulation over the epoxy-coated interior of fir 
plywood. 

Today I called two epoxy manufactures, System Three and West system, 
both reassured me that rot will not occur and they see no problem at 
all with doing this. 

Lois of System said that as long as the fir plywood is not wet before 
coating it will not check nor will it rot, ever. He said it should in 
fact protect the surface further. 

Jim Watson of West epoxy said also that there is no problem at all 
with bonding insulation to epoxied fir plywood; as a matter of fact 
they build iceboxes on boats all the time using this procedure. He in 
fact has done this on his own boat. 

I never post something without being absolutely sure about the truth 
behind my statement, particular when it comes to boat building.  

Soon I will prepare an article to show how foam should be installed, 
also I will explain how important it is to have this foam flotation 
in place aboard Paradox and why it is not a good idea to leave the 
flotation material out.
