Thanks, André-François.

So I understand you to say that Paradox can carry about 200 lbs of stores. I'm guessing that the total weight of 1600 lbs does not include your own weight? From some of the photos on the microcruising website it appears that sometimes two people sailed/cruised aboard Paradox. I'm guessing that with two people there is little excess capacity for stores?

What I'm really trying to figure out is whether a Paradox can be considered a two-person cruising boat, or if it really is a one-person boat? I understand that the Bolduc's cruised together on Little Cruiser for months at a time, but LC is 16 ft long and presumably can carry 50%+ more stores than can Paradox?



Hi A.S.,

I believe 1410 is the weight of the finished Paradox including water and lead ballast. When in cruising mode, if you are carrying cans of food, for example, you can then reduce the lead ballast by the equivalent weight. Until you eat them of course, so I don’t count them. Which means when cruising long distance, my boat usually weighs in at 1600 lbs or so.

Sailing season just around the corner here in Québec Canada! Still ice on the lakes…
