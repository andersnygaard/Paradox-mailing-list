Subject: Building Questions

Hi, 
I've just started building a paradox and have a few questions.

1. The plans show the side panel scarf as 110mm, but according to general design rules, the scarf should be 12:1 (so about 144mm scarph). Should I extend the scarf and lengthen the rear side panels to compensate?

2. Does the vent trunk drain go all the way through the hull to the outside? It seems to show this on the plans.

3. Can the lightening ground on the bottom be covered in fiberglass or should it be in electrical contact with the water?

Thanks,
