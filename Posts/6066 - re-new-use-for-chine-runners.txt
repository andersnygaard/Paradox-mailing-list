I was a little boy the first time I saw it. we went to the beach in Santa Monica, Calif. The waves breaking showed it off nicley. At a later time I was with my dad in a 16 ft runabout doing maybe 25 knots and the bow splash glowed. And standing up and looking over the windshield we saw streaks of light under the water of fish trying dart away to the side of our course. A wonder.

Sounds like you had a great time Steve.
I remember the first time I experienced luminesense (1979 I think).
We were delivering a Ron Holland 40 footer back to her home port in Ireland after racing in Cowes week. There were 4 of us onboard and we left The IOW at 2200 to catch the tide down the Solent. We were working 4 hour watches and I was first down. Needless to say I didn't sleep much and so when I was shaken at 0200 I was dog tired. My watch mate decided that he was going suffer from sea sickness and spent most of the time sprawled in his bunk. Just before dawn I had a tremendous shock. I thought that we were being chased by hundreds of sea creatures. I called my mate who came on deck to see waht I was shouting about. The water was glowing with thousands of sparkling green snakes of green phosphorescent light. At one point we were enveloped in a green sea of light - really remarkable. I'll never forget the experience and have never seen such a vivid display since.

Now must get this Paradox finished...
