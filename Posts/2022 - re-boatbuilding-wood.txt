Hi again, Phil.

I personally wouldn't use alder or hemlock for boatbuilding. That said, Matt wrote several months ago that Paradox's scantlings are the size they are, to allow for lumberyard materials such as "hem-fir", which can sometimes look very enticing. If I remember correctly, Matt said that he's not found any rot yet aboard Paradox. Also, he used AC exterior plywood. I believe that Matt expressed a desire on his part to use replenishable resources. It is true that when a forest is replanted, it is most often replanted with marketable timber, the market being building construction. My sister, who used to be a logger, calls these trees, "super trees". They grow VERY fast. Fast growth results in similar weight, but much weaker structure.

Here in the Pac NW, Alaska Yellow Cedar can be a really nice species for joinery, though it is fairly soft. Douglas Fir is one of my favorite species, providing it is old growth. If you use Doug Fir, try to resist sanding too much. It's better in every respect to use edge tools as much as possible with Doug Fir, as the summer wood is so much softer than the winter wood. We also have some excellent quality species from Central and South America, as well as the Orient. You might give Edensaw Hardwoods a call. The owners have extensive personal experience with boat building, maintenence, and sailing. Did I mention they know wood?

Have fun.
