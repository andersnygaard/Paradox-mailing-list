Hi,

Thanks for that, I should have thought to ask you. Al and I did try with the topping lift set for different heights at the clew but had no success. Now that I've got a better boom I'll try again to get it right. I guess everything takes a little longer to set up than one expects.

Cheers  ...  Derek
