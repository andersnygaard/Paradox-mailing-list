Subject: A day's work

Being as how the group is quiet I'll give you a review of today's Enuffery.

Had a cracking day.
Now that the weather has improved I decided it was time to make a trolley to move the 
boat back and forwards from the workshop to the drive.
Firstly, I recycled some wheels that I had on an old, narrow trolley. Went to unbolt them 
and found that they had been welded in place. An hour with the angle grinder sorted that. 
I assembled them on a wooden frame that I had prepared earlier and slid the boat out of 
the workshop on wooden blocks with the help of my wife and son.
Using two by two levers, blocks of wood, trolley jacks and axle stands we raised the boat 
and put the trolley underneath. Lowered the boat, removed jacks etc., tidied the drive and 
pushed Enuf backwards and forwards. Lovely.
Number one son helped me to push Enuf back into the workshop and as the front trolley 
wheels hit the half inch lip of the workshop floor they stopped dead, ripped out of the 
wood and Enuf skidded into its original resting place but without the 6 by 4's under it!
There was a heated exchange (obviously number one son's fault!) and now he and wife are 
only talking to each other.
No doubt it will all seem funny one day in the distant future.
