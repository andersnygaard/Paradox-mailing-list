Subject: Re: roller reefing lug sail?

Glen-

Thanks for your response. Since i received dead silence from the group i have since procured a set of paradox plans. However, i already build my yard and boom so i'm going to traditionally rig it so i can get out on the water this fall. Over the winter i plan on building a new beefyer tapered boom with the drum and thimble reefing system. I rolled my sail up on my spars and it seems like the shape of my lug (200 sqft. off a Bolger martha Jane) will lend itself to relatively neat reefing and storage. Matt really outdid himself on this conntraption, very well thought out......like the rest of the boat. Goes to show what a few thousand miles of boating will bring to mind.

Thanks again,
Jason

p.s.
I did all the math the boat sould have a trace of weatherhelm and any miscalulations should be fixable by increasing/decreasing the rudder length.......hope i got it right the first time around.
