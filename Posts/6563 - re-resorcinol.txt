Last week I messed about a little more, gluing scarph joints for 1/2" plywood panels.

I like the resorcinol, and the 3/4" plywood panel scarph joint appears to be strong; so I won't be performing a boil or strength test, as previously noted.

More details can be found on my blog http://okieboat.blogspot.com/

Also I added the blog to the Links for this group, incase the address gets filtered out of this post.

Respectfully,
