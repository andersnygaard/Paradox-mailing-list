DC,

Thanks for taking time to put together the beam contruction info.  I'm slowly working on my beams now, so I read your intructions carefully. My experience with laminating is limited to coamings I made for the cockpit and hatches of a sea kayak four years ago. One thing I noticed in your instructions that seems counter-intuitive (to me) is the statement that there is less springback when laminating with thicker material.  

The laminates (Douglass Fir) I'm planning to use for the beams are 3mm thick and I'm experimenting with different methods of prebending, because subjectively it seems like there is going to be a lot springback without prebending. But if I understand you correctly, I would have a greater amount of springback with thinner laminates. I'd like to make sure I'm not misunderstanding you, since I was considering using thinner laminates with the expectation there would be less springback.

Thanks again for writing up the instructions.

Steve
