Yes,

To be positivly boyant is to float on top of the water, negative sinks, nueteral is like you said deck level with the surface but not sinking. USCG approved 2 part mixable pour in or sprayed foam has a specific boyancy per amount used, I cannot remmember offhand the numbers but thats how it works. different materials have different boyancy "ratings"
