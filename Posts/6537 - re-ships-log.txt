INDEED I got there right away by clicking your link!=C2=A0 Slowness is common unless someone has higher speed.

Glad for your idea too.=C2=A0 Blogger is easy.. just type a message whenever and it allows you to stick a picture.=C2=A0 Looking forward to seeing the account of your Paradox building process.

Regards,

Andrew

I started a blog to post the diary of my build for the Paradox.  First off I know very little about building boats.  Secondly, I know less about blogs, or even what a blog is.

I do know I have found the information posted by this group, and the sites established by Paradox builders, to be most helpful.  I doubt, I would have taken this path without the bread crums left behind by others.  Again thanks for leading the way, and sharing your journeys.

So I wanted to return the favor of previous builders, add to the map for future builders (more likely what not to do), and also document the project for myself.

The link is http://okieboat.blogspot.com/ 

I just set it up.  It only has one post.  I even have my doubts as to whether the settings allow the public to view it.  It takes me forever to get into it, even from my new gmail account.  If someone does try, and is not allowed to view it; please let me know, so I can play with the settings.

I am not familiar with google.  I've been a big yahoo fan for years, but I didn't find a yahoo equivalent of this, so I chose google assuming they will be around for a while (longer than GeoCities, which I found interesting).  Had I found a decent yahoo equivalent, I would have used it.  Yahoo seems to link accounts and navigate very well.

Well it is out there.  It will get updated about as slowly as my boat gets built.  For me, it is all fun as long as there are no time frames.  That's probably why I like sailing.
