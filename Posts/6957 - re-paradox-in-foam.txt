I investigated the use of foam with a boat yard. Very interesting stuff and very strong. I had the same concerns over how light foam seemed and they told me that it could be made to any weight I required.

This boat was built in foam..Lots of it.. http://intheboatshed.net/2008/02/29/sven-yrvind-collaborates-with-matt-layden/
Chine runners are not a stand alone device like a centerboard or leeboard. It is basically an extension of the chine... The runner will work as well at any depth....but the chine is part of the boat....and IT needs to be relatively deep with the necessary lifting body hull. JIB A boat is a sum of the parts...that is the genius of Matt's designs.

The design of the paradox in plywood is part of the need to get great weight into the finished design. The chine runners need to be well submerged to do their work. If the boat were built of light weight foam the overall "gestalt" of the design is upset. Also you would become a designer yourself and not be tied to this "exact" design. I may be awkward for anyone to give handy advice too.

G'day I am new to this group but look forward to building the paradox.
I know the plans call for it to be built in plywood but Iam wondering if anyone has tried to build it in foam.
If this has not been done yet what needs to change when converting plywood plans to foam construction or is it just the materials that change?
Any feedback would be appreciated.
Thanks.
