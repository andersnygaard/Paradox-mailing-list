Subject: Basis for a Microcruiser

Hi to all Stateside.

I saw this on eBay just now and thought it would make the basis for a good microcruiser.

We can only wonder over here in the UK at the cheap prices in the States and why no one seems there wanting to buy.

Perhaps there's no money in the States.

There's no money over here but we still seem to pay over twice as much for the same boat as can be bought Stateside.

If anyone see's a Freedom 35 cat ketch C/B version ready to go for about $5,000 give me a shout.
