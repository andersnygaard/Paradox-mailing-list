I like the brolly bracket idea Al. Do you wear a bowler hat too for when the wind is too strong for the brolly? ...:-)

I noticed on Saturday how secure your boat is with padlock through the hatch slider. Would be reassuring if leaving the boat unattended by the towpath.

If you had a soft top Derek, don't you think you are more vulnerable to vandals?
