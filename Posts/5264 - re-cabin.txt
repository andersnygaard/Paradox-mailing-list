Subject: Re: Cabin

Al and Bill.  OK, I will take your advice and make something for that. 
My springback was only 1/4 inch at each end of the beams. Better than I 
expected. I'm finally using the special pieces of pretty wood I've been 
saving for something special. Some teak and mahogany and some I cannot 
identify except it's pretty and red. These will go where they are most 
visible around the hatch area. All those scary angles in the cabin 
framing are not so bad if you just take one little step at a time. I'm 
having fun. Steve
