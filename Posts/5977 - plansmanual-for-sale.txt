Hi guys. 

I haven't been able to get in touch with either Dave Bolduc or Don Elliott regarding buying the plans (it appears their websites are out of commission). Does anyone have an up-to-date information on whom to contact and how? 

Also, I was wondering if anyone on this forum has a set of plans/manual they would consider reselling. If so, please email me at michael_urbanski@yahoo.com.

All the best. 

Michael
