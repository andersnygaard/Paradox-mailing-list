Subject: Re: anchor locker

Hi Bill.

Absolutely correct, the boat must be trimmed to her lines. My problem is that I am a big guy, at 6"1", 225 lbs. I try to stay low and centered on small boats. I find that my going forward aboard small boats can so upset the balance, that I find the boat spinning around, instead of heading for the intended target. It must look rather silly, and it sure does throw a wrench in a well thought plan.

I shall try to avoid even climbing on deck, so aft stowage of the primary anchor and rode is preferred. I hope to be able to lead the rode up to a bow chock or roller (ala stern anchor roller), and aft to the anchor for dropping the hook on a whim. If I can't secure the rode aft, I will likely try to do so on a cleat directly fwd of the cabin. This, all in the effort to remain as inboard as possible. Other anchor(s) and rode(s) will be stowed below.

Have you considered the need for drainage of your rode solution? Would you just install a drain straight down through the bottom, as the fwd vent trunk? Perhaps incorporate the rode locker with an additional ventilation trunk? I have considered this, and worked out a way to allow for ventilation and drainage, without allowing too much water ingress in a roll. Alas, I need to stay off the bow as much as possible, so it is only a thought at this point.
