Hi Bill.

On "PARANIGMA" or from now on NOLI. I have started to install foam camping bedding mat's as insulation, held in place with a spray adhesive. The foam is about 3/8" thick and costs about =A33.oo a roll.
I expect to do the whole boat for about =A315.oo.

Hi Hugh.

Thanks for the insight on your PARADOX. Glad to hear you are hanging onto her.
Could you tell us about that 40 nm cruise?
Have you had much interest in her when you have been out sailing PETITE LADY?
