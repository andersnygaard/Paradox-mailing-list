Hello

It is very difficult to decide something.
Surely an experienced boat builder of boats already built several years sees such changes differently than I but if no one dares something there is always the same boat and just empty rhetoric brings nobody's business. I spent several months with the reading your postings, I thought it all out well and long. As a normal paradox could be a little larger (should), I would dare such a step. Only then I need help from the forum safe. New sail plan, some dimensions (engine, Yoluh, mast) and certainly the one or the other. I hope you will help me then if I have any questions, at the end I have to always decide whether or how it is done (so no other the blame for a mistake hits but only me) but I also need your ideas to help it then later another. It's not like I want to build a 24ft boat I want more, only 20% and the blasphemous achieved even with this new Struck Tour without bulkheads. We are talking about a few centimeters per room. My boat should be able to carry more load (diving equipment, generator, tools, anything to live on such a boat for some time can). I do not want a racing boat I will not be there, just where I want to take there here today and there tomorrow. That's why I'm so optimistic that this boat will float properly. What makes me worry for the time being, only the weight of the boat on the trailer because I do not know how many kilograms of the boat will have then.
