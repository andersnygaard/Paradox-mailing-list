Nels,
I'd actually considered making a Lexan board similar to Little Cruiser's. There some good photos and a write up here. http://www.microcruising.com/lcwindow.htm

Obviously with Paradox it's not really worth having a double wash board as the board is only 260mm tall to begin with.

The 3 positions are a neat idea but whether I could be bothered with it is questionable. I suppose it's no real effort to fabricate and it may be a nice addition at times.
