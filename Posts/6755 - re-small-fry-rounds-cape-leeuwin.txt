That's interesting. Sounds like this could be a feature of the lug rig rather than something peculiar to the paradox. I wonder if even more masts would create further improvement in windward performance ;)

hi all,

yes, my experience in an Oughtred Puffin (high peaked lug sail) is that it behaves better, sails more controllably, particularly to windward in strong winds - when the gaff / yard lies against the mast.  

because of more induced twist in the sail?

nb. - first post - dunno if this is the right way .....
