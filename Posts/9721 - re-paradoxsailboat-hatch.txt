Hello Paradoxians,

My paradox has the SS bolts and when I purchased the boat I did remove the rails in order to refinish them and paint them with two part poly. Moreover I used the Butyl tape, the good kind like that sold by Rod Collins AKA Maine Sail on the internet. No leaks.

In the picture one may note the bolts and the white paint. The black sunsreen is what I use when I sail sitting on the floor to allow fresh air and reduce the heat from the sun.

Fair winds,
Deric
