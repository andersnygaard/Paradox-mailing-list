Nice account of your trip in Little Jim. It brings back many fond memories of our last trip in Little Cruiser which we are still in the process of writing up. Incidently, Mindy and I always use foam pads/cushions to sit on during our cruises. These are made out of closed cell foam, similar to the type sold in back packing stores. You could also use one of the cushions that you use for sleeping on if it is small enough and covered in vinyl. This is what Matt has aboard Paradox.
