Dave, The things I do for you. The article on the Europe trip, a voyage from Waymouth on the south coast of England through the European waterways and the Black Sea to Istanbul, is in the September 2001 number 159 CLASSIC BOAT magazine. A review of the Golant Gaffer appeared in the July 1998 number 121 CLASSIC BOAT MAGAZINE as well.
See if you can find someone local who might have these articles, if not let me know via the forum.
I think I will go to bed now and read these articles, but not before I do one more e-mail.
