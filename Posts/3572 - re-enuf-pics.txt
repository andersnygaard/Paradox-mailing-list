Hi Al,

Not really decided yet whether to build or buy something secondhand which is ready-made.

I think that the Paradox might suit me well as I am not really keen to sit outside in a cockpit getting wet and cold. Just unsure of its sailing qualities, particularly its ability to make progress to windward in British conditions.

It's so unlike the *normal* sailing boats that we are used to seeing that there is a doubt in my mind. I ask myself why, that if such a simple boat works, there is a large market for conventional boats.

If I bought a boat secondhand, it would be unlikely to be one that could be sailed from inside because there aren't any of those about. So would have to get to like the open-air life... ;-(

Building a Paradox is a big commitment of time and money and there is an uncertain market for when I reach my dotage and want to sell it. Hence my hesitation.

But I might yet!
