Thanks, Al, but spending more than an hour at the ramp doesn't appeal. And since appropriate ballast low down is crucial to self-righting, I expected it wouldn't be that simple to adjust load capacity. A better way to phrase my question might be: what does a Paradox weigh, rigged and with all ballast aboard? More than just trailer weight, I want to know what it's capable of carrying--so I'll know both what is damanded of the trailer, AND how much more weight it takes to get to the dwl.

Who spends an hour at the ramp? Actually I often do, but only because someone wants to talk about my boat. Otherwise it takes about 20 mins if I am not in a rush.

I am not really understanding what you are asking. John Gilbert has given a good run-down in another post. If you have built the boat to the plans, when the boat is in the water and sailing it should weigh 1400 lbs. If you have little gear and no stores (and depending on the weight of the skipper) then about 400 lbs of this will be lead ballast. If, like me, you have many anchors, and habitually carry lots of tins of food and other junk then the amount of lead will be reduced by the weight of this stuff.

Having said that, it is not over sensitive to the final displacement. I have, on several occasions, sailed off without filling the water tanks (150 lbs) and not noticed for some time. I also once took on a passenger and noticed little change to the handling.

I have only checked the displacement a couple of times in the last 5 years. As long as it is sailing well I assume it is all right.

Hoping for calm nights
