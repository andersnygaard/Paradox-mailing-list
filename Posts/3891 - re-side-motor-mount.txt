Subject: Re: Side Motor Mount

This is exactly what I have done on Little Jim. I have fitted an electric motor as I didn't fancy being inside with a load of petrol.

Make sure the bracket is sturdy enough, the first one I made began to distort at full throttle. I eventually used brass hinges with a removable pin as the mounting, with a strut forward to keep it square to the hull.

You won't be able to leave it mounted while sailing as it would spend much of it's time under water.

Surprisingly, it doesn't need to be angled significantly to make the boat run straight, though it does turn to stbd quicker than port. I have my motor fixed and steer with the rudder as the prop would foul the chine if turned that way.

I will post some pictures later, but I am going away sailing for a week now so it will not be until after next weekend.

Hoping for calm nights
