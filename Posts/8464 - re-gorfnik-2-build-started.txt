Subject: Re: Gorfnik #2 build started

Thanks again Eerik,

It is too late for my sides. They are all cut and I just need to get my clamps and sander to finish shaping them.

I did use the circular saw to cut the transom on another boat. I was surprised how good it cut the radius on the top. That was much thicker plywood and the circular saw was much faster than a jigsaw plus I needed angled cuts on three of the sides. Like you said, hardly any sanding required. I'm sure it would work for the side pieces on Gorfnik since there is not a lot of curve to the bottom.

I'll add that tip as well as the router idea in the plans so others will have a choice of methods to cut the plywood.
