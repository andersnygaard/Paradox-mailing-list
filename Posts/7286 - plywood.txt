I am busy reading every single post from 2001 (at 1656) but will want to get my plywood before I get through them all. I would like group info on Aquatek and Hydotek compared to Okoume. Although Matt prescribes Doug Fir, I have decided to go sides and deck of better quality. Bottom will remain Doug Fir.

Thanks.
