Subject: New Book for Small Boat Fans
Date: Wed, 9 Jul 2003 21:33:04 -0400

Those of you who are fans of Matt's Paradox and Sven Lundin's Bris boats may be interested in my latest book which is about small boats that have crossed oceans. It's called A SPECK ON THE SEA and tells the stories of over 70 remarkable voyagers and their boats going as far back as Roman times. There aren't many books out there for people who like small boats because most of the books are about yachters or naval history. My book is about people who have done remarkable things in the kinds of boats that most people can afford. The book tells their stories, describes their equipment, and discusses their successes and mistakes.

I want to thank Dave and Mindy for some help along the way, including donating some photos. The book is published by McGraw-Hill and is 375 pages and includes 155 pictures. If you spend a lot of time dreaming about small boats then I think you'll like this book. You can order if from www.amazon.com, or if you want an autographed copy you can send me a check for $22.00 ($18 + $4 for Priority Mail) and I'll inscribe it to you personally.

Yours,
