Hi Nels, I can't get the link to work.

Bill.

It was a photo of Jubilee the 40' sharpie that is in the Hogfish Maximus folder in the files here.

http://groups.yahoo.com/group/paradoxbuilders/files/Hogfish%20Maximus/

The photo shows Jubilee on a travelift and the chine runners are clearly visible.

You have probably seen the photo before.

Thanks for sorting out the link. On the theme of dimensions, how come the chine runners on the Jubilee are so narrow? Maybe they need to be. I know nothing of the science determining size of chine runners, but if Jubilee is similar to a scaled up Paradox, shouldn't the chine runners be bigger?

Bill.
