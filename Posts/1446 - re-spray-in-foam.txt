Subject: Re: Spray In Foam

Hi Bill.

I've used the two-part foam, in pours, for icebox construction. It's a
little like the old moster movies. 

The commercially applied spray-in foam is really cool. I think that
the skill of the applicator has more to do with a good job, than does
the material, packaging, and equipment. This is the two-part
polyurethane stuff, not the softer one-part foam.

A good spray insulation job is one in which the foam is applied only
to the level which still allows expansion, but not above the level at
which one will apply the ceiling. This can be tough. Sure, the surface
of the foam can be trimmed back with any number of tools, but then the
protective hard surface is damaged, allowing easier water intrusion.

This is a fairly standardized technique for the insulation of metal
boats, and could be utilized aboard a boat such as Paradox. I can't
imagine that anyone would find a sprayed foam surface to be
attractive, so ceiling (slats or sheet), and it's associated furring
strips would almost certainly have to be installed. The time consuming
task of fitting and gluing sheet foam would be avoided.

I'll be using sheet foam on my boat, but I'm always interested in
other materials, and their applications.
