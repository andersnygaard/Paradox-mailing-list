I don't understand how the "metal angle" shown on page 5 is to be used or attached. Can someone please go into further detail of this? What length angle to get, and is that 1"x1" angle iron?

I've just taken a look at this and it says to bend it from a 2 by 25 strap so in American that is, I think, three thirty seconds by one inch folded down its length.

No! Folded across the way. This is just a little bracket to stop the middle of the side bin flapping about and hold it to the floor panel.

Screw it to the floor panel and drop the bin front into it when you put it in.
