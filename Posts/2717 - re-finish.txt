Subject: Re: Finish

Personally I think there are several.

Any open weave or pinholes will absorb moisture, dirt, oil, scum, 
moss and attract the derision of seabirds who will use if for 
bombing practice:-)

The paint may not stay on as long for the above reasons.

And epoxy needs paint to protect it from the sun.

OK - so where you live the third item will not be a problem:-)

Then I also think that when you consider all the effort you put into 
building something that is of lasting value and will cost a lot to 
replace why not complete the job to a reasonable standard? And I 
don't mean a yacht finish. But even a good work boat has a durable 
finish for the simple reason that it will last longer that way with 
a lot less annual upkeep.
