Subject: Re: Mock up of Hatch

While I was building mine, a friend at work showed an interest, but being a beanpole would not be able to sit inside without his head being severely dented. We came up with a mod that gave him the extra headroom, just as you say. (But he bought a model helicopter instead.)

It would be simple to make a 4" deep footwell.
