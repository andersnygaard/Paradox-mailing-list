Subject: Re: Mainsheet and outboard

But Al, I was always taught to take in any mainsheet slack when jibing. It will save stress on the rig. Mind you. How easy is it in a PARADOX to take in any mainsheet slack when jibing? As the new main sheet horse as I have drawn will be above the outboard motor, the sheet should not foul the motor or the cleats. I have just thought. What if one takes a rubber teething ring about 6" - 8" diameter, The type that dogs play with and tie a bit of shock cord to it, slip it over the outbord motors skeg and tie of to the motor's engine casing with a hook.
