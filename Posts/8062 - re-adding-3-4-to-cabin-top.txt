So if two inches are added to the mast, will the mast be too long to store inside?  How much clearance do completed Paradox's have when storing the mast?  Do navigation lights have to be removed?  While we are at it: What navigation lights have people been pleased with?

The space is fairly tight, I built my own low profile light so it would still fit, the commercial ones were all too tall. You could always make a top hat shaped hatch cover if the mast stuck out beyond the transom
