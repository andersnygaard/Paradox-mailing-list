Hi all,

 In a past post I had inquired about the sheets as I was new to sailing and boat building. I believe, it was Bill S. and Glen M. who stated that they rerouted the main sheet line to run thru the top of the aft deck. In the reply they lead me to pics on the forum of this, so I could see how it was done. It was explained that this was a solution to the outboard motor problem. Hope this helps.

Hi Jimmy

I have a horiible problem with the mainsheet tangle with the outboard motor.. Sometimes I leave the motor down while sailing just to keep this rope free. Steve Yahn

Hi Jimmy,

I made my topping lift so that it holds the boom in the position it is in when the sail is hoist. It is made from a rope at each end of the boom which join and pass through an eye at the top of the mast.

You can see some pictures of it in the "Little Jim" folder in the Photos section.

The only disadvantage I have found is that you have to be careful not to get the yard on the wrong side of it when starting to hoist.

Hoping for calm nights
