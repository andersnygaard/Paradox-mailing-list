Subject: Re: To foam or not to foam...

That's what I used. I faced it with hardboard but it would have been better with thin ply, or perhaps even sticky backed plastic.

Pros: 

Flotation.

Probably not essential, but it is comforting to know that if I am T-boned by a rowing boat it will not actually end up on the bottom.

Insulation, though not needed much in my area. 

Remember it will keep you both hot and cold. I have had comfortable nights afloat when there was half an inch of frost on the deck in the morning.

Cons:

Doesn't look like it's a fun job. 
Expense. 
Loss of storage volume.

Not really a problem unless you are planning ocean crossings, there is masses of storage anyway.

Easily damaged. 
Mildew issues. 

Let me know if I missed something because foamless looks pretty good. I just hate to try and second guess the designer though. 

My experience is that, unless there is serious structural damage, there is negligible chance that floatation will be needed, but I wouldn't like to be without it.
