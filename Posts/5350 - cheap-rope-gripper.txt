Subject: cheap rope gripper

If you use a Paradox-like rope-steering system, and if your hand sometimes gets tired gripping a small diameter line, you might be interested in this device. I got the idea for the steering line system for Slider, my little cat, from Paradox-- it solved many problems for me. I realize that this gripper is probably not any better than a couple strategically placed knots for a boat with a fixed helm position like Paradox. But a cheap rope gripper might have other applications. I'm making up a few to try in my sheet-to-tiller self-steering experiments.

It takes about a buck's worth of PVC to make, but it works like a charm.

It's the most recent post on Slider's blog.
