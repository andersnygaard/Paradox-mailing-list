ahem, kayaker ....could you please stop digging out my unfinished pages ? =C2=A0 =C2=A0 :-/

I should have finished the paragraph about junk sails looong time ago, but I lost my little book on this subject.
And the Paradox/Bigornick system is so simpler than my interest in these sails disappeared.

In fact, my new project has ... Montaubin sails ! (well : a mongrel "Montaubin/Hobie Adventure", actually)

But Yann will draw some sketches to explain his system on the "bigornick plans page", this evening (I think)
and explain how he made the fingers...=C2=A0 :-)
