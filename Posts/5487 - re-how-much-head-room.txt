Brian, 

Just a thought. Today I discovered a boat that is new to me. I saw a boat called a GOAT ISLAND SKIFF. It is about 16 feet long and 5 feet long. It is flat bottomed and has a sail somewhat like the Paradox. While I was looking at it I imagined a cabin and deck on it like a paradox to escape the rain. One would need to be creative to make the two designs work together, I believe. The plans for it are at the same website that sells Michalaks plans, is it "Duckworks" I'm not sure. I'm not saying this is a good idea but I just wanted to throw it out there. Good luck on your hunt for a boat. 

Oh, and thank you for showing me to the Columbia 150 event. What a fun idea. My boat might be broken in by next August. I might even make it a Columbia 300. Go down stream to the messabout and then blow downwind back upstream to the waiting car and boat trailer.
