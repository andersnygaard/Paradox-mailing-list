Hi All,

And Thank you Al & David.

In my opinion you would be best off to give the inside of the mast a couple of coats of epoxy in case any moisture should ever get in. Also in regards to the mast, after all was finished on "Zoe" and I went to stow it in the boat it turned out to be 1 1/2 inch too long because of the anchor light. This is not a big problem because the inspection plate can be left off and some foam wrapped around the light but I had hoped to seal everything up by closing the inspection port while stowed for trailering etc. I rechecked the measurements and they were bang on so it would appear that the height of the anchor light was not taken into consideration in the drawings. Needless to say, it is a little late to cut the mast down so do take the precaution while building to ensure everything will fit when done.

I have uploaded some pictures, They are under the photos and in the Zoe album, more to follow. 

David, congrats on scoring the paradox in Fl. Have you come up with a name? If you look closely in the overall view you can see how the axle is longer (note the extended fenders) and mounted on top of the spring. Also note that the spindle is welded to the top of the axle. In the sail trial fit photo, you can see that the bunk boards are mounted right down on the trailer frame. This all allows me to launch in less than two feet of water. Your trailer is the same size as mine only the axle, fender & bunk board mods need doing to get it to a reasonable height.

Tailwinds,
Glen
