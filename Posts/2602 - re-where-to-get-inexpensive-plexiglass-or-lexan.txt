Not much use to you but here in the UK my local plastics firm often has offcuts left over from jobs. If I adjust my sizes to suit the offcuts I get a bit of discount off the standard square metre price.

I have found that if I send my wife or my son into a firm they get more discount and sometimes free bits! I was at the non ferrous scrappy the other week and they had an aluminium cooking pot about 18" diameter. I thought that it would do for an anchor warp bucket but they wanted more than I was prepared to pay. A few days later I sent the wife in and the guy gave it to her.
