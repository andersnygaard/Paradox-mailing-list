Subject: Re: Snipe


I was just given a 1943 Snipe in need of some TLC. Does anybody have any experience with this old of Snipe? Every thing is original including rigging, spars, and sails. Any advice?

Besides burn it?

Go see these people:

I've gotten several seasons of sailing out of two marginal plywood boats (Sunfish and Lightning) by replacing rotted plywood and covering the outside with epoxy and 4 oz cloth. The epoxy and glass stopped the leaking and helped hold them together. It also allowed me to be fairly quick about the plywood repairs. If the stringers, framing, transom, or centerboard trunk need serious repairs, I don't think a boat would be a good candidate for this process.
