Subject: Day 1 - First day to cut wood on my first DIY boat.
Date: Sun, 11 Jul 2010 04:28:47 -0000

Today I actually cut wood. Although, little has been accomplished; I feel this is a major a milestone.

The scarph joints have intimidated me the most; so I decided I would start with the hull bottom scarph joint first. If I can do that with some feeling of success, it should be downhill from there (or at least mentally).

So I started the scarph joint today, and already have made my first rookie mistake: I haven't used a block plane before - and I just couldn't wrap my head around it, prior to use. From fear of the plane, I decided it would be an ingenious idea to make a series of saw curfs with a backsaw as the primary sculpting method for the joint. Big mistake. Fortunately, I only made one curf before abanding this idea. but now I have to put up with that one curf catching on my plane, every pass. Thank goodness I don't have to deal with a series of those. No real harm, no real foul.

The workspace is set-up now, and is easily accessible for when a can manage to devote time to the project. Forward progress is in reality probably the biggest hurdle for this project. As long as I can keep the momentum going, this should end with a grand reward.

Has anybody used resorcinol on their paradox?
