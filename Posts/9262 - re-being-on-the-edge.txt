Thank you Alistair, I've had a few with the sail caught skirt up all but wrapped around the mast i shook the sheets like mad and they've popped out?
The best ever was a 270 degree uncommanded turn in a rain squall, it was gloomy and the visibility was very poor, no shoreline in sight, I followed the turn on the compass laying on the floor, I added full rudder and did a 360 turn. A big day out including a stingray bigger than the boat, under the boat, one fin either side.
Hope somewhere someone is out sailing.
Nick
