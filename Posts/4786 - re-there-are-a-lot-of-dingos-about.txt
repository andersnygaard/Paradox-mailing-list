Hi Al, Bill.

NOLI is on hold at this moment due to the crappy weather, cold, rain and wind, but as soon as the weather pipes up work will continue. Launch date, I am trying for June.

On the subject of propulsion, I still favour the Yuloh but not as drawn on Matt's drawing. I have been studying the more efficient Japanese VE-SCULL design which has a laminar flow. http://www.amateurboatbuilding.com/articles/howto/sculling_oar/index.html I have already been thinking of a simple improvement and have ordered a length of spruce.

As far as modifications to existing designs, in particular PARADOX, the only way to get more headroom in the design is to lower the cabin sole(floor) and leave out the 2" foam in the roof. This will give an extra 3-4 inches. One could also laminate the roof, as I did on NOLI, off the boat and save a beam. It should be remembered that PARADOX was designed to cruise for up to 2 months without the need for shore support.

The gap under NOLI's cabin sole forward and aft of bulkead 3 was made to take a 2litre water bottle. This will give me 32 litres about a weeks supply. There is plenty of space to store more. Taking the opening in bulkhead 2 flush with the floor, as I did on NOLI, will give extra leg room. There are several things one can do to give more headroom inside without altering the outside.

Here's a question to all PARADOX owners. How much of PARADOX's storage space do you use, and how of that stuff do you use, or how much could you do without and is it just there to fill a space?
