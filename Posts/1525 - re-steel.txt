I think you'd gain the advantages of simpler and faster construction, and a hull that would be damaged on beaching or holed by surprise impacts (other than icebergs or Exocet missiles.)

Meaning it would be more prone to damage Bill??

I have another idea on top of the steel.... I have a roll of 12 oz biax without mat backing, I could biax the steel skinned hull? does fabric work with a steel base the same or better than it does with plywood??
