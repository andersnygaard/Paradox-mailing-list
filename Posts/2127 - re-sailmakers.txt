In message 2020 Glen had this to say about making the Paradox sail:

"Before you build your sails make sure you have your yard made 
because you will have to measure the deflection in it when hoisted 
to allow for the bend. Best to have both boom and yard built so as 
to make sure the sleeves will be more then adequate. My first sail 
was built by a so called professional (even has a sail loft in St. 
Augustine) who didn't know to take into consideration yard bend. So 
$500 later I was ordering a new sail from Dabbler who does know how 
to build these sails and I am extremely pleased with the new one. If 
you have your yard built then support it by the ends on sawhorses, 
chair back exc. and hang fifty pounds in the center. Stretch a 
string tightly from each end and measure the deflection from the 
string to the yard at the 1/4, 1/2 and 3/4 points. Transfer these 
measurements to a paper pattern and you will have the shape of the 
top of the sail. Matt likes to add lots of draft into these sails 
and I would refer you to his comments in the New Sail folder in the 
files section for more info. This should get you started, I highly 
recommend the sail building manuals put out by Sail-rite."

Glen seemed pleased with his new sail from Dabbler when I last spoke 
to him,  and I have heard other positive reports about this 
sailmaker.  Dabbler's website is at http://www.dabblersails.com/.
