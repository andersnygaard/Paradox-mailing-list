Subject: Water tight boot on the Paradox tiller arm

If one installs a "permanent" watertight boot on the Paradox tiller arm, then one should install a small dorad or mushroom vent on the aft deck to replace the lost of the open tiller arm port for ventilation. This ventilation on the aft deck should have a watertight heavy weather cover that can be installed for major storms to permit the boat capsizing without floding by the ventilation system. However, if the water tight boot is a removable installation for storms only, you can retain the tiller arm port opening for fair weather ventilation and you wont require a dorad or mushroom vent on the aft deck. This is the route that I would prefer (to have my cake and eat it too)...
