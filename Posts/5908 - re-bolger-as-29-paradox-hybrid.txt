I know its the Jessie Cooper and that it is 1 generation earlier. The Bolger AS-19 AS-29 and AS-39 all have the same hull shape. I chose that picture because it shows it beached out of the water.

The (A)dvanced (S)harpie series of boats can be found here.

A distant view of the AS-29

Also look for BOLGER SQUARE BOATS. Chine runners would not help and would only hinder those designs which have no trouble tracking to begin with.

Andrew,

Close but one generation earlier. I think that is a Jessie Cooper on the cover of Boats with an Open Mind. Similar in shape to the AS-29 I think. Also your description isn't that far from a description of paradox. Heavy ballasted boat, pronounced rocker, same for the chine shape. That is why the chine has a significant fillet on its top side. The bottom is curved. Who knows, chine runners might work. It wouldn't take that much to add them although the slots for the bilge boards could cause complications.

Sincerely,
Gene T.

Has anyone built a bolger 29 with chine runners ? Would it be feaseable . What would be the pros and cons . I am presently just dreaming of building one . I would like to combine the bolger and paradox with a ketch junk rig.
Cheers
