Hi,

How do you intend to sheet the sail? A bumpkin-pole I presume?
The sail is certainly much further aft than most boats, I guess 
because of the chine-runners, and the large part played by the 
rudder. I saw a picture somewhere of a Paradox (Matt's original one I 
think) with a forward extension of the runners being added as a mod. 
I wonder if the current plans include this change, and whether it 
made/makes any practical difference to the clr, anyone know? 
I love the look of the junk-rig but cant claim to have ever used one 
other than a hybrid batwing type on a canoe, but it seems just 'too-
hard' to do on Paradox. Maybe if you added a very small centreboard 
way forward tho like LittleCruiser...or a leeboard? But then its 
getting more and more complex, less and less Paradox.
But still, I hope you succeed, by whatever means- you must be sold on 
the advantages of the rig, like most people who've used it it seems!

Cheers,
Alan.
