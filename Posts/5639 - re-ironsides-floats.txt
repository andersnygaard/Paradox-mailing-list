Thank you Jim

I would be very glad to give any and all help with using my design. 
After I am sure it is correct by testing it in bad wheather and also 
some space of time in addition. I have not made any drawings of it 
yet. I mostly used bits of material I just happened to have on hand. 
Not the first choice, for other people, to necessarily follow. But 
still It may be fine just as it is anyway. It needs testing. Steve

Hi Stephen

The photos look marvellous as does the boat! Best was the great big 
grin in the very last photo. The absolute feeling of satisfaction 
with a beautiful job well done must be wonderful.

I do have one question in particular. The tack strop looks very 
well designed and I know that you had a concern about how well the 
more rigid design will work in practice. Please let us know how it 
does. If it is successful, as it probably will be, could you post a 
detailed drawing of it to be incorporated into the plans? Perhps you 
already have and I've missed it or just forgotten about it.

Many happy hours and miles under the keel - oops, chine runners.

Enjoy 
Jim Baltaxe
