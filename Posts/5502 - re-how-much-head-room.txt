Subject: Re: How much head room?

You are free to take offense to that, but that was not my intention. 
 I was just trying to point out to Bryan that there was a boat similar
to the Paradox that had more headroom, and would be an easier build.

You are right to say that you could add all the niceties to the
Robbsboat, but if you were going to do that, you might as well build a
Paradox.

I'm a bit biased here.  I have often thought of building a Robbsboat,
but have not.  I'd like to see one get built, even of it is done by
someone other than myself.  

On the same note, I admire ANYONE who had the determination to build
ANYTHING.  My own boat project is now 2.5 years old and I'm just now
starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel.    I have a bit
more glassing inside the hull, and then paint.  The spars, mast,
rudder, and leeboard are done.  Only the junk sail is then left to
build!   Last week I dug out my old sewing machine to start that
process rolling.
