If the motor protrudes above the top of the transom then it will be more likely to get caught as the sheets will brush across it on every tack.

Jeffs idea sounds interesting but, in his side view, if you store the motor tilted like this you will rip off the leg the first time you have a serious jibe. the sheet will be slack as the boom goes across and will go under the o/b leg.

My own thoughts tended towards a metal hoop cage around an o/b on a lifting bracket, but then I decided it probably wasn't worth the effort (and where do you store the fuel?)

If I do anything at all now it will most likely be an electric o/b stored inside and mounted alongside the steering position when in use.

I've probably asked this before but don't recall an answer.
I will be using an outboard on my boat. Does it make sense to fasten the mainsheet on top of the rear deck and take the free end through the top of the deck rather than the transom? I am thinking that it will be less likely to foul the outboard. Any thoughts appreciated. Cheers
