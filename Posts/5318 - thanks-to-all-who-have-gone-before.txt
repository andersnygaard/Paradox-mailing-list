Subject: Thanks to all who have gone before

Wow,

I can easily see that if I come anywhere close to my deadline/goal it is because of all you who have gone before and left an excellent imprint. As I go over the plans and work on this thing almost all my questions have been answered by searching this board or looking at all the great pics and documentation. I think my job today would be much, much, more difficult without this source of information.

Thank-you so much for helping me to fulfill a dream.

Rod
