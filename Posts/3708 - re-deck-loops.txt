Subject: Re: Deck Loops

Mine are copper water pipe. I glued a block under the deck, drilled a hole half way through and glued them in. Being tube they are the weakest thing on the outside of the boat, I live in fear that someone will hold me alongside by grabbing one and it will just bend, still this is my third season and it's still ok .....

Tip: Make the stbd one as low as possible, no more than a semicircle and less if you can manage the fixing. I made both sides the same, which means that there is about 3 inches vertical pipe before the curve. Any lines (anchor etc.) on deck can easily get wrapped round this. The vertical section makes it that much more difficult to slip it off again.
