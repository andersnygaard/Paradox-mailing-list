I don't know where my previous reply to your post went but anyway:
The boom sheet through the hole above the baffle is clever. Has the sheet ever snagged on your outboard using this arrangement?

Further to the query.
I've posted some pictures showing 2 of the water bladders in position on the starboard side. I can squeeze 4 in per side and they weigh 7 Kgs each.
You may also notice that the rear hatch is partioned off so that I can get at my food stores without having to lift the thwart and do some contortionists moves.

Someone (maybe you) also asked about the sheeting which is not per plan.
Again in the photo set you will see the arrangment both above and below deck which I find works well.
The sheet enters the boat via a fairlead mounted above the rear baffle. It immediately goes around a turn around block mounted on the transom.
It's then fed to a cam cleat on bulkhead 4.

You can also see the tiller extension which folds back under the tiller when not in use (held by a SS pin).

Also on the starboard side, a red line leading from a fairlead on the transom is the Yuloh downhaul which is cleated off to a small cleat on the starboard carlin.
