It's an interesting concept, but a fairly inefficient use of core material, unless one really expects a lot of contacts with rocks and logs, and that stuff is certainly out there, and further doesn't believe the other comon methods of dealing with them like crushable bows, are likely to work.  The other issue would be whether the materials in question are localy flexible in such a small boat.  Anyway, you will have a fantastic boat, with additional bouyancy, and reduced thermal conductivity.  It sounds like an excellent project.
