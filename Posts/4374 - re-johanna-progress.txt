I discovered that while the transom is shown with camber on its side
panel edges, the camber was not specified. I incorporated 5mm of
camber to these edges, as well as the side panel edges of bulkhead #4.

I've marked my transom with straight sides. Is this right? Should I 
add 5mm camber to it and Bulkhead 4? I'd like to get these finished 
during the week.

Have a look at this photo of 'Faith's' transom
http://www.smallsailboats.co.uk/paradox/build/stern_view.jpg
which has the 5mm of curvature on either side. I think it adds 
something to the appearance. Others may prefer to have absolutely 
straight sides.


Tommorrow I'm going to rip some strips of 6mm marine ply and build a 
deck beam. If this is solid enough I will use marine ply for all the 
others.

I used ply for all of my beams.  Have a look at:
http://www.smallsailboats.co.uk/paradox/build4.htm
and any of the early build pages from links there.


Another question. I've got quite a bit of stock kiln dried pine. I 
don't think it's normally recommended for boat building, but would it 
be any good for side and bin cleats etc.? If not I'll pick up some 
Douglas fir at the weekend.

Try knocking some bronze ring nails of the right size into the pine 
to see if it splits.  If it does then buy the Douglas fir.

Bill.

Thanks
