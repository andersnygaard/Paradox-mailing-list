Subject: Re: Bottom Paint

What bottom paint you need depends on several factors:

* Tropical or temperate water conditions
* Hull material
* Fresh vs. tidal vs. marine waters
* Frequent haul-out vs. mostly in the water

Eep, so if I sail my Paradox in the frigid waters of Lake Ontario until the lake freezes, then trail to Key Largo to cruise the Bahamas until the lake unfreezes again, I need to repaint the bottom twice?  I probably needed to do it once anyway for annual maintenance, but eep.
