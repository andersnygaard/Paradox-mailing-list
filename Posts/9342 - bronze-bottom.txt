Subject: Bronze bottom?
Date: 30 Jan 2019 17:45:21 +0000

I am at the beginning of my paradox adventure and I have been contemplating fitting a thin bronze plate (3-5mm probably) to the underside of my hull to act as ballast, and a thick skin to prevent damaging the fiberglass upon beach landings or unwanted encounters with shoal. 

I'm curious to know if anyone has done something similar with their paradox and how they went about doing so? I would also love to hear any reasons why it may be a bad idea.

Sven's exlex minor has a very similar plate (though thicker than I desire). I would also like to put a smaller piece nearer to the bow specifically for protection while beaching her. Please let me know what you guys think, any information regarding bronze plating over ply would be much appreciated as I am entirely inexperienced in that area.
