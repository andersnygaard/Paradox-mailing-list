There is nowhere that you could put a lamp that would be above eye height, so I think it would tend to dazzle a bit. (My internal lighting is with LEDs in the roof)

When my wife and I lived aboard our little 20' canoe yawl, we also used our gimballed kerosene lamp as a heat source when the temps were mild and we were underway. I wonder if such a lamp would be practical aboard a Paradox, or just an imposing novelty?
