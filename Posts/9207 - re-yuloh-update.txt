Hi Deric,

I'm glad they applauded. Americans must be nicer than NZ'ers. If I carried out a yuloh test in my marina, observers would be making snide comments like "what's wrong with an OB motor!" and "where are you planning to go in that boat? Around the world? Ha,ha ha.., that guy's an idiot!"

As for your tests, yulohing is a funny business, the act of travelling through the water and yulohing at the same time, keeps the yuloh on it's pivot. As soon as you stop, it floats off. It took me a while to get that coordinated (it still floats off occasionally), but once you do, you can yuloh in quite rough conditions.

Keep us posted. That maiden voyage must be very close now!

Cheers,

Rob.
