Or the sail has a short boom then enlarges batten by batten then reduces in length to the yard. You get these beautiful curves on the leech of some junkrigs.

The sheets are way back on junkrigs yes. Writing is rewriting and rigging is rerigging, I suppose. Sailing will always be a work in progress. Maybe the sail is enlarges as it gets higher. The boom being shorter than the yard. Is this ridiculous? But it may solve the sheet/aft rigging issue. Jack I don't know what you mean when you refered to 'red' and 'reds.'

In a traditional junk rig the sheets lead aft so as to be clear of the sail and the ends of the ribs. I'm not sure how you would do that on paradox with the. Red to have the sail as far aft as it. Reds to be for balance.

for balance

Perhaps the cleverest thing to do with an aerorig is not rig an aerorig. Has anyone tried a cambered junkrig on any of Matt's boats? The cambers erasing the to windward deficits of the old school flat junksail.

To fit a Bermudan rig you'd need to add shrouds and stay(s),
unless you did something clever with an aerorig (which you can Google).
To add leeboards you don't necessarily need to remove the chine runners:  just add battens for the boards to bear against clear of the runners.

No sign of shrouds, so it must be difficult to get any luff tension
