Hi Pete.

NOLI is being built from Far Eastern marine ply.

The difference between this and the Basic marine ply will more than pay for my sail.

Overall, the Far Eastern seems to do the job, but I did have a small patch on the deck edge by the mast that started to delaminate. A squirt of glue and tape it down, a cap strip and a covering of glass, no one will be the wiser.

Most of my ply came from a local boat yard and was manufactured in Israel.

Some of the internal parts, cabin sole, bins, etc., can be made from external ply if you are picky. There is some good external ply out there if you have the time to look.

I give these parts a couple of coats of clear primer sealer with extra on the end grain. Sanding down lightly after the first coat.

I have built NOLI using MAS Low Viscosity Epoxy Resin from http://www.wilsonswebsolutions.com/me/ here in the UK.

By the way. In the States, epoxy resin seems a lot cheaper. Here in the UK 6 liters of MAS costs about £66.00 
MAS resin is of a low blush type that has a very low wax bleed through after it has cured.

I have not had a problem of sandpaper clogging up when sanding fresh cured resin.
