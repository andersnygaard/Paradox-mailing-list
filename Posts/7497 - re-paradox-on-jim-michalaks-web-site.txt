Jim, you took the words out out my mouth:) 

Folks will spend hundreds on an outboard but use a tarp and expect the boat to sail like a champion:( 

I don't have a Paradox but love the little boat and will build one someday. I don't know how he deviated from Matts plans, but I'm building a Wharram catamaran right now and am shocked at the builder modes to his design. I know it's hard to stick to the plans but that's probably the best course.
