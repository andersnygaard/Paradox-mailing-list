Jeff,

Which sailmaker is making your sail?
I've been surfing around for someone who specialises in lug sails, 
for a quotation. I was about to email a few people, but would be 
interested in who you have picked.

I'm not sure if a need to make the yard first so that I can check the 
stiffness before I order.

Wish I could find acrylic sheet for =A36!
Looks like mine will be closer to =A3100 for a full sheet, but shopping 
round locally for offcuts like yourself.

Pete
