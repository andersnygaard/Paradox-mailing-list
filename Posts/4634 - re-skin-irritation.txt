Gorilla glue. I like it. Much faster than epoxy. It is a different base
chemistry than epoxy. Wear rubber gloves as it stains the skin
black/dark. I sometimes remove it from my skin with sandpaper if its
thick enough.

Hello all, 
Having begun to laminate the curved deck beams using West System
epoxy, 
I've now got a nasty case of skin rash, mainly on my arms, hands and 
face. Very itchy and painful. 
I have taken the recommended precautions re gloves, clothing etc, and 
having been doing the work in the shed with door wide open. Perhaps I 
should have worn a good mask when stirring the mix? I've not done any 
epoxy sanding yet so it can't be that.
It would seem I'm one of those who will have to use some other epoxy, 
or get a good mask? Any suggestions most welcome.
