Fantastic Al. Thanks so much for sharing your experience.

When I first saw the Paradox righting moment graph, I wondered how the weight of the crew rolling around the interior would affect the numbers. In my case, there will be 225 lbs of sailor within the interior. Slap the mast in the drink, and I'm betting that I'm sprawled on the leeward bins. I suppose that that's about the time when the water ballast really comes into play.

Sounds like you had a good time. Can't wait to see some more photos.
