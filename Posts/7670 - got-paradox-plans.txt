Subject: Got Paradox plans

I just got the Paradox plans from Dave Bolduc. The first set he sent got lost somewhere in the postal service and Dave was kind enough to resend them as well as E-mailing me the PDF version of the plans. The larger printed version looks great and although the PDF version and my printed 8-1/2 x 11 copy would have worked, the bigger printed plans that Dave sent were worth the wait.
