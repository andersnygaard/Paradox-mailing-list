Hi Glen,

=A3340 is a bargain, surely one of our members MUST buy this PARADOX at that price, all right $500. Sod the recession chaps, one of you has to go for it. We can't have a non member buying it. I wonder how much it would cost to ship it over to the Old country?
Glen I am sorry I sent two e-mails on the same subject, but when I pressed 'send', the e-mail disappeared, and for about 5 minuets I looked without luck to find it, so I wrote another. Blame it on Microsoft ME, everyone else does.
I am glad to hear that you have nine boats. I thought I was a bit in need of therapy when I had five, but I am now down to just two. And I sleep well when the wind blow's.
We have all been told on both sides of the 'Pond' to spend our way out of this recession, so I am doing my bit and have ordered the material to build a my PARADOX derivative. 
As I only have a lean-to on the back of the house to build in, work will start next spring.

Jeff. May the strong wind behind you never be your own.
