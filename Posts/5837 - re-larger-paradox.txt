I'm not thinking of building a 28-footer, but my understanding of DO NOT SCALE is not to take measurements off the drawings by using a rule or any other measuring tool and scaling them up, becuase in all probability nothing will fit properly.

My interpretation is that 4.2 meter boat on a drawing should build to 
4.2 meter in reality.

Its not rocket-science to design a boat, but there is quite a number of 
details to fit together. And they affect eachother in not so obvious ways.

The designer has allready done conciderably thinking on how things like 
length, weight, sail-area and so on, will fit together.

This boils down to the chicken and egg problem.
If you do know how to modify a design you allready have what it takes to 
make your own design. So why bother "scaling"?

So for the rest of us, including myself, stick to plan!
