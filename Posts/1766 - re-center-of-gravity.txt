This is an excellent idea. Don't forget though that many in cabin injuries have been caused by flying objects. Make sure your lockers are up to it. You might want to pad sharp corners or better yet, router them round and then pad (with pipe insulation?)

After reading "Alone Against the Atlantic" by Gerry Spies I'm actually thinking of installing seat belts at shoulder, thigh and shin level just in case. They could be made fast to eye bolts on the cabin sole outboard so as not to interfere with normal activity and kept in a locker in case they were ever needed.

I'd be interested to read other folks' ideas in regard to securing the sailor to the sole. Velcro pants... belt and after centerline snaphook... automotive seatbelt... bubblegum... [is it] necessary?
