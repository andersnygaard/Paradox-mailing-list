Subject: Re: Top to water ballast tank

You have coated the underside of the top, haven't you?

I put on masses of thickened glue, and then reached in through the 
access hatches and spread the squeezed-out glue into a fillet with 
my 
thumb (inside disposable gloves). That seems to have been quite 
successful as I have had no leaks there (the inspection hatches on 
the other hand .......)

That's the way I plan to do it.

Thanks,
Bill,
