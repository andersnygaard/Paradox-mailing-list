Hello...

I do not know you or you me - but I believe you are being a 'big dummie' - you don't need to burn the bridges that have served you in the past in an effort to deal with the future - I just made that up - hehehe...

Burning bridges is for soldiers - adolescents - and mad men...

Besides - I personally would be more interested in having you about and seeing photos and notes of your next build and knowing how the fight with 'Gods given body' goes - life is full of challenges - taxes and death are the only things that are certain...

I also believe that positive focus can cure all ills - don't stop what you are doing just because the Gods put a hurdle in front of you - they are just testing your courage and 'gumf'...

Trust me on this - I have my own bits to deal with - there are days when it leads to sadness - but I fight it - sometimes there is just nothing else to do...

If I hit any nerves - I will not apologise - fight - work - laugh - say 'morning sunshine' when it comes over the horizon - as it always does - 'cept on overcast days - but it is still there...

DAMNIT...

Cheers...
