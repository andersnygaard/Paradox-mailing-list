Roselt,

Thanks for posting your story. In the circumstances you found yourself in, and if you hadn't had access to a tow, I'm wondering if there would have been a benefit to deploying either a drogue or a sea anchor until more favorable winds arrived? The idea being that they might have stabilized your boat and thus reduce your sea sickness, plus they might have slowed your drift into shore.

Another (heretical) question I have was whether chine runners really provide sufficient leeway prevention in tight situations? Would you have been better off with a more conventional daggerboard or centerboard? Some may know of the Swede Sven Yrvind http://www.yrvind.com/, and his attempts to sail small boats long distances. As I recall he has conversed with Matt Layden and tried chine runners on his boats, but eventually went back to some sort of board.
