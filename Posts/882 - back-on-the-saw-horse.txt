My Paradox-in-progress (early stages) and my boat shed were destroyed by large trees which were knocked down in a violent windstorm last New Years Eve. 

Though I did plan on starting over right away, I guess devastation and disappointment killed my enthusiasm - until now. I'm starting to cut out pieces again.

My question is -  Now that I have a chance to start over, is there anything I need to know about the beginning stages of building that has changed or been discovered in the last 6 months or so? Anything you would do differently if you had a chance to start over?

Thank you
