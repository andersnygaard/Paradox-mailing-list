Subject: Re: Question for Paradox sailors

Hi Jake,

Welcome to the group!

See my previous post about checking out the files and links sections here for more background information. One other discussion group is moderated by Dave and Mindy Bolduc who purchased the boat that the Paradox designer had before designing Paradox. Their "Little Cruiser" is more conventional in design with a centerboard and a more conventional rig. They go sailing with Mat in his Paradox and are amazed at the capability.

You have to understand that Paradox is a special design and every facet of it is important to its sailing ability. It must have enough weight on board to get the chine runner down when heeled and the cut of the sail is very important.

Then of course comes the skill of the sailor since  a lug sail must be handled a bit differently than a conventional sloop.

Everybody who has built one has been very pleased with the performance once they get the hang of how it sails.

Cheers, Nels
