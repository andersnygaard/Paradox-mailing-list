Sorry, not an experienced grouper yet.

The reason I asked about T12 was not how to buy it from US, since shipping thinner to me across the atlantic doesn't make sense, but to find a similar (or same) product under another name here (in Sweden).

Strange, this web, today I can get contact with fiberglass coatings and get to know that T12 is alcohols and ketones, not much but a starter.

Sorry, Glen, for the inconvenience.
