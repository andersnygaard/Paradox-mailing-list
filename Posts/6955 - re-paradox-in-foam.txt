Subject: Re: paradox in foam


The design of the paradox in plywood is part of the need to get great weight into the finished design. The chine runners need to be well submerged to do their work. If the boat were built of lightweight foam the overall "gestalt" of the design is upset. Also, you would become a designer yourself and not be tied to this "exact" design. It may be awkward for anyone to give handy advice too.
