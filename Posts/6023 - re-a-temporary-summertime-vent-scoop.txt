Hi John

I think I understand your design and it certainly would work but I expect that it would work better as an exhaust than an intake. I guess I'm trying to say nicely that your design sucks. Sorry about that; I just couldn't resist. Perhaps if it had a sort of top cap on it, supported by a hoop?

 Enjoy
