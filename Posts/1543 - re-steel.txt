That is a very interesting concept. A composite of wood and steel hull might be very useful on certain hulls. Might be easy to make a centerboard and trunk out of steel and then just attach the whole thing. Especially if the hull was designed with that in mind.

I am wondering how much care will have to be taken in the fabrication process to avoid stress once the hull has cooled. Will some of it have to be preheated to stress relieve it during or after fabrication.

Also about corrosion. Will some zinc anodes have to be used to prevent electrolysis?
