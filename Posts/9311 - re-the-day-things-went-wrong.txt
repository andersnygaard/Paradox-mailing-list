Subject: Re: The day things went wrong

Reading some of Thor Hyerdahls books on his stormy experiences in open boats , then rafts , it's easy to see that open ocean sailing can be done in small craft ,and can be bloody scary too
He is a champion of small craft over larger ones , just re read his book Fatu Hiva and a small part of that is devoted to discussing small boats and rafts .
I'm inspired by his travels and his courage and he couldn't swim !
I can swim but am not as courageous .

One couple drove an amphibious jeep , called half safe , around the world , towing a fuel tank , look it up it's astonishing what they did .
I'm learning bit by bit , So I'm still in gulf waters in sight of land and am slowly building up to more open water 
The handicap is in South Australia , that the distance between recognised ports , means night sailing 
Then to get in from the Southern Ocean , negotiating reef openings , sand bars and breaking waves that have come uninterrupted from the polar ice cap , add strong winds and you've got a recipe for roll over and shipwreck .
Small open stretches of water how ever,  on perfect days , are doable 
So looking at maps and driving around looking first hand at the bay's and beaches has my hopes up
There are Paradox safe beaches 
I'm going to the State Library to study more if they will make charts available and really try and get my head around the idea.

Has anyone beached and launched in surf , I wonder 
A section in a sailing book printed turn of the last century talks of dragging weights behind a boat to slow it and keep it pointed when beaching in surf
Even running the weight of the bow and backing into the beach
All fair enough , but how to get out over curling waves , a Yuloh ain't going to do that neither is my 2.4 hp Honda motor .

One chap at 47 years of age kayaked around Oz
Two days and nights continuos rowing across the Great Australian Bight 
Wow
The Bight is too far for me in a paradox .
But other large stretches of coast might be adventurous without being suicidal 

Lots of inspiration out there 
Hope more folk write of their sailing on a Paradox
