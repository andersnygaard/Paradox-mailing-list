Subject: Re: Epoxy and Varnish


Thanks Glenn and Wayne.

I don't think that I have got a dead knot because the one end that is showing is secure in the wood. The other end has shrunk. There is enough space to get a hypodermic needle in so I'm going to inject epoxy in around the knot.

It didn't show until I'd shaped the boom. I mean to say the knot show on the unplaned wood but I didn't see that it was shrunken at the one end until I had planed and shaped. (Now I'm wondering has one end of the knot shrunk or has the timber in that area recoiled from the knot?) :0)

Next boat I'll examine the wood better in the rough. I bought from Robbins Timber in Bristol via the net because they are noted suppliers of timber for boat builders. I have since found a timber importer about 40 minutes drive away so the next time I need a length of D. Fir I'll go and select it myself. I've also got a better idea of what to look for as a result of my Paradox building experience. 
Also, Enuf has caused me to buy a table saw so I can now buy oversize and choose my cuts myself. There is quite a saving to be had in buying a baulk rather paying the timber merchant to cut to size.

cheers  .....   Derek
