i have enjoyed the postings!

while reading all i can on paradox i have also been following Yrvind's progress as he builds his revolutionary vessel which owes much to Matt Layden.

interestingly he has chosen to enclose it entirely in divinycell (pvc foam) 2 inches for the hull and something less for the deck house.

is there anyone on this forum who is considering building in the same material?
