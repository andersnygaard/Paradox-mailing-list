Subject: Re: Vent Trunk Drain

I used the 22mm. Drilling for the 32mm could be tricky. Because the ventilation hole in the deck is only 120mm in diameter I doubt sufficient water would enter it at any one time by the action of waves to fill the vent box before it would drain away.
The strongest wind strength I've sailed 'Faith' in has been brief periods of force 6 when waves never came near to breaking on the deck.  Even if the vent box were to fill occasionally the amount of water entering the cabin would be minimal.
