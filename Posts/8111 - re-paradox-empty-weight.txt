Hi Chris,

I thought we were both going to be building at the same time.  Now you've gone and bought one instead!  Be sure to tell us how you go with your early sailing experiences.  I need constant inspiration over here.  Currently working on the bulkhead cleats.  To my knowledge only one NZ Paradox exists.  Mine will be the second.

Cheers,
