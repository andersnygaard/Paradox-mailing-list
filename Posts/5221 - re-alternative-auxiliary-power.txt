Subject: Re: Alternative auxiliary power...

When I enquired about a motor for LJ everyone told me that I would need at least 54lb thrust for a boat that heavy. I found a dealer willing to let me try and found that the 28lb was fine for my requirements, giving me a max speed of 3 knots. 
I suspect it is similar to the arguments we get here about 'performance'. If you wanted to get the absolute maximum and reach hull speed they may have been right, but think of the power consumption.

Hoping for calm nights,
