Hello,

I wanted to share some information about the installation of the yuloh stowage rail. The strongest way to install the rail is the way Glen described it. However, if you prefer not to make it "permanent" then another option is to make the rails a little different and just bolt them on. Little Cruiser had them installed this way and I have had the rails off for years. But now, I am replacing them because we will be carrying our yuloh on our next trip this year. You can see this arrangement on the attached photo.

Thank you,
Dave
