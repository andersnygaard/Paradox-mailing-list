Subject: Re: resorcinol

Hello Bobby,

I'd be interested to hear about your experience of using resorcinol. I used epoxy only when I built Small Fry, but have since wondered about alternatives. Epoxy is very easy to use, and I've had good results with it for gluing (less convinced about it's strength for glassing which sometimes seems to peel too easily). The trouble with epoxy however is its big price tag.

Cheers,
Geoff (Australia).
