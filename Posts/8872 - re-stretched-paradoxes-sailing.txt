You might be able to compare them by installing a temporary chine runner to the port chine. On the port tack the chine runner should be above the water  - if the wind is strong enough - and on the starboard tack raise the leeboard and see how the chine runner does. Do about 10-12 tacks. If you have a GPS should be able to compare. Of course one has to compensate for any currrent and changes in wind conditions etc. It was suggested one time a person could make a temp chine runner from solid type foam using a surfoam plane and some waterproof tape.
