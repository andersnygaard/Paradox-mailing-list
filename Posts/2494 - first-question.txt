Hello,

I'm looking for some information on building a Paradox boat and was wondering if anyone who has completed building one can tell me the approximate cost with sails but no motor. Also, has anyone used two-part polyurethane spray paints for the hull and deck? I've heard they are the toughest paint available and I want to get a sense of the expense for the boat and its coating costs.

Thank you,
Seapearl Hull Number 2, MC
