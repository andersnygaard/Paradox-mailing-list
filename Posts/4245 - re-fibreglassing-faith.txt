Subject: Re: Fibreglassing 'Faith'

I'm going to have get a move on, if 'Faith' is to be afloat by the beginning of June.  I do have the advantage that I'm retired and if the weather is good for building and there are no other pressing demands, I'll be enjoying the fun of building.

I don't remember if '03 was a particularly mild winter, but I would expect that I wasn't putting in many hours a day in my unheated garage that January and February. I do remember the epoxy took a long time to go off.

Hoping for calm nights
