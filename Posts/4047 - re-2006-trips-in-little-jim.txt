Al and Jeff

Thanks for the replies.
The headroom issue is one of the things that puts me off the Paradox.  I would find it uncomfortable to sit on the sole for a longish time.

Even a low seat would make a big increase in comfort for me, so every inch (or three) of additional headroom would be very welcome.

The idea of the sheet steel outside was to maintain the ballast ratio with the weight in the most effective place. The steel could be galvanised naturally.

Al's idea of copper would give some anti-fouling properties but is that really needed when you could simply beach the boat to rub off any growth?

Al, do you get much bilge water inside?
