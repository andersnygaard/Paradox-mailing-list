Hi Derek,

I am sorry to hear of your Carpel Tunnel problem and hope you are back to normal very soon.

On the point that Bill Sergeant mentioned the other day- sleeping in the boat while it's on the trailer-presumably en route to a new cruising ground.

Do many do that ? Do you just pull into a lay-bye, climb into the boat and get your head down. Or pop into a camp site...;-)

I thought that there were rules that prevented folk dossing in lay-byes. ........perhaps they are not enforced that much and anyway, who could know that the owner is having a kip in the back?

I have done it in my motor cruiser, and would certainly consider doing it in the Paradox.

By the way, don't park in a remote layby. I have done that and have usually been knocked up in the middle of the night by the police, though I have never been moved on when I explained how tired I was and I thought it wasn't safe. For an undisturbed night park on a residential road. Then everyone assumes you belong to one of the houses.

Hoping for calm nights,

Al,
