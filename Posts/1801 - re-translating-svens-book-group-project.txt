Subject: Re: Translating Sven's Book: Group Project?

Okay I will follow up with my contacts. What I would suggest is - if you get the go ahead - to scan each chapter separately into pdf format and just send one at a time via email. That way it doesn't overload one person and you can keep track of who has what. 

I beleive there are several Swedes right in our group and one fellow from Finland and one from Norway who both have also done some translating for us previously. Some fellows are a bit reluctant as to their ability to translate and then end up having better English than we have! 

I know Sven is a bit of a perfectionist so he will want to approve the final version. Kjell might also do some review work too. I have done some work in preparing teaching manuals so picking out grammar errors is a natural thing for me. (Other people's not my own of course;-)

Maybe we will have to do a documentary in English too!

Cheers, Nels
