Subject: Tiller Rope Lock

I considering how to rig a tiller Lock. I would love to know how
others have done this.
I thought to use a piece of plywood with a steep sided V notch to jam
the tiller rope into. And mount the notch under the hanging knee area.
Since the pull may come from two directions, at times, the ordinary
jam/cam cleats don't seem usable.
