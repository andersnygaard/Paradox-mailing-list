Subject: Re: Rudder ropes

If you pull on the right rope the tiller moves to port.
The boat moves to Starboard, not Port
It becomes second nature after about 30 seconds of use.
It's like riguiding a horse.

Last year I had a go on some Hobbie SOTs including the Adventure Island.
This has a tiny thumb operated tiller. To steer to starboard you push the
tiller to starboard!
I can't imagine who designed it like that.

I had a few close calls where I went to head upwind to avoid someone and
ended up bearing down on them at full pelt....
