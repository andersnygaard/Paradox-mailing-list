Subject: Re: Scaling Paradox and Other Questions

This is a pretty common question.

The chine runners are a relatively new concept so every new design which uses them is somewhat of an experiment.  The chine runners will probably work on sharpies with a good amount of rocker and a good amount of ballast.  Unfortunately there are not many nautical architects that focus on this innovation.  If you want a larger design, you may have to experiment on a scaled up design similar hull shape.

Here are a few larger sharpie design websites:

I believe the chine runner concept will work on larger boats, but have not seen any examples.
