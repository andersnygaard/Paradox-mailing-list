Hi all,

The last couple of weeks the weather has been kind to us in the UK, and as my daughter has exams coming up outings in the motor boat (floating caravan) have had to be shelved. This has resulted in a flurry of building.

I had completed just about everything I could while the garage was still empty, so last weekend I assembled the sides to the bulkheads. Next the sheer strakes went in, came out, were glued and went in again. All ok so far!

Next, turn it over......   In Dons' article he says 'this is easily done without outside assistance'. I can only assume that he wasn't doing it in a garage with only 2 feet clear on either side. 2 of us did finally manage it, but I don't know how we are going to get it back once the bottom is on (though I do have a seed of a plan using my sons' skateboard).

So onward...  The chine logs went in.... just. It took about 3 hours to get them temporarily in position. There was no way I could do that while the glue was going off, and anyway I was not sure that I could keep them under control while I got them back out. So I left them in, opened up the joint with a small wedge and squidged glue into the gap. Lots of nails later and it looks ok, with glue squeezing out in the right places.

Got to leave it now while I mow the lawn or there will be a revolution in the ranks. Altogether a very satisfactory couple of weeks.

Hoping for calm nights.
