Seems to me that if you install the cover so it opens from the inside, it wold be pretty hard to lose...

Hi All,

Im getting ready for the 2006 sailing season and have a few questions for those of you who have installed the transom ventilation port. I did not install it for the fear of losing the cover and taking on water. Ventilation has not been a big problem for me, but in my opinion, you can never have to much ventilation, especially here in the south with the heat.

1) Has anybody had any trouble with the port? Losing the cover? putting the cover on in rough weather? (Hanging over the transom)

2) Is there a significant differance in air flow with the cover off vs on?

3) Any opinions on the subject?

Best Regards
