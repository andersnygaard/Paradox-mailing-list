Hello Steve,

thanks for the nice comment but you do know that everything looks so much better on pictures than in real !!
Believe it or not but the small diameter drum shaft was done on purpose.The idea is to wrap a few yards of extra line around the shaft.That extra length of line doesn't need to be stowed away in the allready cramped space of the cabin.
The drum side plates are larger diameter than what is shown for on the Paradox plans also.
I hope to test the reefing system soon to see if my fantasy matches reality.

regards
