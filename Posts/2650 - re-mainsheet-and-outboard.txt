Subject: Re: Mainsheet and outboard

Hi Dave.

I notice that the main sheet on LITTLE CRUISER leans towards the bow as the 
sail's centre of effort, due to a centreboard, is just forward of amidships 
whereas PARADOX leans rear because of not having a centreboard,  which puts 
the sail's centre of effort aft of amidships.(does that make sense?)

If PARADOX had a skeg added aft, as some have discussed, it would push the sail even further rearwards due to the centre of lateral resistance moving further aft.

This because of the relationship of the centre of effort over lateral resistance with a bit of centre of buoyancy thrown in for luck.
All these thing will effect the placement of bulkheads and construction due to where to place the mast.

Adding weight aft like an outboard motor will have the boat trimming down by the stern so ballast will have to be moved forward or more added to get the boat trimmed to her lines. This is very important.

Builders that ignore this could find their boat having some serious handling problems like not being able to tack and getting caught in stays when going about.

Change of subject.

Dave. In your photos of LITTLE CRUISER there is a pipe coming from on deck and going to the outboard.
Is this just a standard fuel line from a tank with a squeezy bulb allowing the motor to draw the fuel its self as needed or some other way for refueling the motor?
