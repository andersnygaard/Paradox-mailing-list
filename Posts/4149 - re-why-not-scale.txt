Hi Jeff,

I like the size as per the plans and I like some of the mods that have actually been made by Paradox owners. There seems, however, to be a common theme throughout this list that a 15% increase is not enough, so I have being doing a bit of research and hopefully adding some useful comments to the dialog.

I would be interested in seeing a finished Paradox first hand, but I am not aware of any on the west coast of North America. Florida and UK are a bit of a drive from my location. :-)

Cheers
George
