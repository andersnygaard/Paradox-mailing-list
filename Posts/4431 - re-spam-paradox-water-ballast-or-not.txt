That was my problem at one time, but then I built a similar tool, but they still leaked unless liberally coated with Vaseline. My problem now is that the cylindrical threaded bit of the lid has parted from the disc. This is the second time this has happened. I can take a hint.

Fortunately my trailer is sturdy enough to carry the extra load, so it should make launching and recovery that bit quicker.

Hoping for calm nights
