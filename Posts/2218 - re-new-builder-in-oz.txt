You had me worried for a minute. I have just cut all my bulkheads and did everything in millimetres. I've checked my plans again and they're metric! Does anybody know how many completed Paradoxes their are around the world and how many in construction in England?

Just wondering how you are getting on with Australian metric plywood and US Paradox plans in Imperial measure. That is, how are you doing fitting inches and feet into cms and metres?

p.s. I have a set of Paradox plans and live in Canberra.
