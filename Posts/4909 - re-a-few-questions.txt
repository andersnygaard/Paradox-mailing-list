Hi Pete.

The floor mats at Maplin's won't be there long as they don't know if any more will be coming in when the present stock runs out. I bought the camping mats for NOLI from Screwfix at under =A33 each. They also sell a foil backed version as well for about the same price, so I bought a few for under the deck with the foil showing.

My local cheap store sell a 3 LED press light for a =A31 which should work well on your boat.

Maplins also sell an AA battery solar charger for =A36.99 which I bought. It will charge other sizes as well. It took 6 hours to charge from flat 4 2600 ml amps AA's.

7dayshop.com do some good cheap rechargeable batteries. 4X2500ml amps for about =A33.50, and some useful camping gear.

I am at present looking for a good solar garden light that I could stick on to of my mast. Fit and forget.

Anyone any thoughts?
