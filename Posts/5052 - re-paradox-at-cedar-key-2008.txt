Glen, sorry to hear that you won't be coming, but at least we got to sail together last year. I must say that I was really hoping to see your fantastic windvane in action, but that will have to wait for the future. David plans to bring Whisper to the event so at least we'll have one Paradox there. Well, send my best to Nancy.
