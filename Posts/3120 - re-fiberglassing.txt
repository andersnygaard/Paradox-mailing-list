Hi Phil,

Depending on how you plan to use the boat during "testing", and depending on the type and quality of the plywood used. If you were to use lets say exterior fir, and you just resin coat 3 coats. 3 coats are going to be the minimum because that will generally guarantee that you have sealed the wood. gonna be a bit of waste here as you are going to sheath her later and that will be more epoxy, not a huge boat so its not that bad. another thing I would look out for is checking, thats when the outter lamination of the plywood splits. When this happens it will alow moisture to enter the plywood. I have covered my Paradox in 2 layers of 2 oz just for this reason. If you use a good marine rated plywood, checking is not so much of an issue. my opinion is you can do this, but its also my opinion to take that 2-3 days and at least fabric it and fill the weave and you can do all the labor of fairing and painting later. I think the most important part is that the bottom and chines are protected from abrasion and not all the Paradoxes are sheathed in fabric anyway. Good luck with your Paradox Phil!!!!
