There is no reason why your sail cannot be stowed when supported by a splayed topping lift as I occasionally do with 'Faith'.

To see a photo showing the sail stowed in this way go to the Photos section; at the first page choose 'Faith', then the second photo.  This is a photo of Al beside my boat when she was at Exmouth while on her South Coast Cruise to the Scilly Isles.
