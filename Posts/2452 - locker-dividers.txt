Subject: Locker dividers

This afternoon I had a revelation. A moment of divine inspiration.

I was replacing the dividers in the rear locker. These are fairly conventional, one fore and aft approximately down the centreline and a few athwart ship to divide the space up for the various buckets, boxes, fenders etc that have accumulated there. These dividers are all nominally upright, It never occurred to me that they should be anything different.

But now I know better. The floor of this locker space curves up towards the transom. A box will not sit sensibly on the floor resting against the divider because the angle is less than 90 degrees, so heavy chain in a plastic bucket eventually punches out the bottom of the bucket. The solution ..... fit the dividers square to the bottom. not only will boxes stack neatly but it will be easier to reach over the divider as it will be leaning towards you. 

All I have to do is take everything out again ......


Hoping for calm nights
