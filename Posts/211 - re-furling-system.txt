Hi David, 

I forgot to mention in my last post that it is important to make sure the sail furls on the side of the boom away from the mast. That way the furling line exits the drum on the outboard side and has a fair lead to the thimble. I didn't have the proper size thimble for mine so I modified a nylon bulls eye fair lead and drilled and tapped the axle to take it. I really don't think it is much more friction free then the brass thimble though. I thought mine had to much friction also until I tried the topping lift. I feel that is where the real problem lies.

As for the bottom glassing, unless you do hard groundings a lot, you should be fine with what is on your interim boat but do a heavy lay-up on your keeper. You are in the fortunate position of having a boat to sail as you build one just like it. You will be able to incorporate those things you find you need.
