Hi DC.

The downside of building the lead into the chine runners would be you could not lighten the boat as easily as the removeable internal ballast plus you would have to have a large melting pot just to do one side.

If one is going to make a pattern for each runner you might as well glue the pattern in place and have done with it.

I have thought of doing away with the plywood extending past the hull sides and shaping the runners to be flush with the bottom.
If the extra timber made it more difficult to bend then just make a few saw cuts on the inside of the runners.
