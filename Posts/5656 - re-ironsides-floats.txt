Congratulations Steve,

Watching your build and successful launch has been a great inspiration to us wanna be builders and your launch site is a wonderful place. 

Many years ago I built and sailed a 3meter trimaran from Manchester around Blake island and back. A great sailing area. I live in the Portland area and have had the plans for years, now that I am retired maybe I can get one built. 

I will be watching the Columbia 150 from the shore. Hope to see you there.
