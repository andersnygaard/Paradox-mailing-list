Now there is a good question.
I never thought to check and the sail is in my cellar which is unaccessible at the moment.
I had my sail made by a reputable firm, Jekylls of Wroxham, and he had seen the Paradox 
on the web. I sent him all the information supplied by Matt so I hope it has luff tape. I'll try 
and get a look over the weekend and let you know the size.
Off to the Beale Park Boat show tomorrow with a mate, and the wife has agreed to drive. 
Heaven!!
