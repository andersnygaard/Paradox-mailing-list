Subject: Starting a Paradox in Ithaca

Hey everybody, 

I'm a long-time lurker who has finally started to build. I'm writing to let you all know that I'll be keeping a (hopefully detailed) build log at http://www.math.cornell.edu/~noonan/boats/paradox.html

If you are curious, you can also see a little blurb about the other boats I've built at http://www.math.cornell.edu/~noonan/boats: two Yost-designed folding kayaks and a PDRacer -- not nearly as complex as Paradox! 

I'm moving to a house on Cayuga Lake this fall, so I've got to round out the fleet with a microcruiser. Not much room to build at the lakehouse, so this summer is a bit of a race to get as much building done as possible. My two brothers will be joining me in July to help things along.

I'm sure I'll have a thousand questions as this build comes along, so thanks in advance for letting me pick your brains.

Matt
