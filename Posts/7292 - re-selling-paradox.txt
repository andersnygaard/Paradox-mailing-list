Subject: Re: Selling Paradox

My wife and I are planning on an extended trip to Panama, Lord willing. We will be driving, pulling a trailerable large enough to live in and sail there and take a Bolger sailing canoe. The Paradox, an excellent boat, just won't work for those plans. I really like the Paradox, if I could swing it, I'd take it. If she doesn't sell, she'll wait for me out back........
