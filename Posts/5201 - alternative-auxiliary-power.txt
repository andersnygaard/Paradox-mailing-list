Subject: Alternative auxiliary power...

Hi,

If you grab almost any can of food, say baked-beans, you will read that there are let's say 2000kj of energy in there, or about 500 food calories. If you then do a conversion or two, you can workout that's about the same as 500watt-hours. 

If Al's outboard uses 15amps @ 12volts =3D180watts, it will go about 2.7 hours on the amount of energy in the baked-bean can, and doing 2knots. The average human can probably do about the same speed in a boat this size, by rowing, sculling, or using a yuloh. 

Since it is known that Mr Average can comfortably produce 100watts output power, he should be able to keep going for at least the same time on the same can of food, and in theory about 5 hours! 'Food for thought' eh?

The human body is actually quite efficient, and you have to have it with you anyway...

Cheers,
Alan.

BTW Chocolate has more than 5 times the calories of baked-beans, so if your 'fuel-tank' space is small, take chocolate!
