You have a nice site man... I created my beam jigs based on what I saw on your site... it was much easier than what is in the manual. Thanks.

Hello Friends 

In Photos, Cachivache folder, upload new images with the progress of the boat. It cut the sides and place to go imagining. 

Thanks to all that help from the forum.
