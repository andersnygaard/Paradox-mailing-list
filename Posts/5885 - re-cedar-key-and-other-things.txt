Subject: Re: Cedar Key and other things

I am stuck in the land of frost. Where the water doesn't flow, and trees and the antelope don't sing. Haha -> Colorado!

I am moving very soon to Texas and will continue my build there.

I have already sent $16.00 via Paypal to the Elliott family for the "Building Manual" and have not received any response of any kind, and that is why I need to get a hold of them.
