Subject: starting to lay out

After spending about 1200A.D. in plans from other designer's, I have decided to build Paradox,plans that I purchased 3 years ago, God I could have been sailing by now. Well at least I know If I ever decide to have a custom boat designed, I know who I would, and would not have do it. 

Paradox plans are as complete as any plans that I have purchased, Really more so. At least I understand them, without a lot of books. Also, I come to my senses and realized, I need nothing bigger, or smaller than Paradox, now I have to play catch up. 

Cheers, 
Rich.
