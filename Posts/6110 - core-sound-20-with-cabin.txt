Subject: Core Sound 20 with cabin

Jeffery,

I'd like to see some pictures of the cabin on you CS20. I like the CS17 and was wondering if one could build a cabin on it. The Belhaven 19 is a nice boat, but just more boat than I want, being mostly interested in single handling. If you have any could you send them or give me a link to them.

Thanks, Rick
