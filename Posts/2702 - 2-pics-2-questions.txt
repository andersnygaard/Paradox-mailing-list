Subject: 2 pics 2 questions

Hi all,

I've uploaded 2 pics in the files section, Paraplastic (SpringFever1,2).
Such a fine day. Took her out to breath spring air. (Also because I wanted to check if the hole for the mast was OK). There is a slight slope towards the meadow. Overestimating my strength, the first launch almost ended in the Sea of Dandelions.

Now the questions
1. To those of you who has installed a solar panel. How do you solve the cable entrance problem? I see that Glen has the loop outside. Have you drilled a hole through the window? Anyone with the loop inside? How?
2. I gather that Matt's drawing of the mast head displays a view from above. The hole through the deck for the halyard is aft of the mast. Which makes the halyard twisting 1/4 turn around the mast. Why? Or have I gotten something wrong?

I also weighed her. With "everything" except mast, boom and yard (and battery etc), but including the 70 kg bronze bottom plate she was 326 kg. Sounds much considering what you guys have said. On the other hand, the paraplastic displaces perhaps 100 extra kg due to the thickness of the divinycell. Any comments?
