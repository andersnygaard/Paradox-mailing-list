Subject: Re: A question about build time vs the Enigma.

Paradox hull is basically chine log construction while Enigma is stitch and glue. Not having built a boat myself, yet, I don't know if one method is inherently faster than the other. Supporting and attaching the deck is essentially the same on both.

Paradox is much more heavily constructed than Enigma: thicker hull plywood, heavy duty bulkheads, longitudinal stringers and essentially a double bottom. I would think this beefing up of the bottom and interior water tanks, would add to construction time of Paradox along with the other interior woodwork such as shelving. For example, Paradox bulkheads are built up from individual timber; Enigma's 2 bulkheads are just pieces of plywood cut to fit.

I want to build the Enigma 460 when the plans are available, due to the lighter overall weight and the quicker build time.
