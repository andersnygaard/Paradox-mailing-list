Subject: tack strop using Harbor freight bender
Date: Mon, 12 Jul 2021 12:59:17 -0700

Hello,

I added a photo of a tack strop I just bent up to photos, in an album called Paul's tack strop, based on another design posted here in the past, that was constructed of 3/8 stainless steel. This is 1/2 inch silicon bronze rod. Figured I should make something since I have the plans.

I drew plans in cad, printed out templates, wrote up a bending procedure, and of course first time using bender, nothing matched the templates. I was more curious if the rod was going to crack on the 1" die as I've never worked with bronze but no issue at all.

Once I cut the excess, I'll order some of the metal for the surrounding pieces, and see how it goes.
