Subject: Re: Building Paradox manual by Don Elliott - how to order?

If you are interested in making it more simple than Paradox, but not too simple, why not scale down the Paradox design a bit and try an Enigma-like chine runner sharpie? 

I thought of doing all sorts of other things, but since this will be my first real build as well, I figure there's nothing like sticking to the Paradox plan. 

I am going to take liberties with a few things, mostly electrical which doesn't have to do with the overall concept. Nothing too far outside the box this first time! With all the wealth of resources on building Paradox, I don't see why I can't leap ahead and try the design. She's proven, and many good sailors seem to swear by her.
