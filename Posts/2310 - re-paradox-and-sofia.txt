Paul,

I would suggest that you take a serious look at increasing the dimensions of the PARADOX plans. They are in metric and it would not be that difficult.

You could probably recover the cost of building, by selling the enlarged plans. Check with Dave and Matt, but I am sure something could be arranged.

Cheers, Nels
