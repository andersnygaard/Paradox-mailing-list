Nels,
I did not ask Matt that question and he never stops.....
My guess is that he literally has a kayak spray skirt that allows him to paddle...just like a kayak?  Otherwise why go to the trouble to do the kayak opening if you are just going to cover it? 
He has an oar strapped to the boat that is long enough to reach the
water?  I did not see anything on the boat to attach or brace to allow
him to skull.  Still a mystery.

I chickened out and can list excuses.  The boat worked well....I did not.
 The first day in the Gulf, was close to the edge for an hour or two.  A
small steering error could put you in that 50 something degree cold
water.  Steering down wind in those conditions is like running bare foot
on a stack of boards with nails in them...for hours.  One miss step and
you get hurt or rather wet in this case.  Exhausting for an old man.  It
was fun for a while but built to scary at some point.

Hi Krank,

Did you ever get the chance to see Illusion buttoned up for the night? Interested in what kind of topper he uses when it rains or gets stormy. Looks maybe like a snap-over the rim spray skirt might work - something like on a kayak?

That was a pretty tough run this year - I was getting kind of concerned about you for awhile there.

Nels,
It looks like Matt will have a good West wind until Sun. night and some times strong. Notice that his course will be as far to the lee (East) of land or rather foliage that will mess up his wind. The paddle boats will hug the foliage unless the wind gets behind them. This wind will help him a lot and not hurt the kayakers much.
The strong gusts between the foliage will knock him down but he is use to that by now. It is a tender little boat. but inherently safe.

Unbelievably Matt aka Wizard is keeping ahead of two very experienced Kayak paddlers, in his tiny 9 ft. Illusion, in the around Florida challenge.

His is traveling inside the ICW so not getting much wind. Latest update this morning posted by his wife I think.

One comment was that Enigma looks big compared to Illusion and you don't climb into Illusion as much as pull it on:-)
