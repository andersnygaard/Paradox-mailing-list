The plan is correct, except there isn't an instruction to the fact that the hole in the shaft for the pin should be made so that there is sufficient twist to get the end of the blade about 50 to 60 degrees from the horizontal at the end of each stroke.  Also Al found it better to have the hole 5.25 inches further towards the handle end of the shaft which gives more power; it allows the yuloh to be used in a more upright mode.  I have made this modification which helps a lot when using the yuloh.

Bill.
