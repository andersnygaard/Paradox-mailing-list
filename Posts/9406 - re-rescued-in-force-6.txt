Hi,

I'm interested in the idea of a sea anchor, has anyone set a sea anchor, I anger, on a Paradox

And in my humble opinion the chine runners are ok and the limiting factor is the slap on the bottom of the hull, a flat-bottomed boat gets slapped going into wind into waves.

I've buried my bow with extra ballast to try and minimise the slapping that slows me, and will anchor up or beach if confronted by unfavourable wind.

In protected waters it's no problem, I've tacked up a narrow river with great success.
