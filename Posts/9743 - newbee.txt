Hello all,

I have the plans, I have the build book, I have the workshop, and I have a ton of questions. I have never built a boat before, never done fiberglass before but with time and patience I hope to do both.

Questions:

- Is a paradox to small to be out on a big body of water? (lake Ontario)
- Am I wrong for wanting to junk rig this boat?
- Are there any paradox sailboats or owners in Ontario?

Thanks,

Steve Bowman
