Hello Matt.

I've recently jumped upon the Paradox wagon. I have a keen interest upon sharpies, but the small boat really triggered me.
Just one question. Blame it on my lack of familiarity & haw to navigate through the paradox web place!

Where did you get the plans for "the boat"?

Many thanks,

I am sending you 2 images of a sharpie model I as still building...

Errm... it's a bit small though. Sorry. 1/15 scale

(Does that link work? See new photo in new 'Scale models' album in group.)

I hope to start a bigger Paradox this year, but I just couldn't decide on the colour, you see, so a scale model is in order. :-D (That and I couldn't sleep the other night.)
