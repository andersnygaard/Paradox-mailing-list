I tried to wrap the sail on the boom this evening and found that the luff won't sit up close to the drum. As I roll the sail around the boom the luff tries to climb over the drum.

Looking at this picture of Zero:

With the sail raised the luff sits a fair way back along the boom when compared with Zoe:

which, I believe, has a Mk1 sail.

Should the tack of the sail be in line with the mast, as it is in both of these pictures, for a lug rig? I ask because I guess that with Mk2 sail my tack strop dimensions are going to be different to the plans.

When the luff is completely rolled there is a large triangle flap of sail 'left over' as I was expecting. I haven't cut any taper on my boom as yet because there are no dimensions applicable to the Mk2 sail that I am aware of. Am I right in thinking that removal of timber from the boom to create a taper is going to give me a bigger flap of sail 'left over'.
