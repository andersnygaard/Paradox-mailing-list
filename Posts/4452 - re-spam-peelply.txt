Subject: Re: [SPAM] Peelply

Hi John,

Its basically Dacron fabric, if you buy it as "Peel Ply" you will pay a premium for it. A good cheap source is from home built airplane suppliers, Wicks, Aircraft Spruce &amp; Specialty etc. as covering fabric, get the lightest weight cloth they have, generally sailplane fabric. I have also had good results with Dacron dress lining material from the local fabric supply houses. It works as AL pointed out  because nothing wants to stick to it, even paint.
