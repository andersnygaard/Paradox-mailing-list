The PDF is AWESOME!!!!!!!

I'm also thinking that since Gorfnik is actually a PDR, the 'PuddleDuck' yahoo group site would love to have this series of posts, pictures, and files on their group site.

If you do any editing, please change the Tenacious Turtle's builder to Jason Nabors. Jason is a living legend.

Looking forward to the final draft.

Respectfully,
Bobby
