Subject: Mast construction how to cut taper and thickness?
Date: Sun, 18 Apr 2021 10:06:40 -0700

Hello Paradox Sailboat group,

I spent yesterday reading through the archives on mast construction and came across a picture of Matt cutting the mast for Enigma with a circular saw. Is there an easy way to cut the mast using only this tool?

I saw someone mention that "side blanks are not only shaped fore and aft, but also tapered in thickness." This applies to the front and rear planks as well. My plans were sent out Oct 08, 2003, and I received Don's building manual around that time too. However, I'm not sure if there has been any updates since then. I recall someone mentioning a reference to page numbers and an appendix, but I couldn't find a section on mast-building. Could anyone provide me with a link or information on how to cut a mast like this?

Thank you,
Paul
