I will look for the Monroe you are speaking of on the web. Having once owned a Drascombe Lugger, I myself never gave much thought to a small sharpie off shore. But they do seem easier to build. I was looking at Nancy s China, Glen L 17, Glen L Minuet, etc.  I like the idea of small and able to get out of a knock down fairly easily.

I think its more Monroe's sharpie that is the inspiration for the paradox.

I am building a stitch and glue sharpie with chine runners, inspired by Matt's designs. I had some ideas that I wanted to try out and decided to design a boat on my own. If you want a boat quickly and with assurance that it will work well, follow the plans. If you have done some boat design and built a few boats, it might be fun to design your own.
