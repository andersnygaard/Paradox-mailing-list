Make sure you get the sides parallel or it will all seize up.

They are 1m out!  I'm hoping that will not be a problem.

Are you fitting a window in the hatch? I have found mine very useful when sailing from inside as otherwise you can't see the sail easily. I assembled the hatch without the window and then cut out the window aperture afterwards. I was worried that the ply would bend crooked if the aperture was cut first

I started the hatch today by attaching the sides.  Tomorrow I have to do the bending + 25% and glassing both sides.  I just hope I worked out the measurement for the curve right.

My runners are not exactly like those drawn by Matt, but not far out.  I made them from the teak scraps I bought at the Beale Boat Show from Robbins of Bristol.  I expect you remember me showing them to you when I had a go in your 'Little Jim'.  You'll certainly not forget your anxiety when I was trying to sail your boat and made a hash of it.  Anyway, I enjoyed your demonstration of how it should be done.

No anxiety, there was nothing on that lake that could have damaged a Paradox. :-)  You can be very relaxed when you know you have the toughest boat in the area.

Anyway, it is easy really, you just need somewhere with less edge so you can get a propper run at it. (a smaller audience helps too).

Hoping for calm nights
