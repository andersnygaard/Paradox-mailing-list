I had previously noted that Little Jim could not be sailed with the rudder all the way up. When the main sheet is pulled in the boat just turns into the wind. With the rudder raised to the horizontal it works fine.

I had also noted that it was easier to tack to starboard than to port and we sometimes got stuck and had to bear off onto the starboard tack again.

At one point during our trip on Saturday we were in the channel heading SE into a SE wind (F3-4?) with 2 or 3 knots of tide with us. The surface was therefore quite disturbed. When I lowered the sail, later, the tide just had more push than the wind. 

As we were approaching some moored yachts I decided to tack away and put the helm over. We came into the wind and stuck there. So I went to fall off onto the starboard tack again but found I couldn't, the rudder had no effect, in fact it behaved just as if the blade was raised. I even had a look to see if the blade had fallen off!

As we were drifting down with the tide onto the moorings I lowered the sail and sculled clear. When I hoist sail a little later everything was back to normal.

Any bright ideas as to what may have been going on?
