Hi,

I've uploaded a few photos to the photo gallery. I have more, just not on this PC.

Someone said in an earlier thread that it's ok to give the boat a name once it's gone 3D, so the boat's name is: *Miramis

Miramis* is the name of Mio's flying horse in the 1950's fantasy novel Mio, my son by Astrid Lindgren.
