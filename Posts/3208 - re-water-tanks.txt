I made enquiries from my epoxy supplier who recommended that I didn't use it for drinking water. So I use the water as ballast, but I don't drink it. Never mind the epoxy the sludge (slime) that was left in the bottom of the tank at the end of the first season confirmed my decision. If launching from a remote site I will now often fill with sea-water.

Unless you are intending to set out on extended trips to remote areas there is plenty of storage space for a few bottles of water.

Some people have done away with the tanks altogether, fitted extra permanent lead and used the space as a storage locker (for water bottles?)
