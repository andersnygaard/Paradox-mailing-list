Hello Paradoxians.

I wanted to cite the youtube video by Eerik Mee, who says:

"I share my experience on casting lead ballast pigs for my Paradox sailboat, using drywall panel molds, glued together with hot melt glue, berried in the ground and backed with soil. The quickest and easiest (and cheapest) way of making molds I could think of. I couldn't find any information that it has been done before, so it was an experiment. Successful at that. It took place between seasons 1 and 2."
