Dear Bill Longyard,

As the distinguished author of the group,

Improbable Vessels

would you be at all interested in contributing to a Paradoxbuilders
build manual? It is important to me that our manual exhibit an
unbiased, concise and factual account of the method of constructing an
"as designed" example of Paradox. If the group were to begin compiling
the necessary data and produce a fairly clean copy of each phase of
construction, would you be interested in exercising your talents to
make sure we're on track? 

If you are hesitant to jump into this kettle, I understand. I am
committed to putting together a decent manual, and will offer my
services in any way the group sees fit. I for one would welcome your
participation.

Respectfully,
DC
