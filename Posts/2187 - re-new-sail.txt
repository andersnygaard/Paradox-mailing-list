Subject: Re: New Sail

I think I would just go with the latest revision since it has already been tested.  Who knows?  The new one may be better or it may be worse... For now I would just go with a sail from Glen's sailmaker. On the other hand, if you are making the sail yourself then it might be a fun experiment to try if you've already got one "good" sail.  By the way, we're hoping to another sail for Little Cruiser,and it will include some modification; however, greater draft isn't one of them.  The changes include an increase to 5 oz sailcloth, a shorter top batten and a tighter leach tabling.
