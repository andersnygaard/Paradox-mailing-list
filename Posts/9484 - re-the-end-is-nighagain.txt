I think we should move this shebang to Groups.io.

The email-list arrangement is good, and worth keeping.

What about the rest of you?

How to go about it? One of the mods needs to read this:

https://groups.io/g/GroupManagersForum/wiki/Transfer-from-Yahoo-Groups

...and set up a login with mod/admin access which Groups.io uses as an agent to transfer everything.

Present mods; does one of you want to own the new group? I don't mind taking it on and setting it all up if no one else wants to. I figure it's polite to get permission from present mods before doing that. :-)

Thanks,

Matt
