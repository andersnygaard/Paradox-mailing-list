Welcome aboard. Feel free to pick our brains about anything that is unclear during the build.

Where abouts are you based? If you are within striking distance of Yeovil you are welcome to come and crawl over Little Jim if it will be any help.

Was that you we spoke to outside Helford?

Hoping for calm nights

Al
Yeovil, England.
