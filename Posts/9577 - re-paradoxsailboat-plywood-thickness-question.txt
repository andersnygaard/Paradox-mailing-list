Hi,

Mine is built to plan. The hardest bits were the thickest plywood, bending the bottom of the hull was hard. If I ever did this again, I would use two layers of thinner wood on the bottom of the hull. The chines inside the hull were hard to bend too. I pre-bent them before inserting them; they are the long bits of wood at the corners of the bulkheads that run full length. Mine were Oregon and very stiff.

The weight of the boat is an advantage. It needs to be buried in the water. It has no keel. The heavier mine is, the easier it is to steer.

Ballast is a must. If you just have cans, you will need a lot of them. They will move around and need to be filled with sand and rock when empty, or you will get lighter and lighter as the days go by. I have only done five-day cruises in mine and I eat little. The water tank and the copper base plate are different on mine. I have a plastic custom-made tank I can clean. An epoxy/ply tank is not a good idea; they can leak and epoxy in your water? Not a good thing for the water?

The lightning rod and copper plate are not needed here in Australia, so I left that out, otherwise it's a standard hull.

Pre-bending the chime logs on my house. Looking into the hull from the port bow, chines can be seen at the top, and a tiny bit of the bottom chine can be seen ahead of the lead ballast weight.

Thank you.
