Subject: Videos - Paradox Scout completes 5 day Texas 200

Hey gang,

I've been MIA for a while but Scout and I have returned home to AZ from Texas where we sailed in the Texas 200. This was a great event with ALL kinds of conditions from 30+ knots to light air. On day one some of the puddle ducks that were sailing the event got in trouble in high winds and a good size swell, breaking rudders and masts. Scout and I were able to hook up to one in about 20-25 knots...and tow him about 20 miles to a beach where we met others and we were able to get all the boats fixed on the spot and continue on. The trip covered around 200 miles over 5 days of sailing. Max wind I saw was 34 apparent measured on my mast top annemometer. I felt that Scout performed great. This was a test for me to see if I might be interested in trying an EC Challenge. I'd say it went pretty well and there is a good possibility that I may attempt the 2016 EC...but that is still a long ways off.

One thing I want to tell you.....If you are building a Paradox....IT IS GONNA BE WORTH IT!!! :-)

Videos

I have been busy editing all the video I took on the trip. I have 3 days worth posted and day 4 will go up in about an hour if the upload goes well. If you want to check them out you can go to my youtube channel and click on the "paradox" play list. All the T-200 videos are at the top. There are a few others also of Scout that were taken my other sailors and shared. One shows me waiting to come into Camp 1 for the last duck to arrive so I turned around and sailed upwind against 30+ and a tidal current. We didn't go upwind smoking fast...but we went upwind which is pretty dang good in those conditions!

Here is the address to the Youtube Channel Playlist. I will get Day 5 uploaded in a day or so. Enjoy!
