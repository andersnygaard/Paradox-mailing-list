I have found the yuloh to be excellent as a power source when the wind drops, but if there is wind blowing it is hard work to travel in any direction except downwind. This is because, with the thrust so far back, it is difficult to stop the bows blowing off. It is alright for manoeuvring in a marina, but any long distance windward work would soon tire you.

hi 
i too would like to use a paradox to get around the uk canal and river system but without a motor on the end
so why can't a yuloh be used all day,given that you would have to stop quite often in the canal system to lock in and out?
also there is the alternative of pulling the boat along the towpath as was done in days of old.by the way does anyone know the method ie rudder and rope control? given the speed limit 4 mph both ways should be easy to do,i hope martin
