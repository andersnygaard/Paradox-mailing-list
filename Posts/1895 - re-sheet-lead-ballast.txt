It says on sheet 5 of the plans "Ballast - 70-180 kg lead pigs ....." 
This is not because Matt thinks that you may build the hull 110kg 
(240lb) over weight, but because you have to remove ballast as you 
add stores, therefore some of the lead must be easily removable.

Before I launched my Paradox I had weighed it and calculated the 
extra ballast needed. It was not until after the fourth outing that I 
was finally satisfied that I had it in the right place to get the fore/aft 
trim right. Then I sorted out the bolting down. It didn't need to be far 
out to make the tacking much less certain.

With a sheet of lead you would have to be very confident you had 
done the balance sums right!

SUBJECT: [paradoxbuilders] Sheet Lead Ballast

I am currently in the very early stages of construction of my PARADOX.
Presently I am building a 1 to 5 scale model of the boat which I find
helps greatly when it comes to building the real thing.

A question to the group concerning Lead Ballast. I am not keen on
having lead pigs cleated down inside the boat and was considering
laminating sheet lead (used in building constuction here) between  a
12mm and a 6mm ply sheets which would make up the 18mm ply bottom
sheet. I have not yet done the calculations to see if the sheet lead
will supply all the required ballest. The technical people at West
Systems assure me that I will have no trouble obtaing a bond between
lead and ply.

I would welcome comment for and against the idea.
