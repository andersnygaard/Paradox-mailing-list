Hi all,

I have just posted 4 pictures to Photos: So-So that show the current state of my Paradox 
build.

Keen eyed observers and readers of Don's Build Book will see that I have deviated from the 
text. I have had so much trouble getting the shape of the stem right and then pulling the 
bow in to meet it that I have given up on that stage of the build for a bit. I wasn't making 
progress so I decided to assemble bulkheads 2, 3 and 4 into a square box using the floor 
panels and temporary bin sides. I checked the diagonals to confirm squareness and then 
glued, cramped and nailed the sides to those 3 bulkheads. That is the stage that the 
photos show.

Checking this morning I find that the diagonals between 2 and 3 and 3 and 4 are within 
2mm of each other which seems close enough. 

To the starboard of the boat will be seen my most important work tool: a green stool. 
Upon this noble seat I sit and ponder, pontificate or procrastinate as the need takes me. It 
is mounted on a trolley with 4 castors which means I can do these things either backwards 
and forwards or side to side. If I stand up and sit down again I can do the 3 P's in 3 
Dimensions.

If accompanied by a coffee and a cluch of Garibaldi biscuits all decision making seems to 
turn out ok in the end. I find that Tamla Motown, Stax Soul or Van Morrison are also good 
aids to the working process. Not all our tools need be razor sharp!

Any messages of support gladly received. I'm now off to fit bulkhead 1 and finish the 
transom. Then the problem of the stem becomes unavoidable.

Best wishes,
Derek
