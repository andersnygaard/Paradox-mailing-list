Subject: Lower rudder pintle
Date: Wed, 05 Aug 2009 19:44:34 -0000

On Sunday I noticed that my lower rudder pintle has some play, several degrees in any direction.  I took everything off.  The rudder head has been sitting in a warm, dry room fro three days now, and there is still some moisture around the pintle.  I think that means water has seeped into the plywood and is slowly coming out now.

How do I fix this?  And does anyone have any idea why it happened in the first place?  It is not at all a problem I expected.

I'll take a picture as soon as I have recharged the batteries for my camera.
