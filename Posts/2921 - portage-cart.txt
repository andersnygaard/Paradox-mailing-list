Subject: Portage Cart

Here's an example of a portage cart. It will support 200+ pounds. What we often do when using one is each carry a pack and leave the grub box and camping stuff in the canoe.

They are popular along the Bowron Lakes route where all the portage trails are maintained with wood chips in the low spots to allow the use of carts.
