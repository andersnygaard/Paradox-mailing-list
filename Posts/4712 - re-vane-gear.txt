Subject: Re: Vane gear

Hi Glen,

Are you around, or have you gone off sailing with your self-steering 
gear?

I've been looking at various windvane gears with a view to adapting 
one to Paradox.  The easiest would be a Vectavane and Mr Vane would 
be another possibility.

Are you completely happy with your gear, and have you been able to 
find time for working on drawings of your windvane system?

While on the topic of self-steering systems, what type of electronic 
gear did you use and was it linked to the tiller or to the steering 
line?

Best wishes,
Bill.
