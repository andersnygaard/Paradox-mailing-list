Your description makes it easier to understand the page 12, but I'm sure I'll still have more questions about it once I get up to it (still stuck on page 7 for now.)

On thing a lot of people have had trouble with is the mast drawing on sheet 12. I believe that there is an error in the form of extra dimension arrows that should not be there.

If you look at the vertical dimensions (500; 900; 900 etc.), immediately to the right is a set of arrow heads pointing right. If you paint these out with correcting fluid the dimensioning is then correct, and it helps to separate the 2 views (side section view to left and half end section view to right).

Hope that makes sense.

Well, it doesn't totally yet, but I'm not up to that page (*sill(on page 7), so my mental powers (meager as they may be :)) aren't completely focused on comprehending page 12.  I'll keep the message for when I do get to page 12.
