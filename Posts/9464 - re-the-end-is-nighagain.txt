I will use a new site when you have found enough time to put it together.

P.S. Thank you for your efforts, Matt

It turns out there's an API I can hit directly with a script. :-)

I've got 80% of the messages downloaded already, and I think the files/photos/etc will be easy too. I have it running with a few seconds delay between requests so it doesn't get blocked.

This will get everything in a database format I can make direct use of, so I'll see what I can cobble together in terms of an archive and forum we can all continue to use.

How many of you are still here, and will use such a thing if I create one?

(It won't happen right away, but I'll at least get a new address figured out before Yahoo shuts down, so I can announce it.)

Matt
