Hello Alberto

The sail has a three dimensional shape.
The method used to create a three dimensional shape from flat sailcloth is called BROADSEAMING.
Broadseaming is varying the width of overlap along the seams joining each panel of the sail between the luff and leech. There is more overlap at each end than in the centre.
I sewed my sail using Matt's instructions which are in the "Files" section under "New sail plan". Note that the measurements of the new sail plan are different from those of the sail shown on drawing number 1 of the plans.
I suggest you also try to find a book on sailmaking and look at a few sails to see how the sailmaker has sewn the various parts of the sail. Matt's instructions are not intended to be a complete guide to making your sail.
Take care if you are working from a translated file.

Hello friends 
At the start of construction Cachivache decided that it was possible to 
craft more, so I would also build the sail. That's why I appeal to the 
friends of the group with a query. The candle is completely flat or 
take any bag or curve in any of their cloths?. 
We thank you very much for all the help that here are giving me to get 
a good construction
