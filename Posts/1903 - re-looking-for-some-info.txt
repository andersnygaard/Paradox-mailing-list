Thanks Guys,

This makes it much clearer, I use west system and will use that. Mostly the freshwater will be for rinsing off salt water after diving, and will be for drinking when on longer cruises after a few tank fulls rinsed thru the "west" odor should vacate. The rest should fall into place. Thanks again.
