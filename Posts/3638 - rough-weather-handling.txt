I am new to this group. I am thinking of building a Paradox next fall/winter, and, having never sailed one, have some questions.

The chine runner design looks ingenious, but what keeps the boat from getting blown off-course when tacking, when neither chine runner is grabbing any water?

Does the lack of flare at the bow make it more prone to pitchpoling when skidding off a crest and into a trough? How does it handle when a wave breaks over the bow?

If the bow becomes submerged in a wave, what is the behavior like while the boat is "submarining"? Does it still steer? Does any water enter through the vents?

How well does it point when lying to a drogue? Does it hunt around and get batted about by the waves, or does it slice through them reliably?

How does it behave when lying ahull to steep waves. There is no keel for it to trip over and capsize, but do the chine runners catch on the water?
