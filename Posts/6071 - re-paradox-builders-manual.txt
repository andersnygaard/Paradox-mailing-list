Lezlie,

The email address for the late Don Elliott (currently used by Wanda - his widow)
has two (2) Ts in it ! ie. donelliott@localnet.com. Use this and you should have no problem.

I made the same mistake before I finally made contact with Wanda.

Regards,

Mike.

I tried the email (donelliot@localnet.com) and the message I got was "no mailbox here by that name." Does anyone know of any other way to get a copy of the Builder's Manual?
