The second part of pictures is set. Holes - even more holes - for ceiling fittings. Again, I drilled them big and filled them with epoxy, and then drilled fixing holes. Next step is mounting insulation plus cover plates. I have also prepared the floor plates for painting, but I will wait until next year to paint them and fasten them properly. There is something special about the side fans, it still works in my head. Next year, the work will continue.
