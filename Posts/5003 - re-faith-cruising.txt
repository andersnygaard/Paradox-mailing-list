Hi Al.

Its all down to the weather.

My first job is to paint the hull in epoxy high-build prior to the final paint job.

I have been quite busy lately with a lot of unwanted drawing work coming in, but still it helps pay the bill's and for the sail which is on order with a sailmaker in Cowes.

Just think that this time last year we were walking around in tee shirts and shorts.

Today.

Bloody hailstones and cold.

Still. I have bought the Perspex for the side and rear windows as "offcuts" which cost me =A36.

They are looking out for a nice bit for the front.

I am still looking to put NOLI in the water late June, early July.

Lets hope the weather sorts itself out soon.



Amen to that. What is the good of not having to go to work if the weather is too poor to go sailing?


Hoping for calm nights
