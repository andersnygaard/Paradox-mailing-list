Yeah, I remember. Sounds like it might be a good idea if you must have an engine. I had lots of good ideas when building Little Jim but eventually decided to build as-designed and then retro-fit my ideas later if I thought it was worth it. So far none of my original ideas have been implemented, mostly because they would mess up some other aspect that I hadn't appreciated while building.

Most of my mods have been minor things like cutting the hatch covers in two to make them easier to get into. The biggest mod is hovering on the horizon, that is to cut the access to the forward stateroom down to the level of the floor. This will lose the useful storage under the forward floor, but should (just) allow my folding bike to be stored there.

I will ponder that a while longer, while getting on with the sailing.
