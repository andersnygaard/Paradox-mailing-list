Subject: Re: Junk rig

Hi Alberto,

No, but I have converted an 18 ft fibreglass production boat to junk rig and plan to have a junk rig on my paradox.  I am sure it will work fine.  There are many different ways to rig a junk rig and I am sure that you can adapt the junk rig to suit this application.

Cheers
