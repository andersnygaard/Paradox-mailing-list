Motors:
I have nothing against them, my background is all motor boats, but on a Paradox I find them unnecessary. I fully intended to fit a motor, but decided that for the first year I would do without, then I would *have* to learn to sail. The second year I somehow never got round to fitting it and the third I realised I didn't need it.
Several Paradox owners have commented how well I manage to get to windward. I have observed them put in a tack or two, then start the engine. They have never had a chance to learn to sail properly.

Motors as a safety device:
I was once in a fleet of dinghies drifting in zero wind down an estuary. We came into close proximity with a ferry. All the boats with oars rowed clear. The one boat with an outboard tried to start it, and failed. By the time he got the oars out it was too late to prevent a collision.

Taking a tow:
I have never *needed* a tow. Sometimes it is convenient, or polite, to take one if offered.
