I suppose if I were doing an ocean passage I would take a spare spacer for the tack arrangement and maybe fit a second halyard on a separate external block.

Drawing 9, middle of sheet, on left-hand side shows the arrangement for the 'brass pipe spacer'.  This is the pipe through which the tack strop passes which prevents the boom from being raised higher than it should when the halyard is hoisted.

I have uploaded a photo of 'Faith's tack arrangement to the Photos section.  When I made the split 'Y' spacer I strengthened it with wooden capping pieces either side, and attached them to the pipe with epoxy sheathing.  After 2 seasons of sailing all is well.

It would be there as a spare, incase the original through-the-mast one failed.  That would mean the sail could be hoisted again without delay.  I appreciate that on a calm day at sea, one could unship the mast and replace the original halyard with a new one.

Bill.
