Subject: Little Cruiser rudder

I've spent quite a bit of time going back over the message archives and I've got a question about the Paradox rudder.  At one point a few years ago it seemed that a few people were of the opinion that the rudder design on Little Cruiser, applied to a Paradox might be an improvement, i.e. that the slightly reduced area might improve tacking performance.  Has anyone tried this out?

It also appears that Little Cruiser uses sets of standard gudgeons and pintles as opposed to the custom molded gudgeon on Paradox.  I'm all for simplicity.  I'd rather use off the shelf gudgeons and pintles unless absolutely necessary.

Thanks,
