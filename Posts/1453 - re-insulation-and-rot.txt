Thanks for the replies.

I've been thinking about closed cell foam of the type used for camping mats. I have used it successfully in motor caravanettes in the past however, I've only seen it in 6mm (quarter inch) thickness so I don't know what, if anything, it will do for buoyancy.

Has anybody used silicone sealant as an adhesive? It seems to work well and can be laid in a thick enough bead to leave an air gap. You'd have to confirm that it didn't react with either surface first. It can also be cut away and replaced easily.
I was told that it was originally developed as an adhesive for space.

Finally, another question. Where does one store wet warps in a Paradox?

Cheers......Derek
