There is one other boat that is very similiar to Paradox.... much bigger 18 feet but has all the other traits except a water supply system that is refreshed by rain. Its call a "Swaggie" by John Welsford. http://www.duckworksbbs.com/plans/jw/swaggie/index.htm

There is also a modified bigger version of paradox drawn out by somebody in this forum and the info is in the files section. Personally rather than alter the paradox design I would seriously look at the Swaggie. I was thinkin of building one in a few years to just up and take off in, no particular port in mind.

Good luck man,
Rod

Pete, I spent alot of time looking thru your build site and really enjoyed all the pics. Its great to see you have gotten so much of it completed. I need to visit your area some day to make the bike trip to the pub, that must have been great everyone ridding back home with a buzz and feeling good. Pete do you have any long distance trips in mind for this boat when your done? Its great to read the stories of others who are able to take there little boats on long trips hope to be reading about your adventures soon.
I need to start building my paradox this year I waited a couple of years hoping someone else would build a larger version of paradox but looks like I will be building her stock and will work on gaining more interior room by reducing my own size, eating better and drinking less beer. Im 6'4 and 260# so you can see my concern on interior size but paradox is such a unique boat and for me it has a feeling no other boat brings so I dont have a choice.
