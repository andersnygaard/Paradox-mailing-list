Hi,

Since there would only need to be about 600mm movement
forward of the sheet attachment point out of a total
boom-length of 3350, then any difference in downward
force should be minimal I think. If I could remember
more of my old applied-maths courses I guess I could calculate it!
Also, I'm not convinced about the bridle having more tension than the 
sheet, and might try a wee scale experiment with rubber-band
measuring devices to try and get my head round this-again I ought to 
know how to calculate it! I think the sheet load should be split into
two vectors, one each way along the bridle from the sheet attach 
point, and each one LESS than the sheet load?

Cheers,
Alan.
