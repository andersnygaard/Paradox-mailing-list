Thanks Nels, the trip was fine and I have a new (1st) grandson. We were able to bail out in time to miss the big snow storm that hit about 3 hrs after we left. Of course we have had to lay up in bed for the last week getting over the colds we caught from the granddaughter.

1. Up wind performance of the new sail is very good and yes Paradox will tack through 90 degrees but with a loss of speed compared to tacking through 100 degrees.

2. You just can't beat those chine runners for doing the job they do relative to the convenience they provide. Try em, you'll like em.
