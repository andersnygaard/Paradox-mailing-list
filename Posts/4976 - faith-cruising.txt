Subject: 'Faith' cruising

I started my cruise aboard 'Faith' five days ago. The log can be seen at http://bills-log.blogspot.com If you can't find it there you can access it through http://wwww.smallsailboats.co.uk

I'll only be able to upload the log when I can use WIFI Hotspots.

I hope you will enjoy reading the blog.

Currently weather bound at Ramsgate - snow is forecast, but I have a Woolworths Hot water bottle - my trump card!

Cheers,
Bill.
