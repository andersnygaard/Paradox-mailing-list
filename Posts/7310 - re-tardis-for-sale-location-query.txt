I have the opportunity to go sailing for an extended period of time.  I have decided to sell TARDIS  rather than have her sit gathering dust while I sail around the world.  If anyone is interested in her, give me a call.  832.859.8416  I will be leaving the first week in Jan, but have someone that can show her if she doesn't sell before I leave.
