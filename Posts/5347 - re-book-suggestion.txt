Yes I'm sure your right there. In the past I have always dreaded a trailer boat launch. However I'm shure a properly designed and equipt trailer would smooth out most of the trouble. I have in the past watched people trying to launch and retrieve there boats. When they are tired or drunk or both they are sad to see. A bad wind makes it worse. When they yell at their helpers I have to look away as it is too awful to see. Let alone offer to help. Tell me Al, do you rig up the mast before you launch? And also how do you tie on the mast while you traveling on the highway? Steve Yahn
