"Little Jim" only arrived after 18 months. But definitely not Yoyo, it gives an entirely untrue impression.

Does 'Little Jim' have anything to do with Spike Milligan, Peter Sellars et al? 'Minnie' is one name on my list as a possibility, but have several others too. Since I've hardly begun building I guess I've got at least 18months too for the eventual name to become set in concrete (epoxy).
