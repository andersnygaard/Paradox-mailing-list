Hi,

I had to play about with the fore/aft position of the lead (I have the as-designed water tanks) but I have never had reason to question the lateral position. 

I too have considered an electric outboard. I would mount the batteries immediately forward of bulkhead 3 embedded in the side locker.

Hoping for calm nights
