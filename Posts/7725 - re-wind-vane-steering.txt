Mike,

I'm sorry to say that at present I am far too busy to revisit the building of the vane gear but all the information you need is on the web. Zoe's gear was a modification of the Walt 2020B. You can find it by going here: http://www.mistervee.com/?q=home you have to register to get to the DIY files. Once registered look on the right-hand pane and find self-build systems and click on Walt Murray's designs. Also, refer to the pictures in the files section. Good luck.
