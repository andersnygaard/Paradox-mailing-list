Hi Glen,

Thanks for your input. The surface area adjustments you made is useful information. 

I did look at the Cape Horn models (even though they almost cost more than a new Paradox!) and am intrigued by the swinging pendulum oar type. It is not clear to me from the photos of your set-up whether your oar swings or is fixed? I was considering building the Model 90-93, Jan Alkema invention---- RHM (Rudder Head Mount) on the Walt Murray website. This model claims to combine the advantages of a trim tab and a pendulum. Do you have any thoughts about the appropriateness of this model for a Paradox or of swinging pendulum style self steering vanes in general based on your experience.

Thanks

Mark
