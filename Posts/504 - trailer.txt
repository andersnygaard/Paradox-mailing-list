As I recall David your trailer was for a boat of about 500 lbs. The Paradox when loaded and ready to go cruising for a week or so is close to 900 lbs. Your frame should be ok if you want to modify it. The steps would be to remove the fenders and get a longer axle and heaver three leaf springs (2000 lbs). Mount the axle on top of the springs as this will lower the trailer. I also had my spindles welded to the top of the axle instead of coming out the ends. Thereby lowering another one and a half inch. After all was done I built extensions for the fenders to get them back out away from the trailer frame and over the tires. This resulted in a loaded height to the bottom of the boat of 14 inches. When you add the 9 inch water line draft you come out just under 2 feet which was my goal.

When I was over at Apalachicola I don't think I could have launched or recovered at low tide because the drop off was so shallow. I think a magic-tilt type trailer would help in such a case but that was not an option I chose, maybe I should have.

The trailer parts can be ordered from Northern Tool & Equipment. A catalog can be ordered by calling 800-556-7885.
