Subject: Re: Enuf's Calamity Update &amp; the Yard

Did you sleeve the entire length of the mast? I had thought of that but I really like the wooden stick look. I had no problem with bare epoxy... I have heard that alot use the petroelum jelly and linseed oil to avoid this. Most of this damage happened when reefed in and in strong wind, so the yard was about 1/3 of the way up. hopefully I will get out this week or weekend to try it out.

I had this chafing problem, and had my sail modified (longer gap in the sleeve) so that it is the spar, not the sail that rubs against the mast. Then I fitted a leather sleeve to the mast - Problem (apparently) solved.

Hi Derek,

One thing to look out for would be chafing against the mast, I know because I had finished my mast in varnish, it created more friction and burned a hole thru my top sail sleeve about 8 inches long. I sewed a leather chafe protector to the top sleeve and Im going to skin the mast and use a petroleum jelly and linseed oil mixture for finish instead of varnish. Bamboo being segmented may pose a problem, unless you can get a segment to fall correctly at the mast. if nothing else it would be noisy as it jumped over the end of the segment.

Wow! You have viewed the yard as a thin piece of wood thickened where necessary and I have seen it as a thick piece of wood thinned down. I never even thought of it your way about.
The plans suggest that it can be made hollow so the weight is obviously not an issue. I'll try the bamboo and beef it up at the point by the mast.

The taper on the yard puts the stiffness where it is required while removing material (weight) where it is not needed.
