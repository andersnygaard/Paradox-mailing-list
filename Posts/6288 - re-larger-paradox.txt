Subject: Re: larger paradox

People have, for years, been thinking they want a larger Paradox but no-one has yet, as far as I know, had the courage to build one. Will you be the first?

Personally I can see few advantages and many disadvantages of a larger Paradox but until someone gets sailing in one it is all just opinion. Here is your opportunity to go down in boating history. Are you up for it?

Hoping for calm nights
