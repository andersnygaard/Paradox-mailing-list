I've pencilled in Poole on the 24th, weather permitting. I see the DCA meet is at Shipstal Point. What is the format for that? I suppose I should send off my DCA application! I also notice in the South Coast DCA calendar that HW is at 11.53, 4.6m. I hope not. I can't find a tide in any of my sources bigger than 2.5m...

Al, I notice that you made the mainstream Yachting press again. Little Jim is in September's Sailing Today (article about DCA).

At the moment I am planning to be at the DCA rally in Poole on the weekend of 24th Sept and at the rally in Plymouth on the weekend of 1st October. After that I think my Brownie points will need a bit of a top up.

Hi Alastair and Pete

Yep, I'm  up for a national Paradox rally. Sometime at the end of September or early October would be grand. I hope that my new trailer will be up and running by then. Where? Poole? the Dart, or the Plymouth area?

Jim
