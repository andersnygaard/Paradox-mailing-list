Subject: paradox plans

I have been reading all postings since I joined in Oct 2007.I would like to start building paradox as this design fits my needs perfectly. I am very interested in purchasing plans but have not gotten any reply to emails to mbolduc@triad.rr.com. Has the email address changed?
