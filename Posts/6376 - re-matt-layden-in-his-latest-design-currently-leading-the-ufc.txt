Hi Krank,

Did you ever get the chance to see Illusion buttoned up for the night?
Interested in what kind of topper he uses when it rains or gets stormy.
Looks maybe like a snap-over the rim spray skirt might work - something
like on a kayak?

That was a pretty tough run this year - I was getting kind of concerned
about you for awhile there.
