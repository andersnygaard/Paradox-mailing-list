In future you could have on board:

download - Lazarus Form Recovery http://getlazarus.com/download It's available for Chrome, Firefox, and Safari. (Sorry, Internet Explorer users.)

download. Lazarus automagically encrypts and saves web-form data as you type, so that when a form submission fails, your browser crashes, or something else goes horribly wrong, you can skip the hair pulling, return to the page you were on, click the Lazarus icon, and recover all your hard work.

Or...

unlikely of to be of use recovering that lost post now as this coming three days on maybe a little late. Sorry if you've shut down your machine in the interim.

However, if you haven't shut down, then even without Lazarus having been installed, and whatever your browser including IE you may still be able to quickly recover your post:
