Subject: Enuf's Bottom

Well the experiments are over and tomorrow I have hired two Williams to strip the bottom.

I decided to simulate catching something sharp in shallow water. I cut a two inch slash, turned the knife blade under it and lifted with some force. The top weaving of the biaxial ripped diagonally right the way across the hull in a two inch strip. The top weave of the biax isn't even bonded to the bottom one. 

Any aggressive crab wanting revenge for all its relatives that I've eaten could totalise the bottom of Enuf in short order.

It is going to strip easily but to avoid lubricating it with my tears the two lads are going to do the job. I'm off to Hay on Wye for a couple of days with the wife. She says I need a rest :0)
