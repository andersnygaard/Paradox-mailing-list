Subject: Re: sail shape

It's not the shape of the spar per se, it's how it bends.
I'm sure Matt mentions this in his sailmaking instructions.
My sailmaker asked me to hang a 10kg weight from the centre of the spar and measure deflection.
In fact this is my reply to his email:

* I've supported the yard at it's extremities and hung a 10kg weight at the very centre. I have measured the deflection at 5 points; Centre andplus and minus 500mm and 1000mm. I'll call these points 1-5, 1 beingnearest the throat, 3 centre and 5 nearest the peak. These are thedeflections:1 = 6mm2 = 16mm3 = 21 mm4 = 20 mm*
*5 = 11 mm *

One thing I'd recommend is keeping weight aloft to a minimum!
