And even on the trolley it's a very heavy boat to juggle :0)

I put my first coat of pigmented resin on today. It doesn't look nice.

The rain is holding me up too.  I managed to bevel the aft end of the bottom piece and I was hoping to do the forward end today, but it'll have to wait until the sun comes out.  Then I'll need at least 4 days to let the epoxy set thoroughly.  Getting the temperature for this out of doors is dependent upon the weather, and doing it in the garage may not be possible.  Even if I was able to do it in the garage, the boat would have to be left outside.  It's all a juggling act.
