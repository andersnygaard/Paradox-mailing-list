Subject: Peque=F1o Launch Success

Brand new Peque=F1o successfully launched yesterday in 20 knot winds. Goes like a charm.

I=92m very pleased with the interior layout. Like in my other Paradox =ABIota=BB, I did not install the internal water tanks. Seems to me to be too much trouble filling and refilling these and too much maintenance to my taste. I prefer permanent ballast so I can launch instantly (takes 8 minutes from trailer to sailing away). Actually, when the ramp is free, I just unhook the single ratchet strap and the winch hook to back straight into the water. It=92s actually easier to set up the mast when the boat is in the water. Also did not put any cubbies on the starboard side in front of the central bulwark. I like to keep this space free for sleeping on the right side of the boat where there is more room for feet.

In Peque=F1o, I ballasted with bricks wedged in with rubber mats. I also installed two additional 16 inch square below-the-floor compartments just in front of the two larger ones on the plan. I find that access to these larger ones is a bit inconvenient in that you have to get off the seat to get into them, whereas my two additional ones are immediately accessible. Of course you have to keep these compartments partially filled with water bottles or canned goods to compensate for loss of ballast, but this is easy and works great.

Also, with bricks instead of water, the boat needs a bit of extra flotation to compensate. Water is neutral ballast, whereas bricks are not. I put one inch foam on every wall and ceiling, and doubled in some places. Also filled most of the forward hatch with foam.

Looking forward to wonderful adventures.

Best,
