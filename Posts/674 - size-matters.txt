So I was greatly inspired by Don Eliot's wonderful drawings and articles. So I bought the plans and pored over them with the fire in the belly to build. Then I realized that I'm 6'4" and the sleeping berth area is only just over 6' long. The sitting headroom seems pretty short, too.

I thought it might be an easy matter to open up the bottom of the hatchway in bulkhead #2 to stick my feet through, and maybe raise the cabin roof a bit, etc. But I know it ain't like letting out a pair of pants. I really don't want to mess with the integrity of the design and I don't want to scale the whole thing up, either. Paradox's compactness is part of its beauty. It seems unethical and dumb to screw with what is obviously a well-evolved design born of much experience.

What do you think? Go ahead and build and make the mods? or forget the whole thing and keep looking. Any other frustrated tall sailors out there?

Thanks,

Ernie
