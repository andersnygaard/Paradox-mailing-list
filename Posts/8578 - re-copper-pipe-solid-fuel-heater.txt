Hi Brian

I think that you may need the piece of scrap ply - for insulation and the cake tin - to keep all the dust contained.

For a flue pipe I used a metre length of that semi flexible metal pipe which you can get from the people who sell exhaust tubing for cars.
 Mine is 1 inch dia - which is about the minimum . If you go any smaller there will be too much resistance for the fumes to escape

Best
Jim

 Thanks for the added description of your heater Jim.=C2=A0 I was
 wondering what that "blanket" was hanging on the
 cabin side in your pictures on your blog.
 
 I only had a short time today
 to play with this heater but I did find a round aluminum
 cake pan to put under the heater and a smaller pan that I
 thought I might use as the "foot" of the stove to
 hold it off the floor.=C2=A0 The thick plywood base sounds like
 an easier stored way to protect the floor so I will probably
 use that instead of the pan but will use the round pan
 unless I find something better like a shallow rectangular
 one.
 
 The tip about the
 charcoal being a longer lasting, more gentile heat is
 especially helpful.=C2=A0 I think it will depend on the weather
 which one is wanted.=C2=A0 I'll probably use more wood
 scraps (or found little sticks along the way) than
 charcoal.=C2=A0 I'm hoping my tiny cabin space is almost
 heated from body heat alone and the heater is only needed
 for a quick burst of heat.=C2=A0 I won't know until I get to
 try it but I once used a thin sheet metal Army tent heater
 that would throw a lot of heat just from burning junk mail
 and other crumpled up pieces of paper.=C2=A0 The heat from the
 flames very quickly heated the thin metal and would be
 throwing a good amount of heat within minutes of lighting
 it.=C2=A0 From my couple quick tests of this miniature wood
 burner, it looks like this one will work the same.=C2=A0 No fire
 brick or other shielding to prevent the heat from getting
 out of the burner so it should be great for quickly warming
 up and/or drying out after a day of boating.
 
 I still need to find a flue
 pipe for this thing.=C2=A0 I might go with copper pipe and
 whatever fittings it takes to get it out of the cabin and
 forget about the flexible pipe that I haven't found
 yet.=C2=A0 It will still be removable for storing, cleaning, or
 maybe even beach use.
 
 I
 also might get rid of the bent-pipe I already fastened to my
 boat as a possible outer pipe for the chimney.=C2=A0 I think a
 simple metal disc fastened to the wall in the same place
 would work just as well to protect the wall and allow the
 pipe to exit the cabin.=C2=A0 Should be no harder to close up
 when not needed than the permanent pipe I was going to use
 and take less space.
 
 It
 doesn't look like I will get to float this boat this
 year but even if I don't, I could still sit inside it
 and pretend even in the winter if there was a heater.=C2=A0 I
 didn't do it yet but I have been tempted to "camp
 out" in this thing while it is still in the workshop.=C2=A0
 I'm thinking of my boat as an amphibian camper and will
 likely camp on it as much on dry land away from water as I
 do actually ON the water or pulled up on shore.
