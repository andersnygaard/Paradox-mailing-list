Subject: Re: Mast

Hey, that's funny, all the latest posts do talk about masts! Just keep hitting next to go back further to a topic of interest, or narrow your search. I think people have made their masts as per plans, or do you mean specifically the kind of wood?

What is everybody using for a mast?, I do not see one mentioned.
