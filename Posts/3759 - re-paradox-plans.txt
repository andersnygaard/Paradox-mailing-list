Subject: Re: Paradox Plans

I was reading on the web where Phil Bolger figured out the best shape on the bottom of a Sharpie. (This may have been done before him by others as well, I am not sure). The way I understand it so far is the curve on the bottom has to be similar to the curves on the sides. That way when it heels it presents a nice V to the water flow, and the bow tends to rise. There is also a positive effect on drag. Perhaps this would be universal to all Sailing Sharpies. Also the Paradox and Little Cruiser are ballasted and seem to be very stout. I don't know how much reserve stability they have.

I don't know enough about boats to make the call. I am reading David Gerr's THE NATURE OF BOATS, and Skenes ELEMENTS OF YACHT Design, and I have ordered a Sharpie book. I would like the plans to get started because Panama is such a great place to be sailing.

I am not sure there is an ideal boat for the sea, only a set of comprimises. Most sailors I have shown Little Cruiser to in the little folder I made who sail in and out of Panama think it is crazy. Too small, etc. All I want it for is cruising Panama Bay and maybe the Pearlas Islands.
