Subject: Re: Plywood for paradox

Hi,

I can't see any problem with that. The Paradox, as drawn, is *very* 
strongly constructed. Many boats of similar size use 6mm or even 4mm 
ply. The bottom is the area that takes the worst loading so reducing 
the side panels to 9mm should not be a problem, as long as it is 
taken into consideration in close manoeuvres.

The bulkheads won't suffer as long as the extra thickness is on the 
right side

Making sure you have a good joint laminating the bottom may be fun.

Hoping for calm nights
