Subject: Sharpie for sale

I am selling my Chris Morejohn-built 32-footer Hogfish. We had to upgrade to a bigger boat because our family got bigger. This is one rare chance to buy a sharpie, with chine runners, that's a serious ocean cruiser but also only draws two feet. Please contact me directly if you are interested. If you want to discuss Chris Morejohn's sharpies, chine runners, and ocean-going sharpies in general, post here. I don't think these subjects are too far off-topic for this group.
