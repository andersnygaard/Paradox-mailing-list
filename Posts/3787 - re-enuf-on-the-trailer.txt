Subject: Re: Enuf on the Trailer

Great stuff Derek. Only problem I see is that the trailer doesn't match the colour of the boat,Landy, and wheelie-bin!

Three new pics at: http://ph.groups.yahoo.com/group/paradoxbuilders/photos/browse/1184?c=3D

Enuf is now on the trailer.
Instead of an eyebolt through the stem I bonded in a plastic pipe acrossways and made a  grommet to attach my winchwire to. I was a little worried about the grommet (my first short splice) and the strength of the pipe. It was ok. Instead the pressed splice on the winch wire pulled free but was quickly fixed with a couple of those little u bolt thingies from the junk  box.

The main problem was that the bottom of the boat was a couple inches wider than the space between the mudguards so off they came. I'm going to have to make up some longer bolts to stand the mudguards further off from the trailer chassis.

You can see that the trailer has rollers up the middle so a couple of 3.5" by 2" were lashed to the outer chassis to keep the boat level. The bottom of the boat is now 22" above the ground so I guess to float her off I'll need 3' of water, or so. It will also mean total immersion for the wheels. The £1500 that Al's trailer cost is starting to seem a good idea :0)
