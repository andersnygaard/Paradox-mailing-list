Subject: Re: Yuloh's first use is recorded on video.

At the moment I'm in limbo because the weather has not been pleasant for sailing; maybe within the next few days it will improve.

I'm looking for an opportunity to perfect my technique for using the yuloh and no doubt calm weather will arrive when I can practise.

Bill.
