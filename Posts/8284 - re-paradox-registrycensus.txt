Good idea Bobby.

It might take some legwork to find all the boats and their history.
Bill Sargeant started a similar thing on his small sailboats site.
Unfortunately he closed it down.
The way back machine has the majority of it archived, including this list, but it's very out of date and needs many additions and amendments.

Don't forget there is a bit of activity on the Facebook page too.

Cheers
Pete
