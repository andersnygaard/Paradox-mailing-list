Johan,
I asked about these years ago and never managed to get hod of them.
It looks like they have been consigned to history!

On my page at http://paradoxbuild.webs.com/video.htm I've links to most of the video's that I'm aware of in the public domain.

They cover not only Paradox but also Matt's other boats; Little Cruiser, Enigma and Elusion plus acouple of clones. There's also some video of the Enigma 460 on George's site, http://e460.blogspot.com/

There's also a couple of seconds of Faith in the Paradox Sightings section!
