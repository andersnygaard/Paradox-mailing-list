Having traveled and camped In Europe (and anywhere else for that 
matter) I would not drink the local water unless run through a filter 
first. In fact, in some parts of Europe -  I would hesitate to bathe 
in it:-( 

See any packpacking outfitter for details on small portable filters 
and get a good one. Your health is worth the price.

Besides they have "alternate" local beverages that are far more 
palatable:-)
