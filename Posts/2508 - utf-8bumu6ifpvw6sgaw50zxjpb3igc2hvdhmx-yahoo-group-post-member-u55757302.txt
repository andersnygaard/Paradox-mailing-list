Hi All,

For what its worth......Whisper had the Foam glued in. She was thrown together and neglected by another builder. When I bought her, rainwater was standing in her. I tore out all the foam for inspection, and I found where the glue had a GOOD foam to wood contact, everything was ok. But where the glue contact was not so good, there were problems, the corners were really bad. If you choose to glue in the floatation pay special attention to the gluing process !!  For me? I'm choosing to screw in installation (From Experience).

Thanks All
David Beard
