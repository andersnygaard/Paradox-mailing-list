Glenn,

Thanks for your encouragement! I previously designed a junk rig for a Pacific Seacraft Flicka and of course my Junk Rigged West Wight Potter. I sold the Flicka before finishing the project when my wife contracted cancer. Today, my wife is fine and I have no idea whether the Flicka was ever finished.

James Beard is going to stop by and allow me to take a look at Whisper on the way to meet up with you guys at Cedar Key. I am not locked in to any program yet. There are several things about Paradox that I just haven't been able to get clear in my mind. I am fully familiar with the junk and so I'm feeding my comfort zone.

I appreciate your reply.

Perry
