Hi William.

I know the feeling as I'm in my mid 70s.

I find the mast raising job not so bad if the boat is on its trailer, or if afloat, is resting on the beach or mud so that it stays level while I'm working on the forward deck.

If afloat in deep water, the boat always starts rocking as I lift the mast in a kind of bear hug and inertia takes over which sends me and mast in all directions and makes the job more difficult and makes me feel as if I could easily go over the side..

Do you have a non-slip surface on the foredeck BTW? and is the mast built as in the plans or is it heavier?.

When I first obtained the boat, the mast was a very tight fit in its housing and I really struggled to overcome the friction to lift it out from its home. One day after a few days cruising, this problem became massive - it must have swelled a bit - and I had to use levers to prise the mast upwards to release it from its home. After that I shaved some wood off so that it became a loose fit which resolved the problem. Having a loose rattling fit there works well. no problems..

An idea for you to make guiding the mast into its hole easier. Could you build a tapered channel shaped guide just forward of the mast hole? The idea being that it would be a larger target to aim for with the heel of the mast..Could be made from sheet aluminium initially to try out and if it proved satisfactory could be made in epoxy later.

But I agree that a hinged and jointed mast may be better if the above is too difficult for you to handle.

It would be interesting to find out what you decide on and how successful the modification works out.

Best
Jim
