Subject: Re: NEW SAIL

Al,

I think you are asking to know the distance from the forward corner of the top edge of the sail to the centerline of the mast as measured along this edge. I made a print of the new sail drawing and measured it with my dial/vernier caliper. I converted the scale size to actual size. The distance I get is approximately 800mm. However, if you want the distance to the center of the halyard attachment it would be 900mm. It seems this dimension was not shown otherwise. I hope this is what you want. 

It is wise to have a long gap in the sleeve at the top of the sail. Then it is easy to adjust this dimension, by moving the halyard on the yard, to get the boat to balance well.

Hoping for calm nights,
