Hi Stephen.

I would not go down the steel angle route.
Make the web/frame 2" wide. Fillet and glass tape, three 4" wide layers the web/frame to the hull sides.
Its a lot neater and you won't have to worry about rust. It would also not look like a bodge.
I recommend you also have a storage bin between 2, 3 & 4 just under the carlin about 5" high to store GPS, camera's torches etc. Cut frame 3 away to 2" wide below this with a 3" radius under this storage bin.
This storage bin as part of frame 3 would give extra support for the deck while the storage bin will make a more comfortable backrest for both crew.
2" insulation foam between 2, 3 and 4 will make the sleeping area smooth and very comfortable.
The PARADOX is massively overbuilt and glassing this frame would not be noticed in the scheme of things.
