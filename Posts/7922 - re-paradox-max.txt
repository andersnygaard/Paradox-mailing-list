Gunther,

I've been following your progress with anticipation. I can hardly wait to hear how Manatee sails. Your photos have answered many questions for me, and I appreciate your effort there as well.

How did you treat your allergy, or did it just go away by itself?

Clear skies and smooth seas,

Mark
