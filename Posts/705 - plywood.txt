Hi All,

When I bought Whisper I stopped construction on the Paradox I was building, to get to know the boat and see if there was any changes I wanted to make. The only changes to be made are no water tanks and use plywood other than Fir. Can anybody reccomend a ply (Marine for the sides and bottom)that does not check? The checking on the interior is making a mess of my  paint job.

Sailing a Paradox and trying to build one at the same time is not a good thing ! you cant stay off the water long enough to get anything done !!

Thanks

David
