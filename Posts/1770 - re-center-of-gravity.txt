I think I shall use my knock down as a learning experience, and learn not to go out in weather like that again!

After reading "Alone Against the Atlantic" by Gerry Spies I'm actually thinking of installing seat belts at shoulder, thigh and shin level just in case. They could be made fast to eye bolts on the cabin sole outboard so as not to interfere with normal activity and kept in a locker in case they were ever needed.
