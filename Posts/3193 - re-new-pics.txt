Is this the old or new sail design?

On mine, with the old design, I fed a length of rigid foam in from 
the end of the boom which helped a little. 

If the sail rolls neatly at the mast then, due to the extra thickness 
at the seam, the roll ends up thicker. By raising end of the boom the 
sail rolls back along it and makes a thinner roll which reduces the 
size of the triangle.

Alternatively do what I usually do, stuff the extra material behind 
the storage hoop and make a cup of coffee.
