Careful with them pumps Bill. My hardener pump got some crystals in and cost me a lot of time and money in redoing the bottom. 
Michalak writes that he uses 2:1 in an unwaxed paper cup with a stick marked at half inch and three quarter inches stood in it. Much more reliable than pumps.
To be fair, I washed out my pumps in warm soapy water and they were ok after even though I stopped using them later. I didn't trust them anymore. Rob Hewiit of UK Epoxy has been using the same pumps for years.
