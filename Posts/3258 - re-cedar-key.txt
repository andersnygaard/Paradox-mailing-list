Hi Dave,

May 6-7. Always the first full w/e in May. It's getting to be a big affair with a lot of stars of the small boat building community. Last year Matt Layden was there with his new light paradox. Robb White, The Gugeon bros of WEST system, and many many others. It's a great time for all--a real do not miss affair. Hope you can be there with Wisper. Glen is showing up pretty regularly with Zoe. etc. Book now, all the motels fill to capacity that w/e. I will be sailing down from Carabele in Belle my new SP 28.

Larry
