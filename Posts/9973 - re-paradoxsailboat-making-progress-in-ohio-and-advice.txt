I was worried too about epoxy health risks. My local boat builder is twenty years in to using epoxy with no ill effects. It depends on the person. Each product must have a materials description data sheet or a materials safety data sheet, they are online, read them if you're worried.

Be careful with epoxy. I was careless with it and now have a serious allergy. I can't go near the stuff now.

To my amazement the tablesaw jig I made to cut the laminations for the deck beams had them 25x45mm spot on (first time ever using a table saw).

The first laminated beam is almost ready to be removed from its jig. When I assembled it yesterday I had everything orchestrated to the "T" but after mixing the epoxy I put on my nitrale gloves and they tore due to dry-rot despite being in a 10+ year old? Unopened box. I put the beams together bare-handed and highly suggest NOT doing that. I itched all night long. As with most things the second time should go better.

Today while waiting for the deck-beam to dry I made a curved template out of 6mm ply in order to trace it onto the other ply sheets for cutting out bulkheads. Back to the workshop!
