When I built Little Jim, I installed LEDs in all the lockers and remote corners wired back to a central battery, and I am delighted with the results. However, last weekend I found myself wondering why I had bothered.

I was buying a new set of lights for my push-bike and for 15ukp I became the proud owner of a set of 2 LED lamps. Each lamp is self-contained in a reasonably weatherproof case about 100mm x 40mm x 20mm. There are 3 LEDs shining out of the largest face. The instructions suggest that the two AAA cells may last for 100 hours. There were a number of clamps to fix to the bike with a quick-release attachment of the lamp.

I was left with the feeling that they could have been designed for a boat tent.

Of course, they don't have the ambience of that paraffin hurricane lamp ..........

Hoping for calm nights.
