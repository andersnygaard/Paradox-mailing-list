Hi Eerik,

Looks like you're making good progress. I'm not too far behind you. Mini got put together today and lined up straight and true. Most things seem to be fitting together as they should, but I can see there's going to be quite a lot of epoxy expended filling gaps where the chine logs pass the bulkheads. Epoxy's good like that!

There's a lot of Paradox's just been launched or in the works at the moment. Hoping to hear some trip reports soon from the new ones.

Cheers,

Rob.
