Hi Nels.

This is why I thought this was the oar for me, but on the other hand I might only get three kilometres to the banana.

Nels, 

Apparently this design seemed so simple to use the photographers thought a monkey could do it. So they got one and it could.

I heard the inventor was getting about 5 kilometres to a banana until the monkey got into the sake.
