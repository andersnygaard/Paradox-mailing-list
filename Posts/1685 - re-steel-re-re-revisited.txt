The AQUADA is made from GRP and they are spray rails not chine runners.
Chine runners and spray rails serve different things.
The price seems to have gone up as well.
Just think of the larger PARADOX you could have built for =A3150,000.
That=92s about $260000. 40 - 45 foot, with a heli-pad on board.
Now that you could have built in steel.
