Glenn,

I built a 10' sparrow sailing dinghy a few years ago and placed the daggerboard at the bow to create a longer CLR so that I could move the mast foward to be used as a cat rig. The system worked and the boat tracked as straight as an arrow. An interesting developement was that the dagger board acted as a pivot point when the rudder was thrown hard over the daggerboard dug in and stalled the front as the rear of the boat swung around.

I think the sail rig for the junk will work well, but might need some camber built into the individual panels to increase the sail efficiency.
