Hi all,

I finally got around to reducing the size of the article which appeared in the Aug 15 issue of MAIB and uploaded it to the files section. It has full color pictures and as such is still a very large file, almost 2 megs, so will take a long time to download if you have a dial up connection like me. I also put a copy of the article without the pictures in the same folder for those who don't want to wait an eternity for the down load.
