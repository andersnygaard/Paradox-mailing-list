Subject: Re: Has anyone gone sailing lately

No adventures yet this year, but I have had Little Jim out a few times for weekends in sheltered estuaries.

I had added quite a lot of gear over the winter. Nothing particularly heavy in itself (except the second anchor) but I felt it may be getting a bit over weight, so the trip before last I didn't fill the water ballast tanks. This appeared to have no detrimental effect on the sailing ability so I decided to remove 100lb of lead for the next trip. As I had added the anchor to the stern locker I removed the 50 lb of lead that was in there, and 50 lb from by bulkhead 3.

This was disastrous. With the cg moved forward there was considerable weather helm, and the beautiful tracking ability was completely lost. Needless to say the lead is going back in the aft locker, and more is being removed from by bulkhead 3. I shall be afloat again either this weekend or next so will let you know if that has fixed it.
