Subject: Re: build plans still available?

Awesome, maybe ill just mail him a check then and see how it goes. Looking forward to seeing the plans, it looks like a amazing little boat that can almost go anywhere. Ill probably start by building a model of it from the plans as ive never done much wood working before.
