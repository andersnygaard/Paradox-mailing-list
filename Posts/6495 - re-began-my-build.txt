Subject: Re: Began my build

Very exciting, i wish i was already there, but time and planning are a key thing i imagine, for success.I wish you luck, and i wait impatiently to see all the pics you'll post.Bravo !

With plans and build manual in hand, I started to lay out the bulkheads today.  I know it is quite an undertaking, but I'm ready for the task.

I am a novice builder, and I welcome any and all advice from those of you that have built a Paradox.  As I make progress, I will post messages and upload pictures.

Wish me luck!
