Hi Nick,

Very interesting thanks. That is very reassuring to hear that you have survived those knock downs. It sounds like your second knock down was quite a tricky situation. Not the sort of thing most of us will search out, but then again we never know what might happen out there.

I have not been quite so strict in abiding by the flotation foam installation. I have previously owned a dinghy with polystyrene foam beads in the flotation tank. This tank eventually developed some serious rot and I think the beads helped this process along. I have a number of sealed containers that are secured in place. These I hope will serve me in an extreme situation. So far I have not had to test this. I also did not build the water tanks in, again because I am concerned about rot. I carry a lot of 2 liter soft drink bottles for water. They fit very conveniently in various spaces.

Considering all the judgements I have made during the build I am happy with the performance of the boat in the situation I got myself in. I am particularly impressed with how little water I had to clean up from the inside, considering that my hatch is so far from a good seal.

Cheers
