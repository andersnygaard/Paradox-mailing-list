Subject: Re: Paradox Trailer Bolt

Thanks Nick,

Good tips on setting holes/epoxy. How long do you think your U bolt was? 4 inches?

Also, have you ever taken your paradox off the trailer while on the hard? If yes, how so, what tips you may have?

I plan to remove mine off the trailer to place in the garage. My trailer has bunkers not rollers. It does have a pivot and pin, and looking to think it through before I start. Then there is the part about getting it back on the trailer.

I prefer to lower the boat close or at ground level. If I were to eventually enter the EC300 event, I would need to remove the boat onto the beach above the high tide mark.

The U Bolt will help as well as the two forward cleats. Maybe rollers on the ground - the ones that are inflatable and rated to hold 2000lbs. Just some thoughts here.

Thank you,
Deric
