The design displacement is 1400lb.

I weighed mine last weekend. the hull is finished and glassed and I am starting on the cabin (see www.asjg.clara.co.uk/little_jim/little_jim.htm for the latest pictures). It came out at just under 600lb, so about half the finished displacement will be stores, ballast and me.
