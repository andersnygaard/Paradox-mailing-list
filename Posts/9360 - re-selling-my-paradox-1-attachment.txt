Hi Rob
Building pics

I'm very interested, problem is timing, we have just started to finish up some major works and renovations on the house. Could you please send me some more photos of your Paradox. I know what you mean about finished price, I am finishing up my OZ Goose and that has cost nearly 4K.

Hi to all , especially today all in Australia .

I am thinking of selling my Paradox for a larger boat
My partner wants to come along too, so we now want a bigger boat

It has served me well, just back from another four day trip along the Gulf here in perfect weather.

I built the boat over 8 months with a little help from a shipwright
I have built two boats prior to this one and had some experience
The more difficult jobs were completed at Duck Flat Wooden Boats, a professional and respected builder here in South Australia
It was made from the finest woods available
First Grade Marine Ply
Oregon
Hoop pine and Kapur
Completely fibreglassed outside and some of the interior is glass clothes as well

It’s made to plan, except for the mast, I paid 1250 dollars for a round hollow, “birds mouth mast” of first quality hoop pine, it’s light and a strong as can be made. I wanted to see the process and I wanted it light and extra strong, it’s also a bit of a work of art to look at.

It comes on a registered trailer
With a 2.3 Honda motor
Professionally made sail, the mk2 version in good condition
A 70 litre underfloor PVC water tank
Has some signs of wear but in near perfect condition, ready to go
The cost minus labour was over 8000 Australian dollars

All the bugs are ironed out
It sails just as it should and is a lot of fun and for me very adventurous

Wondering what interest I would get here before I advertise it on boat selling web pages

Hope someone is out sailing one right now
