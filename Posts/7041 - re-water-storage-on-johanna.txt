Thank-you for your insights... all good food for thought.

I've been struggling with the water/ballast issue, and the practicalities of loading for sailing trim and unloading for trailering.  The jury is still out on this.

I would really need to make up the deficit with more lead, as it is, she's well under ballasted with 120Kgs of lead onboard.

Is Johanna noticeably tender or more difficult to control (re. immersion of chine runners) as a result?  


Sorry, just noticed this.

No, she behaves just fine. The only reason I need more weight is because the plans call for  it!
