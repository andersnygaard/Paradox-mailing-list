Over the summer (what little we had) Bill Sergeant and I set off with 
the intention of sailing from Falmouth to The Scilly Isles in our 
Paradoxes. I wrote a report of the trip for the Dinghy Cruising 
Association bulletin. This has now been published so I feel I can now 
make it available to the rest of you. If you want to read it go to my 
web site (see my sig) and select 'Trip 5' from the Contents.

Hoping for calm nights

Al, 
Yeovil, England.
