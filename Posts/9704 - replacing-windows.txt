Hello All,

I have Lezlie Hensen's Paradox named "Tardis". Most likely know her as Scout as owned by Sean Mulligan. Lezlie did a beautiful job doing most of the build. At some point late in the process, the windows were calked using silicon, and then screwed. Silicon leaves a residue that cannot be painted, and must be entirely sanded off. So, Im in the process of sanding her windows sills down to bare wood, and will repaint. My question is, what is an ideal clear or white mastic to use for the windows? It needs to be watertight, and the goop should be easily removable when she needs a refit.
