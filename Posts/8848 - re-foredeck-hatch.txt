OUCH! I feel your pain. I have at least one blown disk, and the last time I had something like that happen to me was years ago. I got out of the shower, put my foot up on the toilet seat to dry it, and something went pop! I turned and headed for the bed about 20 feet away. I never made it, I ended up lying on the floor halfway there, where I stayed for at least ten minutes.

However, my back is the reason that I'm looking into a foredeck hatch. I can see putting my bedding and the porta potty in a crate with a line attached to is so that I can pull it back into the main cabin when I need it, but other than that, anything forward of that bulkhead will stay there until I can reach it through a deck hatch.

I've considered trying to get around that by scaling up the Paradox, but I'm not sure that would solve the problem, and introduces other concerns. First, both the mass and the cost of a boat increase as a cube of the scale factor. Second, I have yet to see any report of someone sailing a "Super Paradox", and I don't want to risk money and time on something that may well turn out to be a dog. If I'm going to risk the extra time and expense, and have to find a larger tow vehicle as well, I may as well go to a large boat with a proven track record -- one which would be easier on this poor old bag of battered bones.
