Subject: study plan questions

I stumbled on the paradox design (via a website) a couple days ago and I've been reading as much as I can getting more and more excited about ordering the plans and making one. I was hoping that someone who has made one could answer a couple questions mostly related to dimensions. 

I'm a thin (180lbs) 6'4". I've read that the length of the sleeping area is 6'2" . In the study plans here I noticed that the space between two bulkheads (I think) has a blurb by it that says "280mm +/- to suit." Does that mean that the sleeping area could be increased by a couple inches without compromising the design?

Also, what is the distance from floor to roof of the cabin? I haven't been able to find this measurement anywhere.

much thanks!
