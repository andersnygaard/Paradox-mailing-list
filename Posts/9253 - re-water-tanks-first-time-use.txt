Thank you for sharing your strategy regarding the water tanks. My tanks are like yours without anything other than epoxy and fg cloth. I too would prefer not to use the water in tanks for drinking, but do understand the emergency contingency. I had some leaking and found the cause. It I may, I will post below the cause 

Update #3

The last post i made I reported a leak in the water tank(s), and since my report I have discovered the leak. Perhaps you have the same filler tub set up?

I had placed the boat on the trailer on an incline so that water in the tank would settle aft. One gallon at a time water was placed into the starboard tank. After the 7th gallon I noticed water seeping through the weep hole and into the dry storage area. I added one more gallon to create more pressure and this helped; using a mirror I could see that water was seeping from the connection between the filler tube and the pipe to the inside of the tank. One clamp was holding the plastic tube on the pipe. After replacing the plastic tube with new and adding a second clamps the leaking stopped. 

I would like to mention that I did feel sort of a burr on the side of the metal tube that connects to the plastic filler tube. I don't think the burr was metal but rather epoxy that accidentally contacted the tube and hardened to a nice point. Perhaps this caused the issue? no matter sanding the small protruding spec was easy.

For those of us who have water tanks like ours above or use them as we do, if you encounter a leak, I hope my experience may help in trouble shooting the cause.
