I would be interested to hear what Matt has to say on anchoring, after all he has sailed a few miles now in his boat.

One of the ways I have been thinking is to have a entry pipe on bulkhead 1 which the anchor rope would exit going through a ring on the bow. This rope would be attached to a short piece of chain and the anchor. A 2" diameter bridle with a rope fitted would go between the bow ring and the anchor leading aft and attached on the aft deck. When at anchor and you want to get underway, you would pull on the rope with the bridle until the anchor rope comes to hand, then you pull the anchor up as normal and stow it on the aft deck. Go down below and pull the remaining rope into a bucket.

An easier way would to anchor the boat from the stern which is what I am thinking of doing. How about having the anchor detach from the rope so it can be stowed under the floor then one could set a sea anchor. One rope does all so to speak.
