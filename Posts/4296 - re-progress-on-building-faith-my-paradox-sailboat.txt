My original socket was made from a tufnol block epoxied into the shaft, with a blind hole in it the diameter of the ball. This was not completely successful as it is now quite worn (after 4 years). It also squeaked if not lubricated with water.

This winter I made a second socket nearer the handle, to see the effect of changing the gearing. I haven't used it yet. I found that the ball was a reasonable fit inside 22mm copper water pipe, so I bonded a short length into the shaft. Hopefully that will withstand the wear better. If I have to go back to the original location I shall try just filling the hole with epoxy and re-drilling it.

Snagging on the deck fittings has only been a problem for me during unintentional gybes (which I do quite a lot). If the sheet is hauled in and then released during a gybe then all is well. If the sheet is left slack it gets dragged across the aft deck and catches on the pin and occasionally on a cleat. I then just reach back and flip it off. It has not proved to be such a problem that I feel the need to devise a preventer.

If I were using a rowlock instead of the ball (much more wear on the oar) I would remove it when not in use as it may easily be ripped out or, if plastic, broken off.

I have made a wooden pad that sits on top of the pintle bracket so that, when the boom is well out on the stbd tack, the sheet has a smooth lead over the wood rather than over the sharp metal bracket. This seems to have solved any problems with the rudder, though the pad is looking quite worn and will probably be replaced this year.

Keep going Bill, you're nearly there.

Only 11 more working days 'till I start my summer holidays and can get in some serious boating. I *may* go back to work in October.

Hoping for calm nights
