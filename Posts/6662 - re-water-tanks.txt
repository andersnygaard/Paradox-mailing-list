Good question Lezlie. I'm thinking of omiting them also. Where I sail the lake water is clear, cold &amp; very drinkable so I don't require on board water. Now I have to fiqure out the volume so I can be sure to add the same weight as ballast.---

In the plans, there are water tanks aft bulkhead 2. I'm trying to decide whether to build water tanks, or just make it storage and ballast. I would like to hear your opinions and what did you guys do? Are you happy with your decision, or wish you'd done it differently?
