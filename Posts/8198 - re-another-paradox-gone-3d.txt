Yes I reckon white is best for the inside although I can't bring myself to use that colour for the cabin sole.......Whatever you use there will soon get get worn and roughed-up.
I last re-painted  my cabin sole with a light grey garage floor paint, thinking that it would be good for resisting wear,  but I didn't realise that  small spillages of paraffin or alcohol would melt it ...

i'd mount a lamp -   as you suggest -  on the forward face of bulkhead 2, high up near the centre is good.  I wouldn't bother with one for bulkhead 1. You cant really see in there anyway because it can only be reached awkwardly with a fully stretched arm. I put my foam pillow in there with some of it sticking out towards aft so that it can be grabbed hold of easily and pulled out for use.

Getting a head and shoulders with both arms through the access hole in bulkhead 2 is a  challenge for when you want to do any maintenance work there. It wouldn't be possible to get such  access for the the fore-peak. unless you're a contortionist.
I used velcro for fitting  my little LED lamp so that it can be bought into the cabin for fettling.

The aft storage area could do with more than just one lamp. 
Best,
Jim
