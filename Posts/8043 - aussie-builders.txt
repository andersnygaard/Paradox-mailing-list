Hi

I've had the plans for a Paradox for some time now and getting ready to start building. I would like to make contact with builders or builders-to-be that might live nearby. I live in northern NSW, Aus and believe that one or two of these boats have been built in Brisbane or thereabouts and I'd be grateful if you could contact me (text or call) on 0413948253.

All the best

Andrew
