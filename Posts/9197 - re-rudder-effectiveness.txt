Dunno about more experience, but a correctly trimmed Paradox looks like she's slightly bow down. There's lots of Paradox photos on this site with the boat looking level or slightly bow up, including my own, in my first couple of outings. They won't sail well.


I'm guessing you're talking about fighting the tiller when running. I've noticed that too, because she tends to roll and the jury's still out for me about what she'll do when the swell's are high enough that she'll surf. One thing that might be worth trying is raising the rudder to a 30 degree angle to move the lateral resistance of the hull back slightly. I've also cut a slot in the back of the rudder cheek. This catches the sheet, which then acts as a kind of tiller lock, which can be instantly over-ridden when running.


Of course, as Andre points out, reducing sail when running solves a lot of issues.
