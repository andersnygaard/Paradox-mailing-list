Bermudan, not Marconi.

Guglielmo Marconi is famous for the way he used wire stays to hold up his radio masts: so Marconi refers to the way the mast is stayed. This Paradox look-alike appears to have an unstayed mast.
A Bermudan (sometime (curiously) spelled Bermudian?) sail typically is triangular with the luff vertical on the mast and the foot more-or-less horizontal on a boom.

Just sayin'
He seems to have moved the Centre of Effort a long way forward: I wonder how this affects the function of the chine runners? Does he have lee helm?

Best wishes,
John
