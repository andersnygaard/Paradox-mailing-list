Subject: new sail rev.

Hi all,

Referring to my earlier posting 1478, I am still wondering about how a lug rig works, since I am about to order the sail.

There have been several testimonies on that the Paradox is slow to come about. Could part of the explanation be that the part of the sail that is before the mast is to small? i.e., the part representing "the jib"?

In that case 1478 makes sense, thus it would be an advantage to move the halyard attachment to the aft, 200 mm.

On the other hand, the lug sail is pretty free to move around quite a lot as I understand it, so the whole thing might be obsolete.

Any insights in the dynamics of the lug rig?
