Bill;

If you do a reprint or 2nd edition, I think that the Swede "Sebastion"
deserves a mention (heck, I think he deserves a whole book!).

Don't be put off by the swedish menu titles in this latter URL - the text is
in english. There are also many interesting pics in the non-english portion
of both websites that are worth taking a look at.
