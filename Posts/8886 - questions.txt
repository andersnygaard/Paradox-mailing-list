Hi,

I am a new member, paradox builder. I am 67, bookshop owner and live in Montagu, South Africa.

I would like to be able to post some questions once in a while (not too many). Is this the appropriate forum?

Right now I am about to cut the bulkheads and my question is about the sides of the bulkhead; e.g. bulkhead one has a 5mm space between bulkhead and outer cleat. does this mean that the bulkhead side is rounded? What happens to the 5mm space?

Regards
