I'm building an 18 foot version of the paradox which gives me room forward
for a composting head and storage. I have included a hatch and an in deck
anchor locker so that I should be able to do my anchoring and handling
of bow lines while standing in safety. I've included splash rails around
the hatch to preclude most water getting into the boat and rubber seals
that the hatch closes against. In dry weather I think the hatch will add a
lot to to my ventilation.
