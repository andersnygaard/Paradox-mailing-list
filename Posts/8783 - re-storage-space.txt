Alastair, where on the plans are deck mounted fillers shown?  I find no evidence for deck mounted fillers on Matt's plans. Don Elliot's build manual however, does show them, both pictorially and in his writing.  IMO Don's concept of rain filled ballast tanks is his alone, not Matt's. Filling the ballast tanks from rainwater off a salt laden deck will make virtually no impact on replenishing your water supply and almost certainly contaminate the fresh water that you have.

Not shown, perhaps, but seriously suggested on sheets 3 and 4. But I probably got the idea from Don. It was a long time ago.

I agree that the idea of filling from rain water is a bit optimistic. It would need a lot of rain, I think.
