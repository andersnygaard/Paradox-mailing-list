Subject: Deck Loops

Could some of you who have finished your boats give some advice?
It's about those Loops on the deck which hold the yulo on the 
starboard and the sail bundle on the portside. How did you fasten them 
down. Did you put some blocking under the deck for them? Did you use 
tubing or rod?
