The top of the vent trunk is 420mm x 250mm wide (plus or minus 
10 mm, It isn't critical). On my plans, on the transverse section 
(sheet 9) I have pencilled in 72mm for the width of the tapered 
block at the narrow end. However, as I remember, I just made up 
the block with offcuts and then ground it to shape with the angle 
grinder and sanding disc. The dimensions really aren't important, 
just make it to fit.

The side and rear panels must have come out of the offcut ply, as I 
didn't have to buy any more.

As a suggestion to future builders, I made up the vent trunk, and 
fitted the mast before assembling the bulkheads to the sides. I did 
this as I didn't have the height to fit the mast after assembly, and 
was able to do it all with the mast horizontal. But it may have made 
fiddling about with the mast step easier too.


If you are intending to drink the water then this would be wise. Give 
your supplier a ring. Some say their epoxy is ok for water tanks 
and some say it isn't

see sheet 5. The forward bins stop at the tank top so there is 
access to the space outboard of the tank sides. The aft bins can go 
to the bottom, or not as you like.

My tip for the aft bins is to leave them short except for a leg at the 
forward end. This will mean that the panel will sit nicely on the leg 
and the lower cleat on bulkhead 4 while you screw it in place. From 
experience I would also suggest fitting another shelf near the 
bottom of the aft bins. I have found that anything sitting on the 
bottom board gets damp.
