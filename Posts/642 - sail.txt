Hi All,

I am talking to Dabbler sails about a new sail for Whisper, They say they have made this sail before with success. There must more boats out there !!! They also said they have the plans and have followed all the articles with great interest. (a plus) the sail made from 5 oz dacron with bag $550.00. Is this a good price?
