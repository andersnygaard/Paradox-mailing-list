Hi John, 

I have climbed around inside an incomplete Paradox with the cabin framed up but not enclosed. I tried to find a good place to sit. It was too small. I would not be comfortable in there. I am 6' tall and 180lbs (1.83m, 82kg).

When I build a Paradox, it will be a 20% increased version.

Matt
