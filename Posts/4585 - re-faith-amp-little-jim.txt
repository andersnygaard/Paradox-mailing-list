At first when going to windward I tended to sheet the sail in too hard which had the tendency of stalling the boat.  I discovered a standing lugsail operates in a similar fashion to a junk sail that is sheeted so that the clew is situated over the leeward quarter, ie, over the point where the transom joins the side of the hull.  In such a mode the wind runs along the sail with a small angle of incidence, unlike a Bermudan sail.
