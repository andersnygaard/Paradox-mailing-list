While underway??

Great ideas,

The only problem I can see would be reentry from the rudder step, it would make you have to hop over and that would raise the c/g, most likely the pardox would not go over but you might, unless there is room?
a handle to get a hand on would be a welcome addition. even a canvas cover <keeps it light> for the outboard when stowed would help prevent snagging.

Stability is not a problem with a Paradox, I have had 3 adults standing on the aft deck without any problem.

Hoping for calm nights
