Hi Eeric

Thanks for quoting my concerns, but since your Paradox is larger than standard the tendency for tenderness may not be such a big issue as I think it would be  for my regular sized one.

There are a few issues for my regular Paradox sail. Often when I roll some of it up for reefing in stronger winds it unfortunately doesn't roll up on the boom evenly, but with creases at luff and leach, which ruins the sail shape and increases local stress.

Also when sailing on Port tack for a long time with a reefed sail it chafes against the mast enough to make a few tiny holes after a time.

Best,
Jim
