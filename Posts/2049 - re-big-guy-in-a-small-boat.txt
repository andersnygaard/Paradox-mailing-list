Claustrophobia? Hmmmm....

Being in a Paradox is much like being in a car, a convertible. With the top open, sitting on the captains chair, only your head is outside, but like in a convertible, you feel as if you were in the open. With the hatch shut, sitting on the floor, it is like being inside the car with the top up. Do you feel claustrophobic in a car? you have little space to move about in, yet some people travel for many hours without stopping, with no feeling of being shut in.

Just my take on it. If possible try to see one in the flesh before deciding.

I'm 6'5" 180 lbs and also woder if I would fit or be comfortable in these tiny sharpies. I sure like the idea though. If I were to increase the overal size of the Maradox or Micro by 10 or 15 percent than I may have a better fit withoutout all the claustiphobia (SP?) and head bumping.
