You would think somebody might want to see if Wanda would work out a deal with someone allowing them the rights to sell the manual, as I believe this little boat is becoming more and more popular. I don't have a personal contact with her or I would call her up and ask.

I don't know how I would have gotten this far without it since I am/was not a builder and the book was a fantastic help.

Subject: [paradoxbuilders] email to get building manual

hello,

I ordered the plans from david bolduc and I would like to have the building booklet from Wanda Elliott.
I tried to contact her with three different adresses, but no one in use.
I send email to get it from "Messing in about boats" magazine but it doesn't work nor contact in publishing media.

Can you help me to get the right email of Wanda or maybe somebody wants to sell me the 16 parts of the booklet by pdf file. I will pay by paypal.

thanks
