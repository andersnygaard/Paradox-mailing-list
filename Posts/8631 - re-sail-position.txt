The geometry of the curious copper pipe tack thingy allows the boom and yard to be stowed on the port side deck.
Putting it on the stbd side of the mast changes a lot of geometry.

Hi Guys,

I've just started my build after a year of plan study and daydreaming, and would appreciate some advice..

I've decided to scale up by 10%, will I need to increase some scantlings - notably the 12mm bronze tack/furler arm?

I aim to use birch ply throughout, which should be plenty strong enough in the original thicknesses. 

I will scale up the deck beams etc. 

I was also wondering if there was any reason why the sail can't be sighted on the starboard side of the mast, where it would then lie on the centre line, as surely this would equalise the pointing ability on both tacks. I realise this would probably entail a couple of blocks to route the tack line to the vent trunk, and that I'd also need to release the tack line when stowing the furled sail on the side deck.

Any thoughts?

Regards

Paul
