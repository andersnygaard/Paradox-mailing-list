Subject: Re: Paradox empty weight?

Well, keep the faith. They are difficult to acquire so building is all the more important. I have sailed in the e460 enough to know the Paradox will likely be even better. I've had the e460 knock my sox off at times flying down or across the water. When the water is just inches away, things seem more dramatic too. Having the windows and the roof makes you feel like you can push a bit harder than you would if exposed. This is one of the things the Paradox really excels in, the ability to keep you protected.

Where I live, it will realistically be at least four months before I venture into the water.

Good luck and keep us posted.
