How did you come to the conclusion that chine runners would not work? The slab sides are certainly flat enough, although the bottom is much more curved. I was wondering if it would hobby horse by having the weight moved up, or some other unseen consequence.

Any pictures up anywhere?

Just figured for them to offer enough lateral resistance they would be so long as to cause an unacceptable amount of drag......more rocker than paradox. The other concern is i had no idea where the center of lateral resistence would be so the rig would be wierd.

My computer crashed a month ago and i lost all my building shots, but i'll take some more when i finish up and post them on the bolger group.
