I took the concept and gave it a "treatment". It is only a bit wider, fuller at the transom and deeper from deck to bottom so I can have the ballast tanks at the sides and foot room between them to get a more comfortable sitting position. I drew up the plan, lofted it to get my bulkheads, and built on a strongback.

I'm working on a blog to show what I'm doing. I'll post when I get that together. I'm a year and a half, more or less, into the project and think it's realistic that I'll get it wet in the spring.
