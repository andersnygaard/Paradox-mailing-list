Alastair. Would you please let me know if Little Jim will be at any shows this year. Sad shame about Beale Park last year.

No shows planned this year, Beale was really the only one where a Paradox would fit in seamlessly.

However I shall be sailing, mostly on the south coast, as much as I can this summer. I would be happy to meet up somewhere if you want a nose over the boat.
