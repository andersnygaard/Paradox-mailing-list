I consider that that was the most physically demanding part of the build. I used a single piece (not laminated as suggested in the plans). I did a test installation, without glue, and was so worried by the stored energy if I tried to remove it that I forced epoxy in round it and left it as it was.

I would definitely recommend laminating a number of strips in place, or else steam and set to approximately the correct curve before trying to fit. Once the bottom goes on it ties it all together, of course.
