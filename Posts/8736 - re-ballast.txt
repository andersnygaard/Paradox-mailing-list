The gun JunkSail Mohamed (spelling?) Ali is Arne Kverneland as far as I can make out. If you go to JS 'way to go sites' you get quips to Arne's enthusiasm with responses like Mr Watson who writes "improving performance on junksails is like putting a spoiler on a tractor.". You've got to admit that's pretty funny. But this Arne Kverneland comes back and demolished that dis in a cool nth Atlantic manner. But I didn't write it down. But it can be found somewhere if you Google: 'the cambered junksail'.

A coincidence that you should mention twist. Just this morning I've sewn on 4 new tell tales to the leach of my sail to enable me to get better info on sail set and sail twist is one of big issues with the Paradox which I'd like to address...

I have experience with an 18ft keelboat that I converted to
junk rig. My experience convinced me that my Paradox will
also be junk rigged. One big issue I think I can solve
with the junk rig is twist in the sail. Some lug sails
twist so much that only a portion of the sail is actually
working effectively. I know this can be solved but not all
that easily. The "cure" of sail twist is a
central reason for the simplicity and also effectiveness of
the junk rig.
