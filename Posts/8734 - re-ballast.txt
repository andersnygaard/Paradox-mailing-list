I have experience with an 18ft keelboat that I converted to junk rig. My experience convinced me that my Paradox will also be junk rigged. One big issue I think I can solve with the junk rig is twist in the sail. Some lug sails twist so much that only a portion of the sail is actually working effectively. I know this can be solved but not all that easily. The "cure" of sail twist is a central reason for the simplicity and also effectiveness of the junk rig.
