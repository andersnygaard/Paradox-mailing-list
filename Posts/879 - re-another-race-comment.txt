Crazy Russian entered a cat I think. Check out the attached picture 
in one of the posts above yours. Sleeping while a cat is going would 
be about impossible without some sort of larger hull and 
accomodation. rowing one is rough as well if the wind does not 
coperate. I think Crazy russian was planning on a sliding seat from 
a shell racer. I thought the concept was cool.
