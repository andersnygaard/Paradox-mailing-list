Hi All,

I just joined the group.

Emailed Dave Bolduc at mbolduc@triad.rr.com last week, asking if plans are still available and how much they are.

Unfortunately, I haven't received a reply so far.

Maybe he's on vacation or just doesn't answer emails very often.

I think he's sailing down in the islands right now. Checks in from time to time. Not sure when he is due back.
