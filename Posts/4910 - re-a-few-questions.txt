Hi Jeff &al

Some of the discount shops around here sell an LED light that would make the most wonderful mast mounted deck light. It is intended to go on the pole of a large garden umbrella - the sort that goes into a hole in a garden table. The light is donut shaped with LEDs around the outside of its bottom side. It looks reasonably waterproof and could certainly be made fully so with a bit of silicone. Price here is a couple of dollars, so should be around a pound on your side of the world. Would take input from a solar charger as well.

I've also seen a solar shed light that should do the trick for you.  It was complete with charger and enough wire that you could mount it on the deck near the base of the mast with the light part way up.

Enjoy

They said, get a life. I looked on TradeMe but I couldn't find one.

Hi Pete.
The floor mats at Maplin's won't be there long as they don't know if any more will be coming in when the present stock runs out. I bought the camping mats for NOLI from Screwfix at under =A33 each. They also sell a foil backed version as well for about the same price, so I bought a few for under the deck with the foil showing.
My local cheap store sell a 3 LED press light for a =A31which should work well on your boat.
Maplins also sell an AA battery solar charger for =A36.99 which I bought. It will charge other sizes as well.
It took 6 hours to charge from flat 4 2600 ml amps AA's.
7dayshop.com do some good cheap rechargeable batteries. 4X2500ml amps for about =A33.50, and some useful camping gear.
I am at present looking for a good solar garden light that I could stick on to of my mast. Fit and forget.
Anyone any thoughts?
