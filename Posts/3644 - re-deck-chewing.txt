Can some of you who have finished there boats help me a bit? On page 9 of the plans. The brass tube/pipe called the tack strope. It seems to me it might rest or bump upon the deck surface and chew a divit into the deck. Am I worried for nothing?

Yes, and no. If you flare out the bottom of the pipe it will do much less damage then a cut end of the pipe. A small pad of glass/epoxy round the deck fitting will also help to reduce the damage. But the bottom line is that the paint is going to get scratched whatever you do.
 
I suppose a bronze or stainless disc bonded on round the deck hole may solve the problem if you are really worried.
