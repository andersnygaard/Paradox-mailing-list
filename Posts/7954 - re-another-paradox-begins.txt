Hi Scott,

Good to see you're starting a new build.  Aren't you the same person who built a Michalak Normsboat?  I know lots of us frequent both lists.

I'm still painting my Michalak Philsboat's interior in preparation for sale, before I can begin my Paradox.  Just out of interest, can you tell us why you sold your Normboat and are now building a Paradox?

For me there are three reasons I'm moving on from my Philsboat (which I think is still a wonderful boat, if used as designed):

1.    I'm the only one who sails.
2.    I want to go off-shore.
3.    In the colder waters I frequent, I want to be able to sleep in comfort at night, without the drafts that come through the slot top.

Cheers,

Rob.
