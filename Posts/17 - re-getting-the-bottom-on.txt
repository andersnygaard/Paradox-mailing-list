Hi Don,

Your point is well taken and I encourage all builders to follow the plans and you can hardly go wrong by doing so. However there is more then one way to skin a cat as they say and I will build the way I have found to work the best regardless of how it has been done in the past. I have never had a problem with any of my boats breaking up in a seaway and I spend a lot of time in seaways in all conditions. I do not advocate anyone following in my footsteps rather I encourage them to research their projects and find their own conclusions. My discourse is for reflection and consideration only and prospective builders have to make up their own minds if any deviation from the designers instructions are to be made. As stated above It's hard to go wrong following instructions. 

I've just finished a paper supporting my thoughts and am letting it cool before reviewing it for posting.
