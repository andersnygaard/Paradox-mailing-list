Subject: Re: Pounding?

Anyone have any experiences to report with regard to Paradox pounding, either while sailing or at anchor? (I ask because I see that Matt's new design has a slightly different bow design with a 'V' in the bottom and wonder why he decided to do that.)

Thanks for the replies on this topic...

Alan.
