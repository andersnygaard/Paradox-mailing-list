Hi Derek,

Sorry to hear about the infection. That sure can sap the energy and is no time to be playing with chemicals!

How much more of the build do you have left? Seems near the end there is always 100 things to do and they all cost money! But compared to a regular sized cruiser, Paradox is really a good deal! I think it would be ideal for cruising in the "Stock" style as you can get under cover when the weather gets miserable. Something not always possible in larger boats.

One thing to watch for when finishing is amine blush on the epoxy as nothing will stick over it. Happens when epoxy cures slowly in the presence of moist air. Haven't experienced it myself as the climate is dry here. I think it can be removed with water and vinegar or a bit of ammonia and then rinsed.

What I would do is fill the weave and then apply two thinned layers of paint (10% or so) and then go sailing. Then finish it off next spring if I had the motivation. Same with the bright finished parts.

Just be sure to knock off the sheen between coats with a small finishing sander and 80 to 100 grit paper. Later on you might want to go to finer paper (150-200) or even wet sanding - but that might be two years hence.
