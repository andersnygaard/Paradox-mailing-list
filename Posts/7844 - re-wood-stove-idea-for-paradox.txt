Subject: Re: Wood Stove Idea for Paradox

Our British winters tend to be chilly and damp, rather than very cold - by North American standards. Darkness and damp is the main problem which curtails sailing. during the mid winter period - it's dark for at least 16 hrs a day and light for 8 or less.
No pleasure for me to be sailing in the dark.

My Paradox has the little charcoal heater which is illustrated in the pictures section of this group, which helps keep the cabin warm and dry during spring and autumn. I'm not as tough as Al, so the warmth is very welcome to me.

Best,
Jim
