My mast is made according to the plans but since it is not made of Douglas fir I increased its size by the amount noted on the drawing. I also didn't take much off the corners and used a little extra fiberglass cloth. I see where some people have weighed their mast at 22 pounds, mine came in at 32 pounds. I think I will attempt a tabernacle and hinge it. There are many versions out there, and if I am not successful, it will be okay; I'll rebuild and keep the weight down. As it is, my son or son-in-law can handle it, but I need to be able to handle it myself.

Thanks for the advice. I'll keep you posted.
