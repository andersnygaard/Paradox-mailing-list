The rope tiller arrangement has worked on Little Cruiser for ten years so I have no complaints. A year and a half ago we replaced the original 3 strand dacron line with a low stretch double braided line which tightened up the steering. As for the waterproof boot, LC had one installed when we originally got the boat. However, our boat does have additional baffled ventilation in the stern of the boat. You are right to assume that by adding a boot to Paradox, you would defeat the stern ventilation.

In my experience not much water gets in the boot in Little Cruiser or in the baffle in Paradox. The little water that I have seen seems to be caused more from splashing than anything else. Still, if you had a wave break right on the stern you might get a little more in.
