Subject: paradox sails

Hi All, 

I'm starting to make the sails, I have a few questions for Glenn. I am looking for some guidance on the dimensions of the sleeves for the yard and boom. Also, do they taper? What worked for you? I will be making Matt's new sail. Thanks in advance for any insight. I am using 4.5 oz dacron with a sailrite ls-1 machine, no zigzag.

Jack
