No need to leave Derek, in fact you have a duty to stay. You contain 11% of the complete build information in the known world. As others build you have a responsibility to pass on that information so they don't make the stupid mistakes the rest of us did.

So lurk and offer advice as befits a veteran of the build process, but don't leave.

Hoping for calm nights
