Ahh, I see the problem. I don't see a solution though. Could you hammer it round the curve?  Grind it away then bond on a curved strip?

How about laminating a thickness along the edge with strips from the offcuts at bow and stern? Glue, rivet, braize or weld them on till there is sufficient thickness to grind the curve.

Failing this I think you are going to find out the hard way if the curve has any hydrodynamic effect.

good luck.
