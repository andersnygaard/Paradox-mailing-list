Subject: Re: No response on email to get build manual

Have you guys reviewed Al's website?

http://www.little.jim.freeuk.com/little_jim/little_jim.htm

I would suggest there is enough information there to get anyone started
on a build and just ask questions as you go along. Plus lots of info in
the files.

In my view the build manual is not required and in many ways overly
detailed and may actually slow you down.

I have a never-used copy in my CD library somewhere but don't hold your
breath waiting for it as I am not sure quite where to locate it right
now after a recent move.
