Thanks, Nels,
They could have gone faster outside but obviously did not, and for good cause.
Those little boats even with a 20 knt wind even when it is off shore, are a hand full.
Can't wait to see how he paddles that boat.
What a grand experiment.

Wizard is presently (10ish AM EST) only about 30 miles ahead of Whitecaps and Manitou Cruiser, and has just hit about 4 knots for the first time in a while. I think he needs a larger lead than that to stay ahead once they start upriver. Pelican looks like he has gone "outside" and is clocking almost 6 knots!! Big gamble but he is a long ways back. Crazy Russian got stranded when he landed to rest, and could not get back out on the water again for awhile due to the surf.

The next two, Running Mouth and SnoreBringsGator are quite a ways further back. Don't know if there are any others left now?

Will be interesting to see if Matt stays in the ditch or heads off-shore for the final leg north, before turning upriver.

He is going to have some great wind today and tomorrow although too much for my taste. When the wind is coming over the trees it is flukey blowing 30 one minute and nothing the next. I am sure that he is debating going outside....as we speak. I would stay inside in such a small boat. He likes to sail just off the beach, I have noticed. Of course, I wonder why? I wish I had his knowledge.
