Subject: Re: Andrew Graham's Zero

Thanks for those Bill. I'm interested in the forward underfloor water storage. I'm not at all happy about using the epoxy lined tanks as per the original design and was toying with using water containers like Andrew has done. I've found these collapsible bladders http://www.marinescene.co.uk/view/452/plastimo-flexible-water-tank-50ltr which may work quite nicely, and of course won't need to be vented.

I wonder is that dumbbell used for Ballast or is Andrew a keep fit fanatic? As I haven't found myself any lead as yet, I'm always interested in other ideas for ballast. Has anyone considered using concrete or would it take up too much space (haven't done any calculations!).
