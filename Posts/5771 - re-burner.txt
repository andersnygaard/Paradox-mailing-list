I've used extra insulation aboard Little Cruiser and in Swamp Thing to protect against heat damage to the interior structure. At the moment I've got 12" high copper flashing right around the cooking area on Little Cruiser. This looks nice when polished, and it works fine, but I think it might be conducting some heat to the wood underneath. Under the propane camp stove, I use foil bubble wrap- the double layer version type that you can get at Home Depot/Lowes, for fire protection.  This works amazingly well, and the only downside is that it needs yearly replacement since the water that splashes out of the pot corrodes the aluminum over time. I've also used this stuff in Swamp Thing above the galley since the stove sits under the deck like in Paradox, and there can be quite alot of heat build up overhead. I'm not sure how much of a fire hazard there is, but I like having the extra measure of safety. You can just contact glue the insulation on or maybe even use industrial velcro to make the periodic removal easy. 

Now the next thing I've been thinking about is using a layer or two of heavy fiberglass like woven roving for fire proofing. This should work well, and if you cover it with a thin layer of metal flashing, it should give you a very nice long lasting finish. Best of luck.
