As mentioned earlier, Matt's new yuloh is staighter than the one drawn in the plans; and in my opinion, it is harder to use. I've used both the new and the old oar on Matt's Paradox, and I really prefer the original. I think the extra curve makes the blade scull more automatically. Having said that,though, I have to admit that the new oar is more powerful because you can control the pitch of the blade more easily. Of course, this means that your wrist is going to get a real workout in the process. If anyone want to see a close-up picture of the new oar, just look in the "Photos" section under Yuloh.
