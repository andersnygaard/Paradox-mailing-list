thanks for the quick responses from all.

My concern on ventilation is that I will be sailing in warmer waters than most. I will probably need to install a 12v fan on the inside of the vent box just above where the lines exit it. For when the hatch needs to be closed.

I also might try and put a lip on the top of the baffle to stop water from shooting off of that and soaking the whole stern compartment and my back.

My last experience with tiny boats in big water was a wet one. The sliding hatch was closed tight yet waves that found their way on deck squirted an ounce of water into the boat, easy to bail but everything got wet, after a couple of days it got old. With such low freeboard the hatch had to be closed most of the time, that boat just wasn't made for big water. Paradox will be a much better all-weather type of boat.
