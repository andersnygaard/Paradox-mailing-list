Subject: Re: Larger Paradox

No problem with me I am just inquiring since someone was discussing doing it. I presently own a 26 ft stretched sharpie based on a Glen-L design, but it is not self righting and not self rescuing.. Even many commercial models I have considered are not self righting past 90 degrees.

Someone mentioned the "Swaggie" design and I looked it up
http://www.jwboatdesigns.co.nz/plans/swaggie/index.htm 

and John Welsford who designed Swaggie has just made a larger custom design for Charles Whipple.. [no relation to please don't squeeze the Charmin]= LOL at 21 feet it looks very cool

But I wanted internal water ballast and self righting like the Paradox rather than a keel as I am going places where I will want to beach it or go up rivers. I would also like inside controls so I don't have to single hand out in the freezing spray much.

Thanks everyone for all the cool comments!

This is what I was talking about. There is a lot of thought built into the Paradox that have to do with comfort and ease of sailing. If you just duplicate it on a bigger scale without changing anything on the interior you may find yourself uncomfortable or worse. Everything was designed for ease of sailing. At its original size. I'm not saying it could not be done, I am saying that to do it right you may find yourself making changes to the interior and the end result really could not be called a paradox. I would call it a 28 foot sharpie based on the paradox design. Again, this is my first boat build and as such I am too chickenshit to experiment with the design, but I have been paying attention to what the "seasoned" builders have said and I learn more every day. I am not putting down the idea of building a 28 foot replica of a Paradox, I am just sharing my inexperienced opinion in an attempt to learn more about building small boats. My apologies if my view of this subject has offended anyone.

Apart from the seaworthiness and handling issues that have already been discussed, it occurs to me that there are more subtle disadvantages of doubling the dimensions of a Paradox.

One of the great things about Paradox is the ease of handling. All the controls are ready to hand while sitting on the seat. If bulkhead 2(where the mast is) was twice as far away, it would be a fair walk to tend the sails, rather than just reaching forward and grabbing the ropes. Or, I suppose, you could do some further redesign and modify the lead of the ropes. Each change has a knock-on effect.

Paradox has had a good response from most of the builders and I think that this is, in part, because it just works. It works so well that you don't notice how cleverly the design aids this. Be prepared for a less than satisfactory boat if you start modifying it.
