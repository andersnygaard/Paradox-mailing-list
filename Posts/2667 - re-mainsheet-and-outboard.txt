Thanks Jack. 
I have had a mark 2 sail made but haven't made the mast and boom yet.

Al has fitted one as well

Matt has a VERY well thought out cruiser. 

Amen to that. There certainly isn't much, if anything, to change.

Any chance of a diagram or photo of this, please Jack?

I am hoping to be on the water for late Summer but also hoping for nothing too adventurous until I'm sure that I know what I'm doing! :0)

Cheers  .......  Derek
