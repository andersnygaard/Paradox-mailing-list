Thanks for those Bill. I'm interested in the forward underfloor water storage. I'm not at all happy about using the  epoxy lined tanks as per the original design and was toying with using water conatiners like Andrew has done. I've found these collapsible bladders http://www.marinescene.co.uk/view/452/plastimo-flexible-water-tank-50ltr which may work quite nicely, and of course won't need to be vented. I wonder is that dumbell used for Ballast or is Andrew a keep fit fanatic?

Lead weighs a little more than 11 times the weight of water per unit volume. You might consider gold at 13 times or perhaps platinum at 21....Concrete is something less than 3 times the weight of water. What that means is that you need almost 4 times the volume of concrete to get the same ballast weight, trying to keep the Centre of gravity in about the same spot. You loose quite a bit of stowing space. You can add as much steel perhaps re-bar into the mix as you can, perhaps needing about 3 times the volume of lead. Iron pigs will need about 2.5 times the space of the lead. 

Getting lead in the form of wheel balancing weights is not that difficult. Talk to one or two places where they do that, most likely they will think you a little odd but they are generally reasonable. casting it into pigs is also not very difficult. In the past I have converted about 1000 lbs into 10 lb pigs, a relativly pleasant job  when in a well ventilate place and some cool beer nearby.

As I haven't found myself any lead as yet, I'm always interested in other ideas for ballast. Has anyone considered using concrete or would it take up to much space (haven't done any calculations!).
