I going to need to buy more plywood to make the following parts:
- 9mm ply for stateroom bin side
- 9mm ply for stateroom "divider"

Both on 9mm sheet labelled "Fore. Bin Sides"

Doh! :-/

- 12mm ply for two deck scabs
- 12mm ply for vent trunk baffle

Plenty of left over scrap for these

- 12mm ply for "breast hook" piece

I think I used a bit of left over 18mm

- 18mm ply for vent trunk sides/front 

This comes from the left overs. I think I reordered the cutting by 
flipping one of the rudder pieces and moving it to the left.

I'm not picturing how you get all this out of that sheet.  And I
think your metric plywood is even a little smaller than our 4x8
foot ply here in the States!  

I also reorganized the lay-out of the sheet with the transom as it 
was too narrow to cut as drawn.

Yes, I have your drawing changes from the files section-- very
helpful, thanks for posting it.  If you have the time, do you
think you can work up something like that for the 18mm ply,
showing how you got the vent trunk sides/front and still had
enough for the breast hook piece?  That 18mm ply is costly, so if
it can all fit on that sheet, I'm definitely interested.

- ??mm ply for aft bin dividers (Also, what mm ply is used?)

I used 6mm. I bought an extra sheet of 6mm so that i could make the 
cabin roof without the joint, so had lots left over. If you are 
anything like me you will want to try various arrangements here so 
don't worry about getting it right first time.

Other than the extra 6mm sheet I didn't need to buy any more ply.
