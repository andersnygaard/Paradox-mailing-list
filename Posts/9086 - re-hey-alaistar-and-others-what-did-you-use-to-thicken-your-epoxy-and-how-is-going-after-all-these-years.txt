Subject: Re: Hey Alaistar (and others). What did you use to thicken your epoxy and how is going after all these years?

I'm sure you're right,  Frank.
That's why I prefer it.

I have no evidence,  but,
creating spaces in the resin with microballoons puts less resin in the joint:  it's cheaper.
A porous material (like wood dust or baking flour) uses more resin.   It makes the resin more viscous,  less fluid,  thicker;  and fills the joint.

No?

Best wishes,

John
