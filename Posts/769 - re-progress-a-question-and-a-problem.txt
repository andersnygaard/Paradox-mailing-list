Hello Al,

As I recall there was no problem with the side decks because the end pieces are not four feet wide at their widest. as for the mast I epoxied a piece of leather around the mast in the way of the partners to keep the mast quite and it has worked well.

The building is coming on satisfactorily with the fore and aft decks fitted and the side decks going on next week.

When opening out the hole for the mast I wondered if I should allow for some sort of protection round the mat, or is the epoxy coated mast ok bearing on the epoxy/glass coated hole in the deck?

The problem:
When I came to mark out the side decks I found what I think is an error in the plans. As the deck width is greater than 4ft I can't see how the two side decks and the two cabin end panels can come from one sheet of ply as drawn. What do the rest of you think?

Hoping for calm nights
