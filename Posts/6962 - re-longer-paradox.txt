In the group files section there is a nice but concise article called LARGER PARADOX which was approved my Matt Layden. 20% is about the max before other factors kick in. bulkheads are too far apart and so others or ribs need to be added.... thickness of the wood has to increase to sustain the greater stress.. This affects center of gravity and center of buoyancy.. (more wood increases buoyancy)  Sail, rigging and everything else must be upgraded also.

Glen-L boat plans people say not to stretch *enlarge) plans more than 10% because shortly after that all kinds of problematic things start to come up, whereby it might have been cheaper to simply start with another plan.

 Larger Paradox  
Some comments and numbers for a 20% larger (16.5 ft.) Paradox

Hope this helps,

Andrew
