Derek,

Wondering if you've decided on your 'lid' yet...

I've attempted a drawing of an idea I've in mind but need to refine it to make it intelligible. I'll attempt to describe it instead.

Basically, consists of a 'griffiths' hatch, see this article- http://www.practical-sailor.com/newspics/charts/856griffithshatches.pdf

The idea is to modify the front hinge by replacing it with a block of wood or whatever on either side of the top cover. These blocks would then slide forwards in loose tracks or grooves in two guide- rails along the coach-roof. When the hatch is at the closed position the blocks are at the rear-end of their tracks and with the correct geometry will lock-down the front edge of the hatch as it is closed. As soon as the hatch is lifted, the blocks become 'loose' in the guide-tracks and the whole hatch can be slid forward like a sliding hatch. If the guides are open at their front ends, then the hatch can be removed completely and then mounted on some sort of vertical bars directly above the opening when at anchor. Also, if the hatch is partially raised and you have a wash-board you'd be able to sit on the rear deck with a 'windscreen' in front of you.

Cheers,
Alan.
