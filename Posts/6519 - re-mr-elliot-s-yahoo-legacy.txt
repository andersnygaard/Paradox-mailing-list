With all these announcements that Don's groups is closing here is a suggestion. Go to the group, and download the files and pictures and post them here. It is easy to do. I'd do it, if I had access to Don's group. If you don't want the information to die, do something about it. You could be the one who keeps it from disappearing forever!
