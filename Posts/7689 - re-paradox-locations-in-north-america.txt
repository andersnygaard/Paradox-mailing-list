Salut Andre-Francois,

I'm located in Victoria. I'm still in the early stages of my build - just about ready to in install the sheer clamps - but I hope to have her splashed before next summer. If I do, then next summer will be all about testing the limits of the boat; a good opportunity to compare notes.

The following summer I plan on circumnavigating Vancouver Island - about 1000 n.m. -, but I'd recommend some offshore experience for that attempt. (If you care to, I'm a sailing instructor, and we can learn on the way!)

The main deviation from the plans is my split lug sail (http://www.junkrigassociation.org/Resources/Documents/Slieve%27s%20Files/AYRS%20Catalyst%2037.pdf) which promises to point better and provide more drive; and beefier scantlings and spars for extended offshore work. It would be great to compare it to a "stock" rig.

Aussi l'un de mes partenaires est francophone (et un marin experimente) de sorte que vous vous sentirez comme a la chez vous!

Darren
