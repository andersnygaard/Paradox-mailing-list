Subject: Re: Grettings! New Paradox inductee here... Need help with Yuloh specs

The construction of the Yuloh is described on page 12 of the Paradox plans. However, it's not too difficult to do since I even made a yuloh myself in 2011 for ENIGMA (http://www.microcruising.com/new2a.htm ) using primarily a saber saw and a hand plane. First I glued two 3/4" thick boards together with epoxy making sure to elevate the ends sufficiently to create the amount of curve I wanted. You can get a rough idea of how much spring back you will get from the laminated wood by temporarily nailing the two boards together after putting a wedge on each end and applying some weight to the middle. After you release the weight, the boards will move up together a bit, and I've found that the actual glued boards will move less then this by as much as 50%.  However, I wouldn't get too crazy about this measurement since the amount of curve in the Paradox oar isn't that much to begin with. After the boards are glued together, you will transfer all the measurements from the plans and then rough cut the outer dimensions.Finally you will need to spend several hours carefully planning everything down to shape.  Making some cardboard templates of all the oar profiles along it's entire length will make the whole process go more smoothly and accurately.
