Thanks for this Bruce.
My wife was very amused; it is what she suggested!

In my opinion, wood grain runout can be viewed similar to a scarf joint. If the runout of the grain is more than 8:1 or so, the wood piece could be improved by cutting out the section and replacing it with a 8:1 scarf.

In short, filling the knot with epoxy would do nothing to fix the grain runout.

In an emergency, I might be tempted to wrap the spar with fiberglass and epoxy on the section with excessive grain runout near the knot.  [Just my opinion.]
