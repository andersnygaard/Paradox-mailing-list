Subject: Re: Chine Runners

The Triloboat chinerunners were close to the surface. Dave (the designer) even told me at one point he thought they did not work well because they were not deep enough. The Robbsboat has the same hull depth (when properly loaded) as the Paradox, and so I would expect that the CR's would work on her. I don't think the dragging bow has anything to do with the CR's. You may notice that the Enigma (both versions) now sports a Bolger flying bow (just like the Robbsboat, AS19, AS29, etc, etc). Ultimately, I think it is the heavily rockered (giving you some depth in the water) hull and the CR's in combo that provides the LWR. The real reason for not dragging your bow is easy tacking/turning in low wind conditions. It allows for a shorter WLL, hence faster tacking in ghosting conditions. When there is enough wind, it does not matter. The other side of that coin, is the pounding you get (when flying your bow) in big water. Everything is a freakin trade-off as usual.

On Paradox, Enigma, and 460, the peak of the rocker is slightly aft of the center of the boat. This is to optimize where the CR's are doing their work. It may be that on the Robbsboat (it has a symmetrical rocker) the CR's may be a bot too far forward, again due to the rocker peak being somewhat further forward (than a Paradox, etc!).

Just my opinion, it did not cost anything! If I'm incorrect, please enlighten me (in a civilized way if possible!!!).
