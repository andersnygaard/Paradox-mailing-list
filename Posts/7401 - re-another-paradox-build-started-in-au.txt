Hi John,

That's a beautiful looking model. You are going to far more trouble than me. :-)  I'm going to fair and paint my model, so the woodwork (balsa) is pretty rough.

Dave Bolduc has the plans. His contact details are in the Files section of the group:

Dave is in the Bahamas in Enigma at present. I'm not sure when he is due back. He has been checking the group emails now and then.
