Hello Paul,

Here's the information you requested.

Most of Paradox's weight is below the waterline, actually in the bilge.
Let's see what is down there.

120 pounds of plywood (3/4 inch) and lumber (tank structure,at the bottom).
400 pounds of lead (10 forty pound pigs,strapped down). (Matt allows less if you like, I installed the 400 lbs). If you want to carry more cans of food and other equipment then you could reduce the lead amount, just make sure that weigh is secure).
75 pounds of roving and resin (on my boat, you could reduce this to 50 lbs, it's nice to know it's there when you run up on that rock or reef)
150 pounds of water in two tanks (the tanks must be all the way full if you are cruising,at all times)
80-100 pounds of food. (you actually run out of room before you reach that amount)(a week's supply)
45 pound battery
40 pounds of anchor and line.(I carry  two so double this, if you do the same)

Total 930 pounds in the bottom of Paradox.

Above the bilge is the following.

200 pounds of plywood and structure above that.(this would put the hull weight at about 400 lbs, it might end up heavier if the interior is epoxy coated)
35 pounds for mast and misc. gear  above deck.

Total, 235 lbs above the floor.
200 pounds the crew and their gear.(in bad weather put this weight on the floor for maximum stability.

That comes to 1,365 pounds, I built my boat extra heavy, you could build it lighter. This leaves 45 extra pounds for whatever, however the rudder might weigh that, nope maybe half that.

The waterplane as I remember will sink the boat 1 inch for every two hundred pounds, so an extra 100 pounds will only lower the boat 1/2 inch. As I said earlier Dave and Mindy cruise together, so they must go over that displacement some. However, stay as close to it as possible.

The complete set of Articles on "Building Paradox" can only be obtained from me directly.

Hope this answers your questions.
