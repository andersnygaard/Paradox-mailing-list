Kjel, 

I also thought of a metal bottom for paradox and the problem of the curve of the chine runners. I was thinking of stainless steel. Sorry I don't have any recomendations on how to bend the metal around the chine. Would appreciate more info on this elastic epoxy that you are using. Are you not using any mechanical fasteners? 

Best Luck, 
Robert
