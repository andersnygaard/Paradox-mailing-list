What I was wondering is what you do when there is no room for a 
portapotti, as in Paradox? The other thing is what does one do if one 
has a child on board who has to go "Now".

I find the seals and seabirds rationale rather interesting. I also 
realize that birds and dogs do the same on my front lawn. But I am 
not sure if that justifies me pooping on your front lawn:-)
