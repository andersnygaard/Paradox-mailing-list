Subject: Re: Glass wet-out problem

Steve,

Lately I have tried using a squeegee to apply epoxy to cloth and I am sold. In the past I used a brush exclusively and I feel that I had issues with floating glass, too much resin. The squeegee makes it easy to remove bubbles. It is also easy to move all of the extra resin to other areas without dragging the glass or starving it. It doesn't seem it should work as well as it does but I'm not going back.

I have never had the wet-out problem explained here and I hope I never do. Its like the glass is coated with a binder for polyester resin but I know that was ruled out. Good luck with figuring it out.

Sincerely,

Gene T.
