Hello, 

This is to notify the Paradoxbuilder group members that I have created a new Paradox boat builders group. Everyone is welcome however Nels, Betelgeuserdude, and DC are not invited, for they are only around to play childish games, and do not benefit the more serious Paradox builders. 

My hopes are this new group will help and assist in a meaningful way for Paradox boat builder everywhere.
