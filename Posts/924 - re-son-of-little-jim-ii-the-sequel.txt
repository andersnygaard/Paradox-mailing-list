I've used the old "inverted flowerpot on the stove" routine to great success, but it always leaves me feeling a little nervous that I may find the hot pot visiting the nether reaches of the interior. When my wife and I lived aboard our little 20' canoe yawl, we also used our gimballed kerosene lamp as a heat source when the temps were mild and we were underway. I wonder if a such a lamp would be practical aboard a Paradox, or just an imposing novelty?

I would think the small welsh miner's style of gimballed lamp would be perfect. Being insulated, I would think a Paradox would warm up easily.

Could you tell us more about your 20' canoe yawl?
