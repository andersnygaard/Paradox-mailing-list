Hi John, 

I know, I am in no way a boat building expert! The boat will be build together with a German boat building Master, he will do all the geeky stuff, I will just help him. There is no way to build a boat here in my town, it is like building a boat in downtown NY...lol...
My live will depend on that little boat, that's why I pay the Boat Master to build it, better save than sorry....

Regards Chris
