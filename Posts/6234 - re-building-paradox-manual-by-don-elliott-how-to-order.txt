Cathy,

You must be driving those finals too hard if you keep blowing them. In the 30 years I've been running QRP (usually about 3W), I've never lost a PA transistor. But you're right, homebrew is the only way (all my kit is homebrew other than a Junker straight key, and a Bencher paddle).

I'll be QRP MM from Johanna!
