I cut all my beams to about 1/4=E2=80=9D thin
Clamp them in the shape needed and leave them resin glued together for at least 24 hours=20
They spring back about 10% , so a little more curve is needed in the jig
The jig is made on a flat board=20
Covered in packaging tape to stop the resin glueing the beam to the board=20
Simple right angled bits of wood block screwed hard to the board
One in the middle one each end=20
Clamp in exactly the same place each time if your making multiple beams and the results will amaze you , simple and easy and fast=20
I use dual coloured woods to highlight the finished product=20

Hi there,
I am sending you a picture of a simple wood bending jig. I bent 19mm thick oak pieces ripped from solid oak skirting boards. No steaming was involved in the process. I put the oak pieces in a little pool for 4 days at least. Once completely soaked oak starts bending slowly under pressure and takes shape. I fitted the pieces on a fence post(100mm) and I left the wood for drying in my garage. Not a quick process but it works for me.
P.S. I suspect this "cold water" process  won't work for pine. You might need steam for pine. Or, if you need a quick build, just laminate thinner pine layers under clamp pressure as in this 2nd pic. I laminated 5-6 mm thick pine and meranti layers in that project.

Good Luck,
Haluk

Thanks for everyone=E2=80=99s input. So the plywood de lamination issue in making the beams had me reading through every post about deck beams today. I picked up some great tips from the read through, especially building the jig from the BOTTOM of the beam=E2=80=A6.now I have to modify my jig but at least I didn=E2=80=99t make 7 unusable beams!!!

I think how I am going to approach this is by making the laminated plywood for beams on Bulkheads 1,2,5,6 since they have bulkhead support in the event of de-lamination and use solid Mahogany strips (laminated) for 3,4 as they are unsupported and solid wood should be stronger or at least not separate like ply =E2=80=9Ccould=E2=80=9D the solid beams are coming out to 48mm but I can either sand the 3mm off or set them 3mm lower on the cutout bulkheads I=E2=80=99m thinking

I also saw someone laid out the bulkhead patterns and cut those into 6mm ply and glued/screwed a 3/4=E2=80=9D hardwood to it. This option seems way easier but know nothing about that techniques strength?

Also researching 9x6mm vs 5x9mm for laminations strength, any ideas on that are welcome!
