Subject: The Classic Paradox Boat "Zoe" Destroyed in Transport

For those of us who have long admired Paradox boats, this is a sad day. One of the best built boats of the type, "Zoe", built by Glen Maxwell was being transported from Florida to California to its new owner - me (Mark Hamilton). For as yet undetermined reasons the hauler's enclosed trailer caught fire and the blaze could not be extinguished until the trailer and boat were a total loss.

I know Glen cherished Zoe, and owing it was a dream I held for more than 15 years. For someone like me, not having the wood working skills to build one, the chance to own this Zoe was a lifetime dream. 

For those who love Paradoxs you know that the monetary loss (which is covered by insurance anyway) is irrelevant - its intrinsic value was nearly priceless.

I still can't believe it.
