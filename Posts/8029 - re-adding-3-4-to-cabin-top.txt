Subject: Re: Adding 3-4" to cabin top?

It looks like the potential is there to "inch" a number of the vertical dimensions.

1" lower cabin sole

1" added to shear

1" added to cabin top.

3" total gain.

The rig's working geometry would stay the same with the CE 2" higher with a 2" addition to the mast and the roller furling arm mounted on a 1" block above the deck.

I would be happy to hear from any "taller" sailors who haven't had any problems with the stock configuration.
