Subject: Re: Internal mast wiring

Hi Pete,

I only have one 2 core wire for my mast-head lights. (white and tricolour)

I lined my mast with short lengths of pipe insulation at intervals so that the wires could be pulled through (in the case of future damage) but would not rattle about and keep me awake.

At the top the wire comes out at the front of the mast and is sealed with bath sealant.

At the bottom I fitted a waterproof connector, flush with the mast so that it won't get damaged when fitting the mast. This is just above the bottom block and the mating connector can be fitted by reaching into the vent box from inside. 

When rigging the boat it is quite transparent and I usually only plug in the cable when I know I will need the light (not very often).

The fitting on the mast can be removed out-the-way so I can get at the screw connections when they work loose (!) and I have a spare foot or so of cable sitting at the bottom of the mast so if it gets damaged at the top I can pull a bit more through.

Hoping for calm nights
