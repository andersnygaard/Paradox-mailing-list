When I finished my rudder and stock, I was amazed at how massive they are. My Michalak Philsboat had a solid stock and rudder and Paradox is 1.5 times heavier again.

The only component that concerns me is the lower gudgeon / pintle arrangement. That's where all the forces are concentrated. Perhaps under severe conditions the pintle might bend or the gudgeon break.

Which brings me to my point. I cast my gudgeon months ago, but couldn't locate woven roving to cover it. Do you think the woven roving will bond to the gudgeon after all this time, if I rough up its surface?

Now that I come to think about it, it's those six layers of woven roving that are actually doing the work on the lower gudgeon. They are equivalent to the steel bands around the ends of a barrel, so to work they must go ALL the way around the gudgeon and that means the bolts and friction against the hull would keep the roving in place, even if the epoxy bond to the gudgeon wasn't as strong as when the epoxy was fresh. I'm not an engineer, but that's my take on it.

Cheers,

Rob.
