I still have not worked out how to make the socket.  It needs to be made of a tough material able to withstand wear from the ball and yet run smoothly. Well greased metal to metal is probably the answer,

I would give graphite loaded epoxy a try. It's slippery and very tough.

Yes, and easy to repair any damage that does occur, just fill the hole and drill it out again.

Hoping for calm nights
