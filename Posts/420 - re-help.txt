David I think the biggest problem with smaller scantlings is that the boat will be lighter and therefore require more ballast. This is not necessarily a bad thing because the weight will be in a better place. On the down side you won't be able to use it as a battering ram on as heavy an object as you could if it were built as specified. It should still serve you well for many, many years.
