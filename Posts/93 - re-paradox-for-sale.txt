CONGRATULATIONS GLEN !!!!!

What a beautiful Paradox. From the picture, it looks as if she just left the factory, with this perfect finish.
One point of critique : you're too modest, hiding the Launching as a side note to another message!

Happy sailing!

Bert.

Original message:

Hi All;

To the best of my knowledge, it is still for sale. I've been meaning to give Bob a call and see if it has been sold yet and will do so after I return from Philly on the 21st.

As another note of interest, I launched "Zoe" today and went for a short sail in winds of less then 5kts by a friends anemometer and she gosted along between 2.2 &amp; 3.3kts, by my GPS. I've got to run for now but will post more on her first sail later, I am in love with this little Paradox and had more fun this afternoon then I've had in a while in a sail boat. I'm including a picture of her gosting up to the dock. As you can see from the picture she was very light as I only had about 75 lbs of ballast and no water on board. Her stability was still quite good though as I could only pull her over about 45 degrees by standing on the dock and pulling her mast down. She will be a treat when properly ballasted.

Tailwinds,
Glen
