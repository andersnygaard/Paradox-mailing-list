Thank you,

So far two ways to remove the paradox from trailer. I am looking to remove the boat from the trailer at a beach in Florida above the high tide mark.

I am not sure I can push the boat off the trailer and have the trailer angle downward after the pivot pin has been removed. There are inflatable rollers that are rated for 2000lbs that may help in the solution.

Just working through the physics and steps to make this happen. In the EC300 one must be able to launch from above the high tide water mark, from the beach. Rollers will play a roll here in moving the boat to water.

Hmmmm more thinking.
