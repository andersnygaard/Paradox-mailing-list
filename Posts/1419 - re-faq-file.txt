Exactly -  My original premise was that Paradox is faster than it might appear when first looking at the hull shape. 

My experience is that many people doubt how this can be. And also doubt the efficiency of the chine runners. I see the hull design as a very intelligent blend of factors and one can't just view each one separately and think "Well that doesn't look right!"

I think it would even be even faster if it had the overhangs and was longer for it's beam. However, it is not a racing machine no matter how you slice it. It is a very good, efficient sailing package for how it was intended to be used. A skinny water micro cruiser for one person. There are many doubting Thomases out there, but none of the owners are a part of that group:-)
