Most will tell you that the Pearl rows ok mostly to get you out of a hard chance or a modest distance at no more than 3 mph.  I disentangled myself from a lee shore in the mangroves down at Cayo Costa when my engine woulddn't start.  It rows pretty good but not near as easily as the yaloh with experience.  I'd fancy a Pearl doing quite nicely with two rowing stations. My tri would be a likely candidate for a yaloh.
 I'd bet the qualifications you site for Matt made a huge difference not matter what the boat.

Hi Larry,

I was also wondering how efficientely a Seapearl rows with one 
person? At the beginning, there was very little wind. Obviously Matt 
knows how to use a yuloh as well as being a very skilled sailer, 
strategist and navigator:-) 

Perhaps he may have created a class of his own! The microcruiser 
class. Or gotten himself banned altogether!
