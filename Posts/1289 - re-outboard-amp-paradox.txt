Subject: Re: outboard &amp; paradox

I also would be interested in knowing if anyone has fitted an outboard to a Paradox and with what results. I seem to recall seeing a photo of Little Cruiser with one. Was the outboard on Little Cruiser found to be unsatisfactory in some way? Anyone ---- ?
Cheers,
