Subject: Re: What would you change on 2nd build?

My boat has not been finished but If I were to build another paradox I would be sure to have a shelter to work in that allowed work to be done in all weather conditions.

And I would definitely use a slower drying epoxy the next time I try to install the forward deck on a Paradox.
