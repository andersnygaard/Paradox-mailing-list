Hi Al,

That's what I meant by not thinking twice on using brass screws.
That's why I used them on NOLI everywhere as well as glue.
Do you know what type of ply Bill used?

Marine, I think.

I only laminated three parts on NOLI and they were the top forward part of the coach roof, the front of its windscreen and the hatch top. The windscreen and the coach roof were made from three layers while the hatch top was made from two laminations of ply If bronze nails are to be used, why not just fit them just below the waterline and anything above could be brass screws. Save a bit on dosh. 1 1/4" X 8 brass screws from Screwfix are =A36.26 for 200.
But it is so much more satisfying to bash in a nail. :-P

Hoping for calm nights
