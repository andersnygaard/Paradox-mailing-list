As most members are probably aware, this design was the predecessor to Matt's Paradox. If not then studying this design may be of use, and in my opinion about perfect for a smaller couple. I was particularly attracted to the sail plan, which is "almost" a junk rig without any sheetlets. I have read elsewhere including from Arne Kvaener (sp?) that a junk sail less than 100 square ft., doesn't really require sheetlets. This one is 125 sq. ft. - so maybe one set might be a thought? But Dave and Mindy Bolduc have sailed LC all over the Bahamas and elsewhere just the way it is. And are able to reef and raise the sail easily from inside the cabin. Of course the lazy jacks are needed.

Some added features are the mast design - deck mounted with hardwood struts to facilitate raising an lowering the mast easily  getting under low bridges. Instead of chine runners it has a large rudder area and a small centerboard well forward to have room for 2 to easily bed down below. This is very similar to a few Phil Bolger designs like Cartopper. 

Well, you can read about it here, and offer comments. I think a staff canted outwards off the stern would be needed if including a set of sheetlets? Or if the hull were longer then add a mizzen mast aft and run the sheetlets down from it to the helm position? I find a mizzen almost mandatory on a small shallow draft hull to hold it steady at anchor and into the wind when reefing or just stopping for lunch.

I think Matt decided on a quicker way to lower the mast in his Paradox design as he doesn't have a motor so uses a yuloh for propulsion. Dave uses one as well, but also uses a small OB. They love LC as do I.
