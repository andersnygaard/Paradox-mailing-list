Subject: Re: It begins


I'm going to wish you luck, because you'll really need it to get into the water before the new year.   Not that it can't be done, but most peoples realities just don't allow it.  I started to build my (non paradox) boat two years ago, and I "might" get it into the water this year, a big might.  Ultimately I bought a boat just to have something to sail

Anyway, for what it's worth, here are some things I learned (the hard way) and here is some generic advice.

Don't get too obsessed with buying system3 or any other brand of epoxy.  ALL epoxy comes from two or three major chemical distributors in the US.  It's generally very close in composition, if not exactly the same stuff.   I buy from a polymerproducts company out of California, on ebay.   I chose them because shipping is cheap to me, and their prices are good (less than 50 per gallon delivered).

I first started buying the "thixotropic" stuff.  Everyone sells pre thickened epoxy.  Sounds nice, but it ends up being a pain to work with.  I learned that (for me) what works best is to use unthickened paint-able epoxy, and mix it up for each job exactly how you need it for the task.   ALWAYS mix up the epoxy first, then add your "additives".   Buy ALL the epoxy stuff you need first.  Buy plenty of disposable gloves, masks, tongue depressors, mixing cups, mixing sticks first.  Epoxy is nasty stuff to work with, I find it the most annoying part of boat building.  I'm building a stitch and glue boat.  I loved working with the wood, but now I'm working with the epoxy and it's a drag.  My next boat will NOT be a SnG design.

Pace yourself.   The Paradox is a small boat, but very complex, much more so than the vast majority of small boats.  It's gonna take a looong time.

Good luck on your build.
