Subject: Fitting it all in

In doing a bit more research of long distance cruising, there seems to be an emphasis on "provisioning".  That is, fitting everything into the boat you can carry to keep you alive in case of an emergency.

Some of these big-boat "necessities" are fairly large, so I was wondering if there are usable alternatives for small boat living.

Watermaker/desalinator?  Do they sell hand-pump filters or micro distiller kits?  This would be a worst case item if you had little or no rain for a while.

SSB radio or VHF communications?  Always nice to call home or get the coast guard out to rescue your sorry butt.  How big are these things?

Radar?  I assume they need to be mounted on a mast, lest the waves interfere with the signal.  Are there small units available with a warning signal?

Life raft / unsinkable dinghy?  I know there are fold up units, but I'd be scared to use one of these as a life raft in bad weather.  A cold day in the middle of lake michigan would neccesitate a rather dry life raft.

I guess what I'm getting at is this.  If one want to use a Paradox to "lose sight of shore", how and what do you pack for your worst-case scenario, without loading it down to the gunwales?
This is assuming you're crazy enough to take this tiny boat away from shore for several days or weeks at a time.
