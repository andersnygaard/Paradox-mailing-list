Yes, a very good point. The ones I have are fully sealed and can be mounted in any orientation, but could still leak if say cracked or seriously over-charged. Certainly needs careful consideration to get a good long-term installation.

Hi guys,

Regarding batteries in wooden boats, I would make sure the areas you decide to put the batteries in are extra well expoxied and glassed, as well as rinsed out very very often with mucho grande amounts of water and perhaps even a final rinse of a neutralizing or buffering solution.

Man, that's a long sentence :)

Anyhoo, getting even a trace of battery acid into the wood will destroy it faster than an army of termites with buy one get one free food coupons....

Take care,

Blll
