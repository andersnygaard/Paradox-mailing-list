Derek,

I have the MK2 sail on Zoe and have had the MK1 before that (Bill Sargent has it now) and I attached the tack up close to the drum and the sail does not gather forward as long as the clew end of the boom is raised a little. Of course I use a topping lift and that helps a lot. For every ones information, when I ask Matt how in the world does he make it look so easy raising and lowering the sail with out a topping lift? His reply was that he holds tension on the Halyard when lowering with his foot, when raising he holds tension on the furling line with his foot. Try it for yourself, you may find you don't need a topping lift.

a little bigger taper would be in order then?
I'm not sure that it will be any help. I've made my boom with the taper shown in the plan but I think that the increased angle of the tack on the MK2 sail means that the tack securing point has to be further back along the boom. On the other hand I can't get my head around the sums but so long as my new boom rolls better than the last, why worry? I should know if it does on Tuesday.
