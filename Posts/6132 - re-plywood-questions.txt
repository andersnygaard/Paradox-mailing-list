Not sure, it was a while ago. It was the cheapest BS1088 ply I could get locally.

No idea. It is skinned with epoxy/glass and paint on the outside and lined with epoxy and polystyrene inside. I have never felt the need for a detailed inspection.

The plans call for exterior ply, and the fact that it is so overdesigned would probably make up for any slight weakness due to voids. I used marine ply as I wanted the boat to last a long time and the extra few hundred pound didn't seem much when the total investment was considered. YMMV.

That said, the original Paradox is exterior ply and seems to be lasting ok.

I think there is one Paradox which has been built from scrap timbers from pallets etc. Some cats can be skinned to fit your purse.

Hoping for calm nights
