Thanks for that. It confirms my own ideas.

I am not intending to glass the hull above the water-line as I am building from marine ply (good finish both sides) and do not expect it to get hard use as I rarely come alongside.

Al, it really doesn't matter because the wood will be covered with fiberglass but from a functional standpoint the forward panel should overlay the aft because the water flowing past would not have an edge to get under if it were done in that manner.  A note of caution if you are going to stack the ply and cut the scarf of the two panels at the same time, give some though to the fact that you want the bad side out (will be covered with glass) so one of the cuts will be on the good side and one on the bad. 

Tailwinds,
Glen
