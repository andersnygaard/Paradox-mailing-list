Thanks, I don't really see myself as being brave, it is just what I want right now. I have often had to laugh at myself for getting angry with the lack of wind or some other situation. When there is nothing you can do about it you just simply have to accept it. I have also congratulated myself on how well I am sailing my Paradox only to get the next tack wrong and land up running into a moored boat. Sailing a Paradox is a very good way to be kept honest and humble.
