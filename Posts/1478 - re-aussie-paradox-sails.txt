Great! Soon it will be truly said that the sun never sets on the Paradox. 

Great pictures too.

Hello all
Another satisfied Paradoxbuilder reporting a successful launching on 29 November 2003. The Aussie Paradox now as a name "Zero"and has been sailed and slept in. See my new photos under Aussie Paradox. I haven't read any posts since my last contact with the forum and will tentatively claim Zero as the first Aussie Paradox to hit the water.

Hoping for calm nights
