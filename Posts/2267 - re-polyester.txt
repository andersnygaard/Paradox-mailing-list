Subject: Re: polyester?

Thanks for the interesting replies to my polyester question!  Yes, I'm trying to keep my Paradoxproject on a tight budget. I live in the middle of Sweden , 2 hrs by car to the nearest coast, so I believe my vessel will stay on land most of the time. Her trailerability is of fundamental interest to me. The ply I use is not marine but exterior grade. (So is almost all ply nowadays I'm told)  It has rather soft surfaces, so I intend to fiberglass all outer surfaces. As for the polyester I reflect on, it's advertised as "extremely adhesive" .  I believe that means it's sticky enough on bare wood. I don't  know much about chemistry so I think I have better study some literature before I decide.

The polyester cloth I used on the divinycell is 240 g/m2 (Sven's method) and it's quite friendly on smooth surfaces, but tricky round angles, especially on a sharpie like Paradox. The thick divinycell allowed me to make all angles smooth, still when I was about to laminate the outside, I just didn't make it. When I had put the first 2 layers on, everything was in just a mess, and I had to tear everything off and start all over again. I had to call in Lasse (Bris-boat Libra) who is a painter and experienced from several Bris-buildings. I don't know how he made it, but in some kind of wizardry, all the wrinkles and bubbles disapeared. If it's your first attempt, and you're not a magician, I would suggest at least thinner cloth.
Another problem with polyester is that when you sand it, the surface becomes fluffy, like velvet. So, to make a nice-looking smooth planking, you have to use lots of filler, or, perhaps better, put on an extra layer of very thin fibreglass cloth, to save filler.
