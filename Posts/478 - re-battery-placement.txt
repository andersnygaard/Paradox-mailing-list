It's just another compartment, I keep my tool box in there with the battery and there is still room for other stuff. Keep in mind that Matt lived aboard his Paradox for some two or three years while cruising from Nova Scotia to the lower Bahamas (if what I have been told is true and I believe it is) so I'm sure he had plans for every compartment in Paradox. So far my longest trip has been a week but Zoe was loaded for a month for ballasting reasons. You won't appreciate all the design work that went into her until you have cruised for a while.
