I think ? Fast set hardener will get hot faster to ?

Epoxy has a chemical reaction that gives off heat as it cures.

It will set slower if it's in a tray, flat open and a thin layer, and much quicker in a bulk amount. Much so, it can heat the container it's in to melting point with plastic and hot enough to burn your bare hand in a metal tin. It may be it just got too hot?

Subject: [paradoxbuilders] gudgeon

Can't see the photo, but I recall only using glass matting, not microfibres. My mix was the consistency of thick porridge. I think the amount of epoxy used would have been much less than 250ml, perhaps 100ml. Unfortunately, I can't remember what I made my mold out of, so I'm not much help to you there. I think I might have bent a bit of tin into shape using screws into a piece of plywood. That would have let the heat escape as the epoxy went off.

Hi All,
This morning I wanted to make the gudgeon out of epoxy and I used micro fibres and fibres of glass matting. I mixed 250ml in a large container.
The result is as shown on the photo. The epoxy mix heated up and bubbled out the mold.
(outside temperature is 21C)
Any suggestions what went wrong?
Kind Regards
