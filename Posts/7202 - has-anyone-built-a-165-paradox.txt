Subject: Has anyone built a 16.5' Paradox?

Hi everyone,

In the 'Files' area of this group, there is a document describing a 'Larger Paradox', which increases all the linear dimensions by 20% to yield a 16.5 foot LOA.

Has anyone here built this? ...or know of one being built?

A slightly larger Paradox appeals to me. One concern I have is whether I could get the sides and bottom onto two sheets of ply. Or are scarf joint really so much fun that I'd want to do two per panel? :-)

Thanks,
Matt
