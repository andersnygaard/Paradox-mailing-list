Subject: Re: Spar and Sail Internal Stowage

It is a tight fit, but it does go in (you have to remove the furling axle from the boom), the  plywood discs on the furling drum are the tightest fit. It is a bit of a fiddle, as you have to do a bit outside then a bit inside, but It is all nice and secure when travelling, with no danger of anything coming loose.

I wouldn't like to travel any distance with the boom in the normal stowed position as it sticks out quite a bit behind.

I reckon it would (just) be possible to sleep on the road without removing the spars if the bed was set up ready.

The mast will lie along the top of the stowed boom, with a simple lashing at the front. This is how I carry it to sail under low bridges

I wouldn't want to be without it. The security on long journeys is very comforting.

As an extra, it is useful when attaching the rear deck fittings. It is easier to reach in the hatch than crawl through bulkhead 4.
