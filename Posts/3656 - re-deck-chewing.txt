Oh ho. I see. Yes I was wondering if a four foot wide hull might be a bit quick in it's roll. Good sleep is worth a good deal to me too. At some anchorages I have set out two anchors, for and aft, so as to keep my bow into the worst of the swells, or boat wakes. My Picaroon is what I'm using now. If I had a Paradox I could go traveling far and wide on a wee trailer. The picaroon is not a trailer kindly boat.

I value a good nights sleep (which I usually get in my Paradox) but 
find it difficult to sleep on a lumpy sea.

Hoping for calm nights
