I'm still here, and will follow where you lead.

But, I really hate web based systems, so would probably only contribute if the system included email.

Thanks for your efforts.

It turns out there's an API I can hit directly with a script. :-)

I've got 80% of the messages downloaded already, and I think the
files/photos/etc will be easy too. I have it running with a few
seconds delay between requests so it doesn't get blocked.

This will get everything in a database format I can make direct use
of, so I'll see what I can cobble together in terms of an archive and
forum we can all continue to use.

How many of you are still here, and will use such a thing if I create
one?
