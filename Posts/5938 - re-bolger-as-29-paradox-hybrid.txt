Hey Bob,

Thanks for joining in the discussion and sharing information about your meeting up with Chris. I am sure a lot of folks will be interested in hearing about what you decide.

What would be your thoughts on a smaller trailerable Hogfish type hull? Say in the 20 ft. range with room for two to sleep and do some camp cruising in? Schooner rig with roller reefing lug sails? Maybe water ballast.

Maybe something like this with chine runners and a forward centerboard. Slot-top cabin.

Mr. Bolger recently mentioned in an interview that there will be a return to smaller trailerable boats with the present economic climate, i.e. high fuel and slip costs. People tied to their inland jobs but longing to get out on the water occasionally, without the anxiety about leaving your boat unattended to at some marina.

You can clean, maintain, re-stock and provide tlc to your baby right in the driveway.
