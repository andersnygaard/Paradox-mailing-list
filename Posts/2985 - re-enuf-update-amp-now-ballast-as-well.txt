Subject: Re: Enuf Update &amp; now Ballast as well

Hi Derek,

Here is what you wrote previously:

"Finish again! I am going to paint the very bottom red. The reasoning is: I have International Paints red from Caleb,"

I expect it is spelled the same no matter which paint you use.

However,  just "SOS" would do it? 

Now, what advice re. my ballast question?

Derek
