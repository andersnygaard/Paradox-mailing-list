Subject: Getting started

I've got the plans, plywood, some semi-decent fir 2x4s, read 98% of the posts, the epoxy and nails should arrive any day now. My plan is to start with the "appendages": mast, yard, boom, rudder, yuloh, and beams..then proceed to the hull.  Thus far, I've sawed, chiseled, and planed scarph joints for the two side members of the mast.

Thanks to all who have posted building-related questions, and special thanks to those who have taken time to share their experience, advice, and opinions in response to those questions.

I may set a record for taking the longest to build a Paradox.  My main reason for building it is for use after I retire, which is 3 1/2 years away.  Can't imagine I'll take that long, more likely half that time until it's finished.  I plan to enjoy the trip as well as the destination.  That amount of time should be sufficient to come up with a suitable name for my craft..some possiblities: "Windependent" or maybe "Cette Assez" (French: It's Enough.)

Once I've got enough done to be worth taking a look at, anyone whose interested is welcome to a stop by for a firsthand look-see.  I'm located in Kansas City, a mere 15 hour drive from the nearest salt water cruising grounds.
