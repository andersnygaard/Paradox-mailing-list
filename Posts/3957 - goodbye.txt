Subject: Goodbye

I'm leaving the group after about 30 months.

Enuf left for Trondheim via Norfolk today. As she bobbled down the road (council behind on pothole filling again) my wife asked if it made me sad. It didn't. I'm happy that she goes to a new home, I've got a new boat project or two, and a consultant surgeon told me yesterday that a 5 hour op may cure my diabetes. What's to be sad about?

Thanks to everybody for their help during the build. I'd like to particularly single out Al Law, Dave Bolduc, David Beard and Don Elliot.

If my op works (booked in for next March) I may build again. but a lighter, quicker and dirtier build perhaps incorporating some of Jeff Uk's changes and definitely making proper Honda provision :0)

Cheers all ..... Derek
