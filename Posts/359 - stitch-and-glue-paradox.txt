Subject: Stitch and Glue Paradox

Hello,

I am interested in building Paradox using stitch and glue.
I have purchased the plans in which the side panel dimensions
are already called out.  Has anyone developed dimensions for the bottom, or is willing to do so?  I have toyed with using modeling because I do not have the required software.  If anyone has already approached it I would be very interested
in getting the bottom dimensions.

Thanks,
Jeff Forrest
