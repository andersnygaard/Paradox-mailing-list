I find that a Paradox is so heavy, it smashes through chop with no issues, providing you sail on a beam reach first before hardening up to the wind. But in a 2 foot chop tacking through the wind will be impossible, so I resort to gybe tacking. She spins around quick enough doing that. For her weight she's not carrying enough sail to get her going upwind from a standing start in choppy conditions, so to try sailing her off a beach is something I would never contemplate. If you get it wrong and you get washed back onto the sand you won't be going anywhere.

She's definitely a through the water kind of boat, not over the water like a dinghy. I think of her and sail her as if she's a miniature keeler.
