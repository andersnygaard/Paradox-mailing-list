Subject: Re: Finish


Any open weave or pinholes will absorb moisture, dirt, oil, scum, moss and attract the derision of seabirds who will use if for bombing practice:-)

You,ve forgotten that I'm mounting an air gun :0)

And epoxy needs paint to protect it from the sun.

OK - so where you live the third item will not be a problem:-)

Then I also think that when you consider all the effort you put into building something that is of lasting value and will cost a lot to replace why not complete the job to a reasonable standard? And I don't mean a yacht finish. But even a good work boat has a durable finish for the simple reason that it will last longer that way with a lot less annual upkeep.

And here we are back to aesthetics. I studied some work boats in Newlyn recently. Any old paint applied in ever thicker globs over old paint with the rust sometimes chipped away first. 

Cheers, Nels (Who is better offering advice than following his own:-)

Which is why I value your advice :0)
