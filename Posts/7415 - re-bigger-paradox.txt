Hi

no problem for me, it can be heavy, it can have more ballast and i wont chance the Sail, because will go slow, that's the main reason to get a Paradox ! 
I did my homework, I think about that project for over 3 Years now, and i Still think a Paradox is best for me and my way of travel! 
I NEED the space, so it has to be bigger.
Constructive answers would be nice... 
Search for another boat wont help me much!

Regards Chris
