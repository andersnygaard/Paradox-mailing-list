Subject: Re: scaled up Paradox

At 6'2", I've inquired about the larger Paradox, too, but the idea of 
a displacement of over a ton fair takes my breath away.  It's certain 
my minivan couldn't tow it!  I'd much rather knock down the forward 
bulkhead and find a way to raise the cabin top on the stock design a 
few inches.
