Subject: Re: new builder in Oz

Hi Everybody,

My name is Bill, I notice there are a few other Bills on this forum so I'll call myself OzBill.

Welcome aboard Bill.

I got my plans about a week and a half ago, and am taking delivery of some plywood tomorrow.

I live in Brisbane, Australia. While reading through the past messages I see there has been at least one, possibly two Paradoxen(?) built here. Are the owners still on this list?

I have a few questions that I hope some of you may be able to answer.

Q. Can Stainless steel be substituted for the Bronze bits?

Do you mean the ringnails? Can you get SS ringnails?
If cost is very important you could probably get away with galvanized as it is all encapsulated in epoxy, but don't expect it to last as long.

Q. On plan sheet 9, the tack strop spacer pipe reads 1/4" (6mm) inside diameter but 14mm OD. The strop itself is 8mm. Is this just a glitch in the plans or am I missing something important?

I read that as the tack strop (rope) is 6mm inside a 14mm od pipe. 
I used standard (in the UK) 12mm water pipe (because I had some)

Q. Has anyone used sand bags for ballast?

I think Dave has used stones on Little Cruiser to replace used stores. Dave ......?

Q. Is aluminium OK for the lightning rod?

If it is marine grade Al it should be ok. I didn't fit the lightning rod as lightning does not feature very high in the list of dangers around here.

Q. There was a rather heated discussion on the use of steel a while ago, did anyone actually ever build one?

I don't think so, yet.

Hoping for calm nights
