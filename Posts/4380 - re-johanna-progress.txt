Thanks Bill.

I drew the 5mm curvature onto the transom. To be honest it hardly looks worth the hassle! I'll decide when I come to cut it out.
Should Bulkhead 4 also have some curvature?

I had a quick try at bending some deck beams tonight using some scrap ply. To be honest 6mm seems far too small, 12 mm was easily bendable although I think it could have a bit of spring back.
I think I'll use 9mm as the sheet I have for the internal bin sides etc isn't going to be used for some time, and I can replace it further down the line or even use some locally obtained ext grade as those parts aren't structural in any way.

I've decided just to wait till the weekend and pick out some Douglas fir from the local timber yard.

Your pictures of "Faith" look great. It looks like you're almost there. Are you going to remove the windows before painting etc.
I'd hate to get them all spotted with paint and covered in dust!

Another question to Bill. Where did you get the wheels for your makeshift trolley. I expect I'll need something similar so I can move the boat outside on the hot days. It was 30C in my boat shed at the weekend, and it isn't summer yet!

Regards

Pete
