Subject: scaling the boat
Date: Tue, 9 Dec 2003 13:56:03 +0100

Hello,

I am new to this group and hope to build a Paradox during next year. I do not know if I am asking a stupid question now, but wonder if it is possible to scale the boat and make it 20% bigger (longer, wider, higher)? What problems will or can arise? 14 feet seems just a little bit small for two persons sailing (or am I wrong?). I was also wondering how much time and money usually is spent on the building (do not know what to expect)? 

I have always wanted to build a small sail boat and the paradox might be it. Hope someone can give me some points of view. 

Thanks, 

Fredrik
