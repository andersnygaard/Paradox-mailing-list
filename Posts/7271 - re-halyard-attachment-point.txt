Have you seen Matt's diagram that is in the files section?

The halyard fixing point seems to be a bit further aft than on the old sail. Looks like about 1/3rd the way up the yard. Hopefully somebody else can confirm.  I think each sail has to be fine-tuned a bit, maybe several inches either way, depending on how heavy and how much flex in the yard.
