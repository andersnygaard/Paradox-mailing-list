Subject: Re: New guy question about interior finish

I think tinted lexan provides great UV protection, both to paint and the interior cushions.

In that case there is even less need to paint the inside of a Paradox. The only time the sun can get at it is while you are actually sailing and then, depending on how big you are, only what can get past you plugging up the hatch.

Hoping for calm nights
