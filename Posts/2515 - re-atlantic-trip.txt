Nels, 

All I can say is that it does great in open water. Keep in mind however we were not sailing her light ship but loaded to the waterline with all Chris's tools, spares and about a years supply of food for a family of four.

I have up loaded some pictures of her under sail I took in 2001 while sailing together in the Bahamas. They are in the files section under Hogfish Maximus. I was trying to find the ones I have of us tied up together and will post them when I find them.
