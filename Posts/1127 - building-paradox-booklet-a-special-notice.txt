Dear Members,

I am sending this message to all members who have recently ordered the 'Building Paradox Series' booklet.

I regret to inform you that the most recent printing of the Paradox series booklet is missing some pages due to a machine misprint and resorting.

If you have received the booklet and found that Chapter 12 or 13 is missing, please reply to this email with your name and e-mail address, and I will send you the missing pages by email attachment or by mail. 

Please note that Chapter 13 features a drawing of Paradox's righting moment and a sketch of Paradox in waves.

I apologize for any inconvenience caused and will provide the missing pages as soon as possible to correct this situation. Please contact me (by replying to this email) for further details.

Thank you,

Don Elliott
