THe prototype has proven to be successful. Of course it will not work well with chine runners as it is not ballasted so needs the leeboard. I would make a couple of changes. Smaller main and add a mizzzen. Have a standard companionway in the rear of the doghouse so one can sit on the aft deck on a nice day. I think we discussed that at one time?
