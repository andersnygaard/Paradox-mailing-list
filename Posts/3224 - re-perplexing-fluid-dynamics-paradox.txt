Yes - and I assume you you also mean - getting in your Paradox and measuring CFD for real too!

One also must consider that since the research was carried out by "Professor Clive Fletcher and his students at the University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia" that the results would be upside-down, and therefore not totally conclusive. Perhaps all libations have the bubble going down - down under?

A concept that deserves further study by our antipod friends :-)
