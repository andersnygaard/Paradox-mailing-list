Al,
Many thanks for the info.
I've annotated my plans with those measurements for future reference.

I think I'll probably use the router to shape the hatch and cabin 
bits, but that's still some way off!

Perhaps when we get Christmas out of the way, I can start getting 
serious about this build...

Cheers

Pete
