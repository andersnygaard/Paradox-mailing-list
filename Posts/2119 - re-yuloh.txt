Subject: Re: Yuloh

Thanks All, ya DC Im finding out the Yuloh would be handy in a lot of situations, the outboard can be a pain, Like running out of fuel 25 ft from a busy dock with the wind blowing. What wood did you Guys use ? My thought is to use Fir or Pine 1x ' 2 layers. Any advice ?

Matt's new Yuloh is straight, he said it works good, but its a lot harder on the arm and wrist.
