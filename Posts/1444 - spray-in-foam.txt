I've always been interested in high-volume urethane spray-in foam for floatation and insulation. I find the cans of Great Stuff to be tricky to use and unpredictable.  I've used two-part expanding foam that comes in cans, but it didn't rise very much and was very expensive.

Now I've found something that looks pretty good:

www.TekSupply.com  offers several varieties of spray in foam in refrigerant-type large containers with convenient flexible spray hose and nozzle.  I just got their catalog and found several sizes and performance choices on pages 18-19.  They also sell some cool plastic "aircraft hanger" type sheds in varying sizes at reasonable prices, good for build a boat in this winter!

Nope, I don't work for them.
