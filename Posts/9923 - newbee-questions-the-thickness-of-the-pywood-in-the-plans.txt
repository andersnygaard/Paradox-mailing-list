Subject: Newbee questions the thickness of the pywood in the plans

Hi everyone,

I just got the plans for Paradox and am by no means an experienced boatbuilder (i built a canoe and a small sailing dinghy). But I find the thickness of the plywood to be used quite thick. Isn't it over the top to have 12 and 18mm plywood? Could one make it lighter (yet strong) or is there a perfectly good reason to use these heavy sheets? I'm asking because I would like the boat to be a bit less heavy when empty if possible.

Kind regards,

Barry from The Netherlands
