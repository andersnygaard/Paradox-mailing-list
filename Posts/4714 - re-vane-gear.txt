You are right about the boat being easily balanced, and hence the 
need for only minor adjustments of the rudder to hold a course and it 
seems logical to have a separate rudder linked to a windvane.

Glen has overcome the problem of placing the windvane far enough 
behind the sail.

The trouble with mounting a windvane on the bow is that the sail may 
interfere with the windflow and may even prevent the wind reaching 
it. Robin Knox-Johnston mounted windvanes either side of Suhali for 
his world circumnavigation, but that arrangement complicates the 
issue.
