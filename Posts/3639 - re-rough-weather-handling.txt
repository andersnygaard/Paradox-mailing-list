I can't answer all of your questions, but for those I can see below.

It is not a boat that can be built in a couple of months. While I am sure it can be done quicker, mine took 18 months.

I don't understand this question. When the wind is in the sail the boat heels and the chine runner does its stuff.

The worst water I have been in was in a tide race. I was going with the tide, against the wind. Solid water was coming over the cabin.

I usually have the main sheet and the tiller both locked off. Like this the boat will sail itself with little attention. While traversing the above tide race I had no need to make any adjustment to either control. I could hear large quantities of water running off the deck into the vent trunk, but none came into the cabin. 

Hoping for calm nights
