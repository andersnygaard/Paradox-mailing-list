Subject: Re: Grettings! New Paradox inductee here... Need help with Yuloh specs

Jeffrey....  yes I know  "Tardis" is no doubt a very clever name. Who Knows (no pun intended)  lol    I usually just go with what feels right..Still some time before that decision has to be made. Once the boat gets here, she can talk to me and we'll see what suits us both.  :-)

I am just thrilled to death though, about acquiring her. Everyone that has seen Lezlie's work has commented on how "first class" it is. I know I am very lucky and kind of cheating the system a bit by buying a Paradox that someone elses blood sweat and tears have gone into ...but I plan to try to make up for that a little by really using the heck out of her. She will be a big departure from what currently is my "norm"  (www.saildauntless.com) 

Thanks to everyone that responded with info on the Yuloh!
