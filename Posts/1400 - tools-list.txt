Subject: Tools list

Dear all,

I take responsibility for the tools list which has sparked some debate.  It was a list compiled by me of the tools used by Don to build his Paradox.

It was my list, not Don's or any other person's.

If I have done anything I should not have, I apologise, but it seems useful to me and as starting point for all who intend to build a Paradox.
