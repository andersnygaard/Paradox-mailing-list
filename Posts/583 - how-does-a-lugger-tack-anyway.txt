Subject: How does a lugger tack anyway?

Hi all - 

I've been following the discuss on trim and tacking - and reading the plans - and I thought 'How does a lugsail go about anyway?'. In Bermudan and Gunter rigs there is a pivot at the gooseneck and the foot of the yard, to allow the sail to swing round as she goes through the wind.

How do the boom and the top-yard get from one side of the mast to the other with the lugsail rig? They must have to move aft of the mast and then swing over to the new lee side. Does this happen easily or does it require effort from the crew? I just can't picture the transition, there seems to be too much yard forward of the mast. Can anyone describe the manoeuvre in simple steps?
