Subject: Re: Fitting it all in

Well Steve, I come from a different perspective, having sailed on LNG tankers for 4 years earlier in my career <grin>. Of course we had multiple radars, lifeboats, desalinators, etc.

As far as sailing small boats (and my canoe), I have never been out of sight of land but I agree we need to be prepared.

Watermaker - Paradox has a rain catching system to replenish fresh water supplies. I plan to keep one (or more) of those flexible 5 gallon containers of fresh water with me on all my cruises.

VHF radio - They make handheld VHF radios, which survive getting wet. Here is one link: http://www.amazon.com/Standard-Horizon-STD-HX370S-Handheld-Marine/dp/B000GDXNAK

Radar is not needed in my book, although a metalic radar reflector, hung from the mast might be a good idea in crowded waters.

Life raft - Paradox itself would be the liferaft, since with the positive flotation, it will stay afloat.

Take a look at some of the required equipment for the Water Tribe Ultimate Florida Challenge: http://www.watertribe.com/PDF/WaterTribeMarathonRequiredEquipment.pdf

I'm actually leaning toward building Enigma, when Matt makes the plans available. It should be easier and quicker to build, and I can hang it from slings in my garage! I would install some closed cell insullation to make it unsinkable. Have you seen the video of Matt sailing Enigma at: http://link5.streamhoster.com/?u=3Dsteveisaac&amp;p=3D%2FEC2006Wizard_2_Med.wmv&amp;odaid=3D2010
