Subject: Re: Bigger Paradox

John,

Could you please elaborate on this? My understanding so far is that all dimensions can be increased 20%, and then ballast added to put the boat on the original designed waterline, and that Matt Layden has approve this idea. I am one of the others seriously considering building a bigger Paradox. (Maybe none of us really want to be the guinea pig.) :-)

Matt.
