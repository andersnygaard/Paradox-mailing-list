The extra flap of cloth at the top is not the biggest complaint. 
It is the tack angle. the old sail has 91.3 degrees. The new sail has 
95.65 degrees.  So, therefor, when one is furling it up there is a 
chance of rolling up onto the Spool, or something. I remember hearing 
of this somewhere. Don't recall right now. Also I uncovered something 
else at the Sailrite website. When I input the dimensions for the new 
sail on their calculator it calls out only 95.8 square feet of area 
in addition to the tack angle readout. So overall I like the old sail.
Does anyone here know who has the new sail?. If so how do you like it?
