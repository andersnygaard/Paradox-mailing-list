Subject: Construction Questions

I have been a lurker on this group for some while now - and have recently built a 1:5 model of PARADOX.

Two questions on building the real thing. Sheet 3 indicates that bulkhead 1 is watertight, yet sheet 7 gives various options for openings in it? What are the group's opinions on sealing this bulkhead and filling the whole of the section forward of it with foam?

Has anybody considered forming a small anchor well (much like those that John Welsford uses on his boats), self draining and open to the deck, above this forward compartment?

I would be most interested in the pros and cons of these two ideas. I put them forward with some trepidation as it is very hard to find fault with such a well thought out piece of design as the PARADOX.

Best regards,
