BTW, my current boat is not a Paradox - it's a twin-masted Breton lugger, chaloupe-sardiniere rigged with a dipping lug foresail and standing lug main of equal size. I've seen Alistair Law's Paradox, Little Jim, and I'm still mulling as to whether boat no.9 is going to be this intriguing little microcruiser, which is why I've just joined the group.
