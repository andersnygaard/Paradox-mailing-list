I am a new Paradox lover. I am from Quebec Canada and am supposed to receive a set of plans in the nest days. Each days, i go to paradoxbuilders and am very interested by Alastair works and CAD drawings. Impresive. 
I ever build a Weekender, and some sea kayaks. Paradox seams more seaworthy, I always loved small sailboats since 25 years from now. Building them make me love them much more... Thanks

I collected the sail on Friday. Got the boat far enough out of the

By winding on enough rope to fill the reefing spool I was able to 
make the furling work, just, but I don't see it as a practical set-up 
as lowering the sail had to be done in 3 inch steps (and it gave me 
blisters!) So a topping lift it is, and back to the chandlers for a 
double block to go in the vent trunk.

I made a rig with similar geometry to yours, Glen, but a bit simpler. 
The line goes over a mast-head block and then splits to each end 
of the boom. Once I got the lengths right it seemed to work ok.

What size rope are you using? The 6mm suggested in the plans 
seems a tad thin for easy handling.
