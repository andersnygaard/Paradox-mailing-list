Thanks Glen for all the information. I've been thinking about covering "Little Cruiser" in fiberglass before next year's trip, and I wanted to know how you handled the ground plate along with the fiberglassing job. I guess if someone didn't have access to a vacuum pump, they could just as easily use a piece of thin plywood and lots of weight to press the plate down. 

At the moment I almost have all the hardware off the boat, which includes the hatch track which was stuck down with 3M 5200. In order to avoid tearing up the deck while removing all the bonded hardware, I heated up a thin metal spreader with my blow torch and slipped it under each part. For metal parts, I heated the part itself. I think for some applications I like the extra adhesion that the 3M 5200 provides; but for many others it's overkill, and you risk damaging the underlying structure when removing the hardware. 

At the moment I'm thinking of covering the deck and sides with 6 oz glass and the bottom with biaxial/mat glass. I already have these materials on hand since I bought them years ago for this intended purpose. For tricky shapes like the toe rails, I'll probably use several layers of 2-4 oz glass cut on the bias. I've also been kicking around the idea of using a combination of 1.7 oz kevlar with a layer of 2 oz glass over it instead of the 6 oz glass. This fine weave kevlar is extremely abrasion resistant, and the layer of glass over it gives you a little bit to sand into while fairing before hitting the fuzzy kevlar. The only problem with this idea is that 1.7 oz is rather expensive, and my source for cheaper seconds ($11.50 yard at http://johnrsweet.com/Kevlar.html ) is out of the stuff right now. Chances are that I'll only do the rudder and centerboard tip with the kevlar, and finish the rest of the boat in glass.
