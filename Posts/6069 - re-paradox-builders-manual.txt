Hi Richard,

The Don Elliott Paradox Builder's Manual is still available via his widow Wanda Elliott (donelliott@localnet.com).

I obtained a copy recently from Wanda (PDF format @ $14.00 via Paypal).

Please bear in mind that Wanda is having to adjust to her new status, and that therefore your order may take alittle longer to arrive.

Regards,

Mike.
