I am just throwing this out there to see if anyone is interested.

February 29 for 12 hours US central time. The single person who covers the most distance in a stock length Matt Layden Paradox receives a 600 usd prize. No entry fee, it is free. You can be anywhere in the world and participate even if you only have access to fresh water. No gas or electric motor. Either sail or yulah, no being towed on the water, one person to operate the boat throughout the 12 hours.

The basis of this race is to allow someone with a stock paradox to be competitive even if they only have access to a lake. Also to allow everyone to participate so no entry fees and no modifications that someone with limited money would not be able to afford.
