I don't understand what is going on here. 

I am not a boat builder, I only build boats because I want the boat 
and cannot get it any other way. I wanted a Paradox, so I built one 
(I expect it will be the last boat I build). If I had wanted a steel boat 
I would have found a boat designed to be built in steel. What I 
wanted was a Paradox, and Paradox is designed in wood/epoxy, 
so that is what I built.

I have a suspicion that this steel idea is just so much hot air, but if 
any of you are really serious then don't talk about it, go and do it, 
and come back (in a couple of weeks wasn't it?) and tell us how 
well it performed.

In my opinion the Paradox is a silk purse in boating terms, why 
does everyone seem to want to turn it into a sow's ear?

There is no doubt that steel will offer challenges that will have to
be overcome, but no more so than in wood.  Steel or wood is a matter
of personal choice.  If people were afraid to experiment with design
changes we'd all still be using coracles.
