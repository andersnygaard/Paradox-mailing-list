Subject: Paradox Plans?

Hello,

I've been studying the Paradox for years (I posted on the old Yahoo group), and I'm finally retired enough to consider building a boat. However, I've been out of touch with the Paradox community for some time, and no longer have a valid source for plans. Can anyone point me in the right direction?

Thank you.
