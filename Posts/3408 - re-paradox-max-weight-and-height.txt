Subject: re paradox max weight and height

Speaking from the perspective of someone 6ft tall and 260lbs,and that of a non paradox owner (therefore unbiased)I believe I would be very comfortable sailing and sleeping in this boat.During my hour or so test sail(courtesy alopenboat)I was perfectly comfortable alternating between sitting crosslegged on the cabin floor and the helmsmans seat.I also think sleeping would be fine too-the floor is over 3ft wide so you can sleepslightly on the diagonal.As Al mentions,you could easily extend the floor platform forward of the mast,or simply place a bag or something under your feet.

As to stability,compared to any other 14ft boat Ive been on,boarding a paradox feels like stepping onto a pontoon.Admittedly my sail took place in calm water and very light wind,but due to the weight and enclosed nature of the boat I know I would feel secure and in control in any conditions I would be inclined to venture out in.

The detailed design of the boat is superb too.All the controls fall to hand and of course you are facing forward.

It is a very special boat.

Cheers,
Neil
