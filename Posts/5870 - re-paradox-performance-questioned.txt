The most people we've had aboard Little Cruiser was 4, which included one child. Of course this was just for a short time since we were just picking up a friend and her daughter on a nearby beach. I think you have to remember that sharpies were used for fishing and lightering cargo. Therefore, they do seem especially well suited to carrying heavy loads. I think even little Enigma seems to sail better upwind with the extra crew member. By the way, we are planning to return to Cedar Key for the annual gathering MAY 2-3; so if any of you want to get together, just drop us a note beforehand.
