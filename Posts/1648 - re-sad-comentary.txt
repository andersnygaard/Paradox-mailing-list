Yes, they are clenched nails, that are a permanent installation. I read somewhere (Don Elliot's building guide perhaps?) that even though the epoxy may hold, the glue in the ply may give way, and you can't really screw into plywood that well, the screws don't hold well over time, hardwood fine. Clenched nails are stronger than screws, and easier than rivets. There is a technique involved as well in that the ends of the nails are curved back into the wood, not simply bent at a 90 degree angle at the end. Here are instructions:

No, I have never clenched nails, but have made rivets.
