Subject: Roller reefing hull attachment?

Hello everyone,

I have searched the old messages, read the Files and looked at all the photos posted here. But I still am not able to find anything pertaining to how the Paradox roller reefing drum is attached to the boat's hull.

I am considering building a little sand box type sailboat, the PDRacer, and would like to put a lug rig on it with Matt's designed roller reefing drum.

Would any of you great people tell me where I can find such a photo or drawing? Or perhaps send me a close-up photo showing the system mounted on your boat?

I had to sell my beloved Potter 15 because of health reasons and would like to have a small boat building project to fill the time. (this sentence is supposed to make you feel sorry for this old man...and make you want to rush out and take a photo for me! :>))

Best wishes,

Bill Nolen
