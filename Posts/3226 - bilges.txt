Subject: Bilges

Hi All,

I am curious as to how you finished your bilges? Mine are just epoxy coated for now, Thought about dresing them up a bit, painting, varnishing. A good coat of white paint would make them look nice, but would hide any rot that might get started.

Any thoughts on the Subject?

Happy Sailing
