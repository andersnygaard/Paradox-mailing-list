Hi Chris.

If you start by designing the mast to fit inside the boat, then scale up the MK2 sail to fit that, it should prove a good starting point. I think that when you have done that the sail might have to be reduced slightly.

You then have the problem of working out the lead of the sail.

Use the sail plan that came with the drawings of PARADOX to act as a guide.

I did work it out once and I think it was just under 10%. Perhaps I might do it again.

The little grey cells ain't what they use to be.
