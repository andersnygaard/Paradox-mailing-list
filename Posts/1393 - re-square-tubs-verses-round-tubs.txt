You don't need to get uncomfortably dressed Will, just take care. I found years ago when it came time to really get into the glue, like glassing a hull, the best outfit was an old sweatshirt and a pair of hospital scrubs. I've been using the same ones for years and they are really stiff with dried glue in places but so easy to slip on when you need them. I was given a "Wooden Boat" boat builders apron many years ago and it has worked out well too for keeping the sticky stuff off. I would go so far as to say it is the most practical nail apron I've ever worn. Tyvek suits are great,light and airy, but be careful about getting glue on the  zippers.
