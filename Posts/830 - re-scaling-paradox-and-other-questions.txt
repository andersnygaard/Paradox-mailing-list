What about the Cape Dory (Typhoon)? I just heard about one (18 ft, built in '79) but haven't had a chance to check it out.
The flat bottom on the paradox seems like a great feature.

I really like that design, saw it first in Annie Hill's book, Voyaging on a Small Income. I found a used fiberglass sailboat somewhat like it although not a dory, a Tanzer 28, which is my keelboat. But I would also like something for shallow water as well. My boat is fast and seaworthy but not in 3' of water.
