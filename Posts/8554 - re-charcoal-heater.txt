Subject: Re: Charcoal Heater

Thanks Jim.

I plan to go shopping this weekend and see what I can find. I'll check the dollar store first for tiny SS bowls and then the hardware store to see if they have any short scraps of 2 or 3 inch copper pipe.

I think the 2" would probably be plenty for my tiny boat but a slightly bigger heater might still be an option. One candle ISN'T enough to heat my cabin but MAYBE if I could fit a few tea light candles inside the little heater it would be worth a try.

Another idea is to use black iron pipe fittings. Sure it would rust but everything else on this boat is built cheap so it would likely outlast the boat.

P.S. Sorry about your assistant.
