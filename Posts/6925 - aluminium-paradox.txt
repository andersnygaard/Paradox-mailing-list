Subject: Re: [paradoxbuilders] A question about build time vs the Enigma.

i think many would be builders of Paradox are put off by the amount of effort it takes to complete. me for one. so i have been thinking that if i do undertake a build i would use aluminium which is stronger and would, i think, cut down on the time significantly.

I've also been looking at the Enigma 460 and people have completed boats in under half a year and many under a year. Are the construction methods vastly different for these two boats or is it just the lack of shelving and floor framing that makes the Enigma quicker to build.  I like both boats for different reasons but the Paradox is my favorite as it's more suited to cruising.
