Derek,

I've never felt very happy with the decision to ban Don; it jars a bit with the idea of the US being the home of free speech.
Could it not be time to bury the hatchet and invite him back? if you explain why you want to try a particular idea I've found him very helpful.

Personally, I find Nutty Boats hard to stomach so I don't read his posts but I have found that one or two that reply to him are worth reading for their neat turn of phrase.

Best regards,
