Sorry if I gave the impression that the chine RUNNERS add to the waterline length as I did not mean that.

Most sharpies when heeled present a longer narrower hull to the water and that is one of the reasons they sail faster heeled. Perhaps it is not a significant characteristic of Paradox. In many of the photos I see the stern and bow above the water so I just felt it was the case with it as well. Pity:-(
