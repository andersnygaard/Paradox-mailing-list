Thanks Bill, that's very reasonable. I knew that the little Honda didn't burn much fuel, but I didn't know how hard it had to work to move the Paradox. Apparently it doesn't have to work very hard at all.

That little Honda sounds like a pretty nice motor, I'll have to look it up and do some research on it.

Thanks Bill
