Subject: Re: About cat sail for Paradox.

Jimmy,

The rig on Little Cruiser is not a junk sail, but in fact a lug sail like the one found on Paradox except that it has a large roach. Personally speaking, I find that the Paradox sail and the Enigma sail work very well, but if you are looking for a "different" look you could always have one made that way. Matt did this on his Sand Flea, which you can see in the photos section.
