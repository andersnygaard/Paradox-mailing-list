Subject: Re: Making a sail

Stephen Yahn had a sail made with Sailrite and I believe the paradox template is on their website. You have to navigate to Sails/ sail quoting. Scroll down until you find 3 paradox entries... the first one is incorrect I believe Stephen said it was not right. The 2nd listing is the correct stats for the original sail and the 3rd listing is the correct stats for the new sail which I believe is the one Stephen went with. He said that the kit came with good instructions and the sail was not too difficult to put together. Hope this helps.

Has anybody ordered a sail for Paradox to be made through a sail maker? Please share your experience.
