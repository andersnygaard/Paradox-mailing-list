A box will not sit sensibly on the floor resting against the divider because the angle is less than 90 degrees, so heavy chain in a plastic bucket eventually punches out the bottom of the bucket. 

Hi Al, 

Wouldn't it be better to store heavy chain under the floor in the centre of the boat?

This was my available-at-short-notice second anchor and was held down by bungee (which may have contributed to the bucket damage). Hopefully with the floor locker mods this anchor can be stowed somewhere less accessible and can become my get-it-out-when-it-is-really-needed anchor. 

I think the bucket damage happened on the road rather than at sea. 

Hoping for calm nights,
