Totally agree. This thread comes up repeatedly on many small cruiser forums.  I worked in the solar and wind energy research for a time so here are some observations from my experience.

There is not enough deck space on a microcruiser for reliable solar recharging of a deep-cycle battery array for going any distance, let alone the issues of cloud cover, rain, salt spray, poor angle to the sun and the overly exaggerated claims of solar panel sellers.

Wind chargers do not generally work well when one is anchored in a sheltered location. Plus they slow the boat when under way are hard to locate safely on a small boat.

A gas generator is a big pain. They have to be located and vented properly, require a gasoline source and are very noisy. I have one I never will use again. Also requires considerable heavy wiring and connections etc.

Trolling motors are not very powerful with their tiny 2-bladed props compared to even the smallest outboard.  A Suzuki 2.5 made it across the Atlantic one time by a crazy Japanese fellow.  It and the Honda weigh in the order of 30 lb and their is way to connect them to an auxiliary tank vented in the stern.  Captain may have to sit further forward to off-set the weight and a small battery can be located in the bow and connected to solar panel for trickle charging. Today's electronics don't use much electricity.

Could not the smallest OB be located so it doesn't interfere with the main sheet? Seems Paradox might benefit from a boom gallows of some kind to keep the sheet higher above the stern.

Rowing or sculling really gets slowed by underwater appendages as well as the mast overhead,

Going upstream on a large river is not a problem with a small OB and a shallow draft hull. Just stay near shore and actually catch some upstream eddies.
