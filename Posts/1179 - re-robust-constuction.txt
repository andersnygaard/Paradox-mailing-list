The great advantage of building your own boat is that you can build in the features you want from the start. Matt has produced a fantastic design and if you choose to increase or decrease the scantlings as I have you have to accept the consequences.  Likewise choose a different construction method at your own risk.

In the end it is your boat - if you are happy with the construction method that's what is important.  I have no bias against anyone choosing foam sandwich, aluminium, or other material for their Paradox - good boats are made from many materials and different people have different skills and resources.

I think it unlikely that I will have any regrets about building my boat with 16mm ply sides and bottom.   Although Shane Acton sailed around the world in a 9mm ply boat but he was lucky not to loose Shrimpy on the two occasions she was shipwrecked - "Shrimpy" and "Shrimpy sails again".

On the subject of modifications I have just put on my deck and am in the process of sheathing  sides and deck with  dynel and epoxy.   I added a shallow self draining well  midway between frames 1 and 2 so that a sand anchor can be lashed flush to the deck - the projecting part of the anchor pivot sits in the well.  I made a hawse pipe just forward of frame 1 leading into the forepeak out of some standard 65mm PVC plumbing flanges and a 45" elbow.  The cap of the hawse pipe has an aft opening which accepts the shank of the anchor.  A gasket will seal the shank entry.  The shackle, chain and rope are all inside the boat keeping most of the weight low and retaining the clear internal access stem to stern.
