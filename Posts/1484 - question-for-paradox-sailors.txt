Subject: Question for Paradox sailors

I just joined the group because I find the Paradox a fresh and interesting approach to sailboat design, and not just limited to micro-cruising.

The big question: In my mind the most revolutionary feature among the many is the use of the chine runners to improve the effectiveness of the hull sides as lateral plane. The question is, how well do they work? I'm going out on a limb here but I wouldn't expect J-boat pointing, but do they allow reasonable progress to windward? Can someone quantify (if only roughly) how high she will point?

Thanks,
Jake
