It's the blind leading the blind I'm afraid. When I first launched I had a similar problem. I found that moving some ballast aft helped. 

The theory is that if the cg is forward the boat weathercocks nose to wind. By moving it further aft it becomes unstable nose to wind, and wants to weathercock stern to wind. So if you get the nose through the wind it will then fall off onto the new tack.

That is the theory. I thought I had it all sorted last year, but first time out this year I found it hanging up a couple of times. I think it may be that I now have too much ballast after having added more equipment (and an extra anchor) over the winter. I am going to be out next weekend and will play about with adding and removing ballast to see if that is it.

Al, When I tack in light airs she will stop nose dead into the wind. Any suggestions ?
