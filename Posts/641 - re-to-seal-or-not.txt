I guess you're talking about using antifreeze fluid to kill rot.  What I'd do is to make sure everything is clean and dried out well.  Then go ahead and soak any of the rotted wood with unthickened epoxy.  Next you can use wood flour or microballons with epoxy to fill any depressions.  This is what I did on Swamp Thing when she was at my house for repairs.  You can then seal the interior with epoxy (expensive) or just use paint or varnish, which is what I did.
