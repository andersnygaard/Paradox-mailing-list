Alec Jordan tells me the kit should be on its way soon. I know there are mixed feelings about a kit Paradox.

While cruising 'Bumper' from the River Crouch to the Scillies and back http://bills-log.blogspot.com/ Alastair let me try out his 'Little Jim' at Plymouth. That inspired me to want my own Paradox, even more. She sails really well.

Thanks Al.

Bill.
