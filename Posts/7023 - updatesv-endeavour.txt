Subject: UPDATE...s/v ENDEAVOUR

To All My Fellow Paradoxians,

AS PROMISED....I have just posted some updated pics as the hull scarfing has begun, yes the funny looking guy with the belt sander is yours truly and also note a new pic of myself standing next to ENDEAVOUR in a state of "un-dress" as we were trying to get a feel for her overall size....more to follow, and soon....special thanks once again to my wonderful uncle, Mr. William Johnston for taking great pics and being ENDEAVOUR'S #1 fan!

Safe Passages To All,
Greg
