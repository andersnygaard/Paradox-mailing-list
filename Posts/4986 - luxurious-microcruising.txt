Subject: Luxurious microcruising

Good point.

There's a school of cruising that seems to prefer the unadorned hardships that folks traditionally associate with cruising aboard small boats.  You know what I mean... "In my day we slept in a wet sleeping bag and ate biscuits and weevils, and we liked it!"

Not me.  My role model is Blondie Hasler, who sailed across the Atlantic in his bedroom slippers.

It's harder to achieve luxury in a microcruiser, but that should only make the accomplishment sweeter.  

So what constitutes luxury for a microcruiser?
