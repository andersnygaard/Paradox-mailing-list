By fitting a skeg as drawn you have moved the centre of lateral resistance aft which in turn will mean having to move the centre of effort of the sail aft as well, even if this is a new design.
The mast will have to move aft as well. More into the cabin. What about the vent box/mast step? 
Fitting a long skeg/keel as drawn will also alter the lead of the sail as the rudder will be attached directly behind it.
Unless you know what you are doing......Forget it
Apart from giving the boat a greater draught you have not gained anything. It won't sail any better, in fact you may spoil her sailing ability.
Just by altering one thing you end up with having basically a redesign.
One way to get over this is to fit a small centre board forward. But that is more work and an extra hole in the bottom that can jam with small stones.
The thing about PARADOX is her simplicity.
