Subject: Re: water tank / water ballast

Hello Mark,

I know that there are quite a few builders, who made it into storage units and put their water in their in 1,5L water bottles.  I definitely makes sense to do it that way, since you wont have any water leaks from the water tank and you water will be fresher.

Enjoy the build.
