Hi All,

Whisper is almost ready for another paint job. And I'm looking for an alternative to the antifouling paints. Any suggestions? I will be using Interlux Brightsides paint, and was wondering how well that would work below the waterline? (not recommended by Interlux) Also, I'm looking at some of the thin film paints...expensive. I read somewhere that Sven used wax below the waterline on his Bris, does anybody have any experience with this method?

Thanks,

David
