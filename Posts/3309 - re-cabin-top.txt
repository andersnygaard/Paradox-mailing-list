As your intention is to not take `Enuf' into situations where sea 
conditions may have the potential for a total or partial capsize, 
what you propose with the cabin top could add to her attractiveness, 
since the whole of the cabin could be open to sunshine =96 a useful 
feature for UK sailors, since when the sun, in a beneficent mood, 
casts her warm and health-giving rays upon both the just and the 
unjust, occasion of her beneficence could be taken.

However, in my experience I would not deviate from Matt's design 
significantly, because even on sheltered waters the unexpected can 
occur, as was the case when my 22 ft Wharram Hina catamaran was 
capsized by a freak gust of wind that came from nowhere on a 
relatively calm afternoon.

By incorporating an open cabin top and an opening for a washboard 
into `Enuf', her self-righting characteristic would be significantly 
reduced.  Indeed, there would be a positive invitation for water to 
rush into the boat, perhaps flooding her to the extent that even if 
she were to right herself, she would float low on her lines.  
Although buoyancy would be built into her by way of foam insulation, 
she would become more vulnerable.

I once witnessed an Alacrity (small sailing cruiser) knocked down by 
a blast of wind, whereupon she took water into her cockpit and 
cabin, such that she sank within minutes and from good account the 
same happened to a Dragon racing yacht in Torbay.

I leave you to ponder these things before `taking the plunge'.

Bill.
