This is a difficult question to answer really, because our kinds of boats are labours of love. Building Mini is an end in herself for me.

At a wild guess Mini is going to cost around NZD8000 (USD5500) and nearly half of that is going to be for the bespoke trailer. I learned on my last boat that the trailer makes a BIG difference to your enjoyment. If you're constantly fighting with a trailer that isn't right, quite soon you can't be bothered taking her out.

I'm not sure I would contemplate building a Paradox using anything but marine ply and West System epoxy.  A Paradox is a boat I would want to last a long time and if for any reason I had to sell mine, I would want to get something back on it. Don't get me wrong, mine is definitely going to be work boat finish, but if the materials underneath the paint aren't much good, the boat's not going to last very long.

Cheers,

Rob.
