I can tell you my story. I tried to use a straight edge and make the top and bottom members flat or parallel. I used a plane and a belt sander to shape the wood. When I came to screw on the plastic it did not lay down true. It has buckels and bulges here and there. I wish now I had used the plastic itself for the fairing tool. Try to screw it down once without the glue and see how it does. It is a tricky thing to do. Or rather it can be a tricky thing to do.
Good luck
