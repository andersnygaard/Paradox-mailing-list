I didn't keep detailed costs while building, but afterwards I reckoned it came to about 2500ukp. That doesn't include things like anchors or cooker as I had those already. I whittled the cleats from a bit of mahogany.

It doesn't include the trailer either. I went a bit over the top with that, but ended up with what I wanted.

Visit boat jumbles in your area <http://www.boatjumbleassociation.co.uk> for things like anchors, blocks and cleats.

One thing I would recommend is to bite the bullet and buy a 25 litre drum of epoxy. It is much cheaper in bulk, and if you buy a smaller amount the price will almost certainly have risen when you need more.
