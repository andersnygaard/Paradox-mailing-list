Subject: Tack Strop Fork

I feel really pleased with myself today. 

I'd cut a brass fork from 3mm strip and found that I couldn't bend it. I cut the ears off, reassembled it on a threaded rod, and silver soldered it together. The wife had to buy me a Rothenburger brazing gun and MAPPS gas bottle plus six 200mm long silver solder rods. I used about 30mm.

I asked at a plumbers merchant about the gun and they insisted that it wouldn't get hot enough for brazing even though it says brazing gun on the packet. Then I discovered that brass melts at brazing heat and silver soldering is better. I bought the gun from eBay at =A310 less than the plumbers merchants.

Cleaned up the piece and I can hardly see the join! Well chuffed. I reckon there's another hobby here if I can think of something else to silver solder :0)
