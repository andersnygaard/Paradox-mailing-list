Subject: Re: aluminium paradox

Aluminum sheets will come in a large range of sizes so no scarph in the side panels. the parts can be cut with a skill saw. once the pieces are cut a welder can tack it together. expensive labor is limited only to the few hours of sewing the pieces toghther. no toxic mess and lengthy clean up and sanding. the bottom sheet can be much heavier plate (up to quarter inch) to give stiffness and some ballast. the foam panels can be sika flexed to the aluminum without worry about condensation. inside wood can be used in all the areas necessary to human comfort, once the outside is painted with a two part epoxy paint there would be no sign to the casual eye that the boat was made of aluminium. from the many years of bashing around on the west coast in various boats aluminum shines as the toughest material by far, but i have a bias against the aluminum gillnetter which would drive its operators to the edge of bonging insanity, and the aluminum herring punt made a lot of noise pounding over the waves; however the right foam glued with sika flex to the aluminum side panels would deaden the drum i think. aluminum is also very sticky, difficult to slide over fixed rocks. but pebbles, oyster shells and sand ok.

Wow,that make it sounds easy enough !! [;)]
