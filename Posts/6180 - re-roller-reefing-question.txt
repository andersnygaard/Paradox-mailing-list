Subject: Re: Roller reefing question

Al and John,

Thanks for your replies. Actually, John, I was trying to remember the details of the reefing system you used '08 Texas200. I recall that it was very Layden-esque but I couldn't remember if it was exactly like Paradox's or if it was your own variant. I remember thinking it was pretty slick, though. I meant to take pictures but never got around to it. If you have photos I'd love to have another look.

I hope I haven't annoyed anyone by merely asking the question. It's not that I'm second-guessing Matt as much as I'm trying to understand his design.

I've noticed, browsing the Photos section, that there are a number of interpretations out there. The Aussie Paradox appears to have replaced the curved rod/tube with a plywood counterpart. I would be curious to know how that worked.

Also, I asked before about Matt's later incarnation for the Enigma. Same as Paradox or revised? Does anyone know if there are pictures online?

Thanks again,
Kellan
