Hi all,

I wanted to share my experience with using a table saw to rip lumber. Personally, I hardly used mine since I bought my lumber rough cut by the supplier. It just needed cleaning up with a plane. However, it could be essential if you were ripping your own lumber.

In terms of the boat construction, I found that installing the sheer strake and chine logs in several laminations made it easier. As for the bottom, it was easier than anticipated. I started nailing and gluing at the bow and had someone sit on it to pull the last bit down at the stern. Additionally, I made a powered mixer to prepare one batch of epoxy while I was applying the previous one. 

Best, 
Alastair
