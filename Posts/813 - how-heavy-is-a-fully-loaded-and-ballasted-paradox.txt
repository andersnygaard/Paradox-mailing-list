Subject: How heavy is a fully loaded and ballasted Paradox?

Paradox should displace around 1400 lbs when cruising for maximum performance. If she weighs only 1000 lbs her chine runners won't dig in as deeply, and she won't carry sail area as well. When we trailer Little Cruiser (which should happen any day now), she weighs around 1000 - 1100 lbs partially loaded, but once we get in with all our stuff her displacement will be closer to 1600 lbs.

Incidentally, Matt has entered Paradox in the WaterTribe Everglades Challenge 2003 Fort Desoto to Key Largo ~260 miles. He is registered in class 4/open/experimental class. It should be interesting to see how he does. I've been told that he plans to sail to the starting point from his home in Stuart, Florida, and then he will sail back home after the race finishes in Key Largo. You can read more about this event as well as the competitors at http://www.watertribe.com/FloridaEverglades/.

Hoping to be sailing soon !!! Dave
