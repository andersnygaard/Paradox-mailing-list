Dear Glen,

Sorry to hear that my furling system idea did not work. Thanks anyway for giving it a try. So, the question seems to remain open, how Matt furls his sail without the help of a topping lift.

I received an offlist message from a Ken La Rose. Subject : Re: [Paradoxbuilders]Furling system.
This message caused a virus warning and was empty. The two attachments were an empty Excel page and another empty file, both creating (serious) virus warnings.
I tried to answer directly, but my IP couldn't deliver my message, "person unknown"..
So, Ken La Rose, if you're honest, try again after cleaning out the virus and send your post to Paradoxbuilders.. Otherwise, dear group, be warned for this "person".

Best regards,
Bert.
