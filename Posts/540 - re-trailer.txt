I remember seeing a large dinghy at a boat show many years ago that used a similar idea. the tow bar slotted through a hole in the bow and the wheels were lowered like an aircraft undercarriage by winding a handle. Unfortunately they had used standard car suspension parts and I could see that maintenance would be a nightmare.

I also wondered how the boat structure would stand up to the pounding on the road.

The basic principle is sound, however, and I have toyed with the idea of a launching undercarriage (no suspension so much simpler to maintain) with a car transporter type road trailer. When on the trailer the undercarriage could be retracted, lowering the boat onto traditional supports

At one time I was actually thinking of mounting a pair of torsion axles in the boat structure, say at bulkhead #3 in such a way that once launched the axles, with wheels attached, could be unbolted(0r better still unpinned) from inside and then pulled away from the side while the boat was floating. In a similar manner the towbar could be attached to the stem. Wheel/axles and towbar could then be stowed in the tow vehicle until needed again and the mounting ports in the side of the boat and stem could be covered. I still think the idea has merit and I'm sorry I didn't develop itfather.

Thanks,

The drift boat was a good idea, I got some useful ideas and pictures.

Almost all trailers over here use independent rubber-in-compression suspension units. It is rare to see one with leaf springs.

Hi Al,
One of the things I considered was a drift boat type trailer, you might want to do a web search for info on them. I know that they launch them into very shallow rivers from the banks. Another thing to consider would be using torsional axles as they are mounted independently from each other and would allow the bottom of the boat to be below the axle.

Hi all,

I have been bending my mind towards building the trailer for my paradox. Now that the bottom is on I can cart it off to local trailer builders and see what can be done. 

I want to be able to launch/recover off a slip into the water without getting the wheels/brakes wet, and also unload/load it onto a flat surface, such as a beach when the tide is out.

Have either of you got any 'must have' or 'avoid' ideas, before I part with some cash?

Hoping for calm nights
