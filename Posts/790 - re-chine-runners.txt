Their purpose, of course CE, is to prevent lee way while maintaining shallow draft and keeping complex and bulky structures like center board trunks out of the cabins. They were developed by long time micro cruiser Matt Layden who lived aboard and cruised a series of micro cruisers ranging from 12 to 15 ft. He experimented with their shape on scale RC models until he was satisfied. Their use does require a heavy displacement so that they are well under water when heeled. Paradox's draft goes from 9" when upright to aprox. 23" at 30 degrees angle of heel. When you combine this draft with the effects that Al talked about you get a very efficient means of preventing lee way for what you have invested in structure. While building Zoe I was very skeptical of their ability, given their diminutive size, that they could do the job. I personally devoted a lot of time to ensuring the shape was correct and as laid out in the plans to ensure the best performance possible from them. I have not been disappointed. Hope this helps
