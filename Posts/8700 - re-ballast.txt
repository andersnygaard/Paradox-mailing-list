Hi Nick,

You are not the first one tempted to use bermudan rig on Paradox. Here is a photo of one [http://ftp.ij.net/wctss/wctss/photos107.html](http://ftp.ij.net/wctss/wctss/photos107.html), [img]http://ftp.ij.net/wctss/wctss/ftdesoto913web/Paradoxmod2.jpg[/img]

I have earlier done some research on this and found out that first the chinerunners were removed, later a leeboard was attached, so there is no way back. Just for information...

Regards,

Eerik
