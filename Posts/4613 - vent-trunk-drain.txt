Subject: Vent Trunk Drain

Hi,

Matt specifies 1" dia pipe for the VT drain. Here in the good old UK, standard PVC plumbing comes in 22mm, 32mm and 40mm size. I have a length of 22mm left over from my last bathroom refurbishment which I was considering using, but too be honest, it looks a bit small for the job in hand. If one were to ship a load of green water, I could imagine the VT filling up quite quickly. Would a 22mm pipe be adequate to keep the VT empty under such conditions? Should I go for 32mm which I reckon will just about fit if my drilling is accurate enough?

Thanks,
Pete
