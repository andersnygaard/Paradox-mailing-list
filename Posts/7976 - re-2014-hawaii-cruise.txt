Hi Dave,

I really enjoyed your trip report Dave. Thanks. I see you used an autopilot most of the time. Looks like you have solar panels on the hatch top. Were they able to keep up with the load of the autopilot or were you depleting your battery while you were underway?

I was also interested in your comment that Paradox is the most comfortable boat you've had. Was that while you were underway or were you meaning while at anchor?

Cheers,

Rob.
