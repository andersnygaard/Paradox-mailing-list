Has anyone tried using strips of Ultrahigh Molecular Weight (UHMW) Polyethylene on the bottom of his Paradox? It has many of the characteristics of steel. Interstate Plastics sells it in sheets between 1/16 " and 4" thick. It is not UV stabilized, but I've read that it works very well in underwater applications.
