Hi,

My U-bolt is just level with the boat winch on my trailer. Here it is during construction.

It looks off-centre but it's not. More sanding made it look more central. I had a hell of a job getting the ply to bend equally around the bow post. So, I glued it in place and sanded the whole thing square.

The white spots are micro filler and resin, back-filling the holes. I bolted the frame together with thick hex-headed bolts. When dry, I took the bolts out and back-filled the holes, hence the spots. I'm against nails and screws left in hulls, they expand and crack eventually, so no metal in wood.

Where I need screws for fittings, I over-drill the hole size. Back-fill with resin and filler and re-drill to the screw's correct size. So they sit encompassed in resin for life.

Loading onto the trailer is easy, can't imagine wrestling with the boat to push it on?
