Hi all,

So the boat came apart again following it's dry fit and I've been completing as much as possible on the work bench. The key thing for me was to fit the mast in the vent box while I'm able to position it horizontally, rather than leaving it to the end and having to deal with it vertically. It's quite tricky getting everything to fit. 

Decided the best way to avoid the internal wiring from slapping was to attach electrical cable ties every 25cm or so. I've made the bottom hole quite large (16mm), so that I can draw the wire out along with the cable ties in future attached to a draw wire and then repull new wires up the mast attached to a draw wire (that's the theory anyway)! Was going to surround it with tin foil for radar reflectivity, but then learned that tin foil is aluminium and gets eaten in salty conditions, so have opted for an invisibility cloak instead!

I left the right hand side of the mast unglued and lightly screwed, so I could play about with the wiring after making sure the mast fit properly.

Pictures of all this can be found in the album called Mini.

Cheers,

Rob.
