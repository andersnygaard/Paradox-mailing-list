Subject: Re: building material for paradox

Al, you've picqued my curiosity about your mast in the water incident. What were the circumstances/conditions involved? When she shipped the two litres of water was the hatch open or closed? Any lessons learned? Sounds like you have some interesting stories to tell.

Cheers,
Mark

Who was it said "someone starting out sailing knows how big a boat he 
needs, the experienced sailor knows how small a boat he needs"?

Remember Sven is building an ocean crosser while Paradox is designed 
for coastal cruising. Using the foam as Sven does makes for a much 
more expensive boat. Do you need the advantages that extra expense 
gives you? Paradox is extremely rugged, it is far stronger than any 
equivalent sized boat that I have come across. Paradox is also lined 
with foam which gives sufficient buoyancy that it won't sink even if 
full of water.

In 6 years of sailing I have done some silly things. During one of 
these the mast went into the water and about 2 litres of water came 
on board. That is the only time water has come aboard except for the 
odd splash or bit of spray and certainly the only time there has been 
enough water to be able to use anything except a sponge to clear it.

Hoping for calm nights
