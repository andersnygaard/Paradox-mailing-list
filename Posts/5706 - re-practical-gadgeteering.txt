Thanks Bill. That all makes sense. I have a recent review from one of the sailing mags (can't remember which one off hand)where they tested all the 4 stroke 2.5HPs outboards available. The little honda came out well and had the avantage that it's air cooled. Their favourite overall was the Suzuki which had a bit more Umphh (bigger capacity), was quieter (water cooled) and lightest of the water cooled engines. It looks like the cowling is very similar to the Honda. I'll see what's available once I have the funds to buy!
