Subject: When is marine plywood NOT marine plywood?

I have been looking at the myriad of websites relating to marine plywood in order that I might tell for sure that the wood I have been offered is in fact the genuine article.

I have learned that the BS1088 stamp may not be worth the ink it's stamped in.

Please feel free to correct me on this but as I understand it WBP plywood and Marine plywood are both bonded with the same resin glues. And the only difference between the two are that marine ply will have no core voids and all the veneers should the same type of wood and be of an odd number of layers of even thickness.

Of course, playing devils advocate . . . . on the other side of the fence is the arguement that all wood on Paradox is completely encapsulated in glass/epoxy resin and thus not subject to the elements that cause plywood to delaminate and wood to rot! And she will spend 80% of her time high and dry on a trailer in the driveway! 

Sigh!

Can anyone offer advice?

Many thanks in advance from a confused pre boatbuilder
