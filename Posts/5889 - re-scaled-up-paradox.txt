Are there plans available for the Enigma 460? If so where do you get them? Seems like it is still at the prototype stage?

thanks
Jeff

Jeff,

What about Matt's Enigma 460? It is a little over one foot longer than the Paradox, easier/quicker to build, and plenty strong, especially if you use a layer of biax cloth. Check out George's blog to see his building progress" http://e460.blogspot.com/

Dave
