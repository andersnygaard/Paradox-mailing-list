Hello,

I am a potential Paradox builder and have already ordered the plans and book. I would like to get in touch with individual owners in my area to learn more about the design. If possible, could you please post some email addresses?

On another note, I had a great time yesterday sailing my Catalina 22 on Lake Pleasant, north of Phoenix, Arizona. The temperatures were around 80 degrees, with nice winds, and the water was warm enough for a brief swim.

Best regards,

Curtis
