Subject: Re: Dinghy Cruising Meet at Keyhaven next weekend

Thank you Brian, but I've just returned home after a great cruise with Al. We were unable to go to the Scillies, because the weather was not suitable, but we sailed over 140 miles together eastwards from Falmouth. I'm sure both Al and I will publish a accounts. He took some excellent photos. My camera played up, but I may have some photos.

Best wishes,
Bill.
