Subject: Re: Best shape for Chine Runners?

I was thinking of rather moderate incremental changes. If they extended too far out or below the bottom, then of course it would be defeating the whole simple elegance of the original concept. Adding wetted surface is also a big negative, especially in light air or when rowing... definitely wouldn't want to go there. I'm sure Matt's design is very good, and really quite an advance for this type of boat, but that's not to say the chine runners are perfect as is. Obviously he's tried some variations since the original Paradox design. I was curious if anyone knew if he thought the changes helped, or if anyone had made changes they thought improved the performance.
