Hi Al,
How much does Little Jim weigh?
I'd be interseted in knowing your all up weight when trailering.
I think the legal limit in the UK for an unbraked trailer is 750Kgs.
Now I reckon that with no water ballast on board (70 Kgs) and me and my gear (80-90Kgs) that would give a boat weight of 500kgs or less depending on stores onboard. I've eyed up a few trailers which would fit the bill but i'd be interested in your thoughts.
I think Bill trails Faith on an unbraked trailer. It's not that I'm averse to a braked trailer, it's just the extra hassle involved everytime you dip the wheels in the brine!
