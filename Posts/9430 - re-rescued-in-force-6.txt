Hi William,

Hhmmmm. In the situation that I was in it was about lasting out for something like 8 hours in rough conditions. In favour of the outboard it would have helped in terms of making it easier to turn back and return to safety. That would have been a major advantage. The outboard could have helped to get me further out to sea so that we had more room to move. It also would have helped to motor sail so that we could have made headway more quickly.

Adding an outboard is a big decision because once you have an outboard you have to carry fuel, you have a snag problem with the mainsheet. It is really a personal decision. For me the Paradox is about having a simple boat. I like the lack of clutter. I don't have an electrical system. This means I don't worry about a bit of water coming on board. I think this is the philosophy of the Paradox and I have been happy with it so far. Sometimes it takes me quite a long time to get back to my launch ramp because it is usually into the wind. And the final tack is through a lot of moored boats which adds to the challenge. I feel that I have honed my sailing skills and learnt about being patient and accepting the situation I find myself in. There is always more to learn.

Cheers,
