Subject: Re: Plywood for paradox

Good evening Al,

I was hoping that my proposal would be strong enough, I have read somewhere that Matt has received criticisms for over designing Paradox, but in his defence I'd rather be in the stronger boat than the weaker one out in a good blow! :o)

If this arrangement gets off the ground and I get my plywood from this source, all the available sheets are in 9mm. When I get to the point of fitting the bottom, I plan to scarf the first layer and fit as designed. 

With the second layer, I was planning to lay it in 150mm widths at 45 degree from the centre line much like cold molded boats are built. Thus I plan to get around creating unintentional voids at the joint between the layers and hopefully form a very strong bottom panel, then glass the whole lot over as designed.
