Subject: Re: Grettings! New Paradox inductee here... Need help with Yuloh specs

Hi Sean,

On Sheet #12 of the plans, on the right side, Matt gives the measurements for making the yuloh. George van Sickle also made a yuloh when he was building his Enigma 460 and has a few pictures on his blog - http://e460.blogspot.com/2010/07/making-yuloh.html

Good luck. I'm about 2 years behind you in my Enigma build!

Dave
