There are some photos in the files here of these two designs.

Good views of the chine runners and rudder assembly on the 40' Jubilee. Unfortunately no visible details of a centerboard. I think both Bolger and Yrvind feel a bow-centerboard is necessary to maintain headway and balance when using such a large rudder area. (See the write-up in BWAOM re: Dart Dingy and Cartopper.)

Also may help when docking a 40' hull under power. (Bow rudder as well??)

Also Sven Yrvind continues to translate his website over to English.
