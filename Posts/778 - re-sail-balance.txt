Try tis little experiment. get out on the water in a wind and furl your sail so that you are under bare poles does the boat round up into the wind? if it does, I would venture that you have too much ballast foreward. Try it again with the sail raised, but not sheeted in tightand neutral rudder and see what happens. the boat should not round up into the wind.try mooving ballast aft.
