It mostly becomes an issue when collisions occur; then the assignment of blame becomes a matter of proper warning versus a proper lookout.  One of the beauties of shallow draft boats is anchoring in locations that exclude  boats of deeper draft from proximity.

Down here in Florida I a used Kerosene anchor
light almost every night for several years and only on two (i think)
occasions did the CG say anything. Their comment was that is was
illegal because it was not white but yellow sort of. Also blocked
partially by the mast. BUT never a ticket or even a warning. They did
comment that they were glad we had some sort of anchor light. In one
instance we could see probably 200 boats and about 10 had anchor
lights.  Tom on Sandpiper
