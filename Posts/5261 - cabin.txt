Progress. I've been working on the cabin now that the fiberglassing is done. And I'm looking at Dwg. 10 the trim piece/drip rail, 2mm x 75mm. Do I need those? I suppose there is condensation on the windows overnight. I have made the mold for laminating the cabin and hatch beams. I also made up one lamination in it. Tomarrow I'll see how much springback there is to it. Cheers for now. Steve Yahn
