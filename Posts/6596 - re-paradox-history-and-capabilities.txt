The Paradox stability curve shows it should self right anywhere up to 165 degrees, that's 15 degrees short of fully inverted.

I got some friends to pull my Paradox over (in full sailing trim) till the water was approaching the edge of the hatch. they attempted to measure the load required at the masthead to keep it there. Unfortunately the spring balance I gave them only went up to 25 pounds. The measured result was "well over 25 pounds". Moving about inside had no noticeable effect.
