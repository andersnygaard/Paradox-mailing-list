Subject: Re: Time to build and cost?

It cost about 2500UKP and took me about 18 months of evenings and weekends, fairly continuous building, with just the odd week off.

W O W !!

That's a LOT of work!
With that kind of time frame, it should take ME about 6-10 years.

What could be done to shorten this timeframe?  I just want a solid, safe boat that sails well and doesn't need to live in the water (no more than a few days at a time, probably)

I know I could get away without 'glassing the hull, and I cut back on finishing the interior, stressing function over form.  Paint vs. varnish, galvanized hardware instead of brass, etc.

I'm not even against using ROOFING TAR for waterproofing.  If it's good enough for the ancient ships, it's good enough for me.

So seriously, if you had to build one in a week, no matter what it looked like in the end, could you?  A month?  Two months??  What bits took the most time and/or expense?

I'd like to be sailing a Paradox-like craft by next summer, and I have maybe an hour or two each weekday plus maybe 4 hours each weekend day.

I'm willing to break from modern convention but I don't want to sacrifice safety.
