Congrats Chris, Keep us informed on how it goes. As for me, I'm still embroiled in finishing details before painting, they seem to go on forever.

Just to let the group know,

I have started building my Paradox here in Brisbane, Australia. Got 2 
9mm (3/8") panels this weekend and have started cutting out 
bulkheads. I made a 1:10 scale model of all the components to see how 
they go together (cleats, chine logs etc) and this has helped a lot 
in visualising it.

Can't work on her this weekend, I'm working all this week and through 
to next week, but hopefully I can get stuck in on my days off next 
week. 

She's going to be called Walden when I finish her.

Chris
