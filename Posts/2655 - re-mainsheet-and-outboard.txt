Subject: Re: Mainsheet and outboard

Dave. In your photos of LITTLE CRUISER there is a pipe coming from on deck and going to the outboard. Is this just a standard fuel line from a tank with a squeezy bulb allowing the motor to draw the fuel its self as needed or some other way for refueling the motor?

The fuel line went directly to our old 4 hp Evinrude motor, and it required no pumping. Now we have a 3.3 hp Mercury engine which requires pumping every hour.

By the way, we do carry additional ballast forward to compensate for the motor weight.
