Kellan,

My roller boom was functionally like Layden's.  I used my own means and methods and wasted a couple of weeks.  If I were to do it again it would be like his.  I have gained even more respect for his work, if that is possible.
Sand Flea is very very simple but would only work on that size boat and deck arrangement.

OK, I found Dave &amp; Mindy's YouTube demonstrations of Enigma's reefing. Seeing the furler in use really helped clarify what's going on. I also see that Matt kept the design pretty much the same from Paradox to Enigma, so he must have been pretty happy with the system. Sorry if I've been a pest.
