Subject: Chine runner efficiency.

I've read Sven Yrvind's article regarding Paradox's windward performance, and have seen the photographs of Zoe - CR1 and CR2 - showing the chine runners. They are much smaller and 'stubby' than I had imagined - I'd assumed that these would be at least 6 inches wide, and maybe more, in order to really 'dig in' when heeled.

Does anyone know whether any documented trials have been conducted to establish the width of runners vs leeway efficiency?

I'm considering fitting chine runners to a St Pierre dory to improve its sailing characteristics whilst retaining its shallow draft and beachability.
