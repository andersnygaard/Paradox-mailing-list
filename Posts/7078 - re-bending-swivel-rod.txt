Subject: Re: Bending swivel rod

Hi Bobby,

(I started a Paradox long ago but ran out of funds.)

Yet concerning bending brass of the indicated thickness is very simple: you heat the area to be bent with a blow torch (like the ones you use to braze copper tubing), when it is red hot it bends like easy.
 
Did you remember to lath in the retaining bolt slit before you bent it? IT is easy to machine the groove (at home) when the rod is straight.
