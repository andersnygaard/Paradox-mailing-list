This is an opportunity to thank all you guys who have encouraged and helped me with building 'Faith'.  Thank you for answering my questions about the building process and about the nature of Paradox when on the water - how she performs.

I especially want to say thank you to Al, because without his enthusiasm and his generosity in letting me sail 'Little Jim' I would never have built my own Paradox.

I'm sure the boat will be exactly right for my retirement and most likely the ultimate boat for me.  If I ever build another boat it will be an ultra-lightweight paddling canoe.

Now I am looking forward to having adventures in a great little boat designed by 'Wizard', the genius Matt Layden.  Thank you Matt for your super drawings and all the research you put into designing Paradox.

Thanks to Glen, Dave and all the others who have spurred me on.

Best wishes,
Bill.
