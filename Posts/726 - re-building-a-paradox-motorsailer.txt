Subject: Re: Building a Paradox (motorsailer?)

Hi Al,

I also really enjoyed your photos and CAD images. I know very little about CAD and was wondering if you can do any "modifications" to the original design with that program? Or would it be too much effort?

If I built a Paradox it would be for inland use and in some cases traveling through built up areas along rivers and shorelines. Therefor I was dreaming about a bit of a "motorsailer" version. This would involve adding about three feet to the stern in the form of a "slipper" stern like Bolger's Sneakeasy. This would provide extra bouyancey aft and enclose a small 4 stroke motor.

I would also consider relocating the aftmost bulkhead to where the last deck beam is now located, and extending the cabin that far also. I might also raise the aft section of the cabin about a foot or install a pram hood to keep rain out of the cockpit when motoring. (I don't understand how a person is able to view the sail when the hatch is closed??)

This extra space would give room for a porta potti and an extra house battery in the forward area, therby re-balancing the weight moved aft by these other modifications.

Another modification might be to have the mast on a pedestal for going under bridges using a forestay to raise and lower it. This also opens the option of a self furling  jib! It would then become a canal cruiser as well!

Okay - I've had too much coffee today:-)
