Subject: Re: Hello, beginner logistics question and rowing thoughts

I browsed around here and found this photo:

If that link doesn't work, the picture is:

  Photo Albums > Aussie Paradox  > Floating showing ground plate

Based on that, it looks pretty doable to me, possibly even without 
extensions (though getting oars out of the water beween strokes might 
require that). Between that and the pictures of people standing beside 
their boats, I am also pretty sure it will fit in my covered space.
