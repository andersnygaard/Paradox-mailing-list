Hi Eerik,

Thanks for your input. You were right, the bilge and tank dividers did need to go in first. If I had put the bottom on and then tried to put the dividers in afterwards, I wouldn't have been able to do it.

I know lots of others have said it before, but this is one hellava overbuilt boat. It weighs a "ton" already and I haven't put the bottom on yet! My previous much lighter boat sailed over the water rather than through it. I've got the feeling the sensation when inside this one is going to be quite different from what I'm used to.

Cheers,
Rob.
