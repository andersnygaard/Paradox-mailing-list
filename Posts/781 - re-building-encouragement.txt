Great to hear it went so well, reading about it is almost as good as doing it.        It started to snow today :-(

Cabin heat has been a hot topic (couldn't resist the pun) on the micro cruiser group and I can contribute the following: the temp. Friday night was in the low thirties so after the cabin cooled off from the effects of preparing dinner I placed my clay flower pot on the stove and ran it for about five min., which was all I could stand and while I didn't time the cool down the cabin stayed comfortable for some length of time as I read before turning in. I have a down sleeping bag and was snug as a bug in a rug throughout the night. 

Have you got the insulation fitted?

There was a lot of condensation on the windows and overhead the next morning, which was easily removed with an "Absorber" (synthetic chamois). I had plugged all the vent openings and I'm sure this contributed greatly to the problem.

I have been wondering about condensation as it is a problem on my other boat. Do you think it would be a good idea to leave a channel in the window frame at the bottom, under the Lexan, so that condensation that ran off the window had somewhere to go?

Hoping for calm nights
