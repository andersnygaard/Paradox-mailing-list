Bill, 

Thanks for your posting. I am following your blog and attempting to track your progress on Google earth. It is great fun to follow you (while staying warm and dry). 

I'm doing like wise.
It's a great diversion from work.
This is where I think he's been so far (on Google Earth).

I'm not so sure about whether Bill traveled down the Roach and Middleway on day 2. High water would have been about 11:30 and according to my charts, the bridge at Havengore opens 2 hours each side of HW, so it's a possibility to go that way and over the sands before the water disappears (I think).

Keep up the good work Bill!

Pete
