Paradox can be a very low (human) energy boat to own. 

The trailer is left attached to the car at all times, so there is no manhandling. I run the trailer to the water's edge and ease the boat into the water, or winch it out. Even on a beach I have always found enough water close to the shore so that the wheels don't need to get wet.

When sailing, the most energetic part is hauling on the halyard.

Last summer, in a cold force 5, while I was tacking up a channel, a wet man shot past in an open dinghy and shouted something about armchair sailors. I think he must have seen my coffee mug.
