On a similar subject, I was going to order the ring nails from 
Robbins at the same time. Matt specifies 2 lbs of 2-1/2" #10.
Robbins do not appear to carry 2n1/2 by 10s. Once you go to that 
length they nails are #8s. That sounds like quite a beast of a nail, 
and I wonder if it's really necessary. I was thinking of just 
ordering another kilo of 50mm #10 instead. I expect these are only 
used for attaching the bottom. Are Matts estimates close to reality? 
(assuming you used nails at all (I know that Glen didn't)

I bought from Robbins and used the 2.5 #8.

The quantities are about right. I have more of the 1.25" left than 
any of the other sizes.
