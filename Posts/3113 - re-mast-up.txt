Nice, does it fit inside ok? Or are you not storing it inside?

I probably will store it inside because I have been aworrying since someone wrote about the mast takers at motorway service areas. However, I haven't tried it through the hole yet (hadn't thought of it) and I'm hoping to be able to cut a bit off when I've adjusted for the sail, etc..

I have discovered today that the head sleeve of my sail hasn't got a cut out for the halyard fastening! Not to worry, I'll cut it myself and trim it with leather.

Just in case it should snap off at any time I can report that it is possible to scull 3.25 nM without any immediate suffering (No wind this morning, and I had to be home for lunch!)

Sounds like a motor job to me!

There was a fishing boat droning away at the other side of the harbour, even I wouldn't do that to a perfect morning.

In fact there were two of us, the other guy had a motor, and was going all the way to Redcliff (another 3-4 miles) and he elected to row too (though just after I reached the slip a breeze sprang up and I noticed that he had hoist his sail).

Hoping for calm nights
