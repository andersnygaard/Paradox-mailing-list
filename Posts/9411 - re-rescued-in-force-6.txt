Hi John,

I was not very far offshore. A drogue would have helped but only for a couple of hours and then I would have been very close to the lee shore which is completely exposed to the open ocean.

I think the chine runners are as good as it gets on a small boat. The main challenge is sailing into a substantial sea with a small boat. I previously owned a 25 foot Vertue and it was hard work too. Of course I would have been better off in the very substantial Vertue (4 tonnes), but it would still have been tough.

I thought that it was useful to heave to. I was quite comfortable and it felt safe. The main concern was for the rudder. There were some loud noises from that end. I think we were pushed backwards by some of the bigger waves and this put strain on the rudder. Rudders work hard and must be as strong as you can make them.
