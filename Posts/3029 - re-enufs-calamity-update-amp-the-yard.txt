Structurally it is a double cantilever. As you move away from the

thinner. If the load is correctly matched to the varying stiffness 
then the top of the sail will have a constant curvature.

If it's a double cantilever then it's back to the Douglas Fir! Actually I'm not sure what a double cantilever is but a bamboo spar isn't going to be one and as Jack said will need lining up with the mast.

A shelf bracket (or mast) is a single cantilever, a seesaw is a 
double cantilever (2 ends). The Forth rail bridge is a series of 
double cantilevers (http://www.geo.ed.ac.uk/scotgaz/features/featurefirst1053.html). 
Bamboo may well work, but would probably need strengthening to 
prevent crushing where it presses against the mast
