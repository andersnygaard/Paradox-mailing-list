Hi David,

I once used exterior house paint on an old brown tri and got very good service out of it. It held up for the three years we lived aboard her and was sure easy to patch up dings and scratches. Of course, it doesn't hold a gloss for as long and it is a bit of a bummer to remove should you decide to repaint with something other than latex in the future. I don't know if you can even find oil-based house paints anymore, but that would be better and last longer then latex. Also, West Marine's SEA GLOSS is pretty cheap for the quality.

When I painted "Zoe," I only used a quart of Awlgrip so you shouldn't need much. If you roll and tip, the secret is to put on very thin coats (three); you will get a very smooth surface and reduce the risk of runs. Everyone who has seen "Zoe" thinks the paint was sprayed on (would have been a lot faster). Figure one coat a day to roll and tip.

Hope this helps. By the way, while on my test sail, I jury-rigged a topping lift to help in the roller furling department. It worked great. Have you had any luck with your furling?

Tailwinds,

Glen
