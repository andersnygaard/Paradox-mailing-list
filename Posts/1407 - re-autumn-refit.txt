Thanks for the wonderful post, Al.

I have been eyeballing those bottomless bins myself. Sounds like
you've found a good solution.

While you've been reefed, have you felt the need to contain the yard
with a parrel? The photos of Paradox, reefed down, show her yard to be
waaayyyy out there. I know that a parrel would prevent the immediate
stowage of the furled sail on the side deck, but so does a topping lift.

Are you still using the endless halyard/reefing line arrangement? If
so, how is it working out? Have you had any trouble with the line
twisting up?
