As I mentioned before the original setup with 1/4" lexan is plenty strong for the job. Matt had this setup on three boats,(Terrapin, Little Cruiser and Paradox), and they all served the purpose well, giving excellent visibility and durability throughout the thousands of miles that he sailed them. More impressive is the fact that Little Cruiser was hit about ten years ago in the port windows by a 17' skiff that was traveling at around 15 knots down a narrow creek. Since there was only room for one boat in that creek, the powerboat bounced off our heavier cruiser, and it flew into the mangroves. Luckily nobody was hurt. The primary contact was between the powerboat's rubrail and our windows. The windows remained intact and only suffered a mean rub mark which we buffed mostly off.  All I can say is the 1/4" lexan is plenty strong. As for the celotex, it is yellow with a foil back.  The only problem that we've had with it was when a colony of ants moved in and made their home inside.  It took a while to get rid of them.  In regards to the plywood, I would just use fir marine grade wood for the hull and be done with it. Seal it with epoxy inside and apply fiberglass outside, and you should be fine.  Lastly, the automatic "anchor" light I mentioned isn't really intended to be legal. It's just something I'm putting together so that we can find our boat in the dark after we've forgotten to put the masthead light on and we've been partying ashore or on someone else's boat.  Since the light is mounted at deck level, it's easier for us to find it than those lights mounted high up that can be mistaken for stars.
