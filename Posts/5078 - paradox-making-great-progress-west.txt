Subject: paradox making great progress west

So there I was in my 19 foot mirror offshore on one leg of my UK circumnavigation - five miles off the coast of Sussex.

I saw what I at first took to be a lobster pot marker.

"No, it's moving," I thought.

It's a sail - a square rig. A big old boat.

No, it's a small boat close up.

It was a paradox making excellent progress.

Who was it? Where were they heading? How did they cope in the force six squall that hit us later that day?
