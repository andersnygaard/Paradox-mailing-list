Incidentally, I'm sending this message by the email, rather than via my computer's browser, because the new Yahoo version does not allow me send messages, either by my desktop computer or my iPhone. The 'New Topic' button does not work for my Vista browser; nor does the 'Reply' button for responding to messages.

Cheers,
Bill.
