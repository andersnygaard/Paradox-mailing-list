File        : /Rob's Pump Fill and Empty Solution/Plumbing Unstored.jpg
Uploaded by : creditscorenz <creditscorenz@yahoo.com.au>
Description : To reverse the flow direction the Y valves must be reversed. Based on the flow observed (7.6 litres per minute at 2.6 amps), I estimate it would approximately 10 minutes to fill or empty both tanks.
