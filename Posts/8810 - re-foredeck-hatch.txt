Subject: Re: Foredeck Hatch?

I've been in and out of there quite a bit on my build. The interior is finished, painted and fitted out and I'm working on the cabin top now (dunno what's going on, but the closer I get to completion the slower my progress)!

I find that I have to commit to lying on either one side or the other before I head forward. I've installed LED lights forward of bulkheads 1 and 2 and that makes a big difference to my comfort level with lots of light everywhere.

I reckon the sole hatch between bulkheads 1 and 2 helps with access, since it raises you off the floor enough to be able to easily get at the battery and look into the forepeak. I ended up installing my ballast tanks pump under the sole hatch, just forward of bulkhead 2, but I know that others have done away with the sole hatch, so that they can stow larger items forward.

I can see why a foredeck hatch has some appeal, but at the same time with no hatch, it should always stay quite dry forward (I suspect keeping dry could become a big issue on a long trip). My plan is to mount my solar panel on the foredeck which wouldn't be possible with a foredeck hatch.

Cheers,

Rob.
