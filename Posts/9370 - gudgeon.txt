Hi All,

This morning I wanted to make the gudgeon out of epoxy and I used micro fibres and fibres of glass matting. I mixed 250ml in a large container.

The result is as shown on the photo. The epoxy mix heated up and bubbled out the mold.

(outside temperature is 21C)

Any suggestions what went wrong?

Kind Regards
