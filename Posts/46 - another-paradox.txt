Subject: Another Paradox

Just to let the group know,

I have started building my Paradox here in Brisbane, Australia. Got 2 9mm (3/8") panels this weekend and have started cutting out bulkheads. I made a 1:10 scale model of all the components to see how they go together (cleats, chine logs etc) and this has helped a lot in visualising it.

Can't work on her this weekend, I'm working all this week and through to next week, but hopefully I can get stuck in on my days off next week. 

She's going to be called Walden when I finish her.

Chris
