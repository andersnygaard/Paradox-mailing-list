Has anybody used the freshwater tanks as sea water ballast tanks?
Allow them to flood as you launch and drain/pump out on recovery? Is it feasible? Any thoughts or opinions? 70 litres of fresh water for a European solo sailor seems a little excessive and Alistair? has said that it can be difficult to find a convenient hosepipe. I am planning to use a couple of those 10 litre bladders that have a tap and a hanging handle. Cheers.....Derek

Funnily enough, only this weekend I was pondering the idea of self flooding ballast tanks. It should be feasible, the tank is below water level. But make sure your inspection hatches are really watertight!

I carry my drinking water in 2 litre fizzy drinks bottles. I mark them on the outside in mug sized divisions so that I can always put just the right amount of water in the kettle. In an emergency they can double as fenders.

I would never have a cavity like that that I couldn't inspect, You never know what may be living in there! :->

My thought was to have a permanently open hole at the aft end of each tank and a plug on enlarged air vents. 

Launch, pull plug till full, replace plug to prevent in/out flow in rough conditions.

On recovery, pull plug and let it drain as it comes onto the trailer.

Nice and simple, little to go wrong.

I have also been considering a draining anchor well in the rear deck as I still haven't sorted a good way to stow the anchor.
