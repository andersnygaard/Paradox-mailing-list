Normally this is accomplished with fiberglass tape and glue from inside. It is not nailed through the hull into the edges of the plywood bulkheads. Nowhere have I seen that in any recent boat plans. Those that did so, nailed through ribs to bulkheads which had wood framing, before the outer skin was put on.
