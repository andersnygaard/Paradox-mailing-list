I redrew the side view of Gorfnik and added the window. New picture posted in Gorfnik album.

I put a radius on the front part of the window which I now see was wrong but what I was questioning was the location from the top. As I have it drawn now, the window starts at the bottom of the 1" top support. Was that right?

It took me a while to figure out the 1" x 1-1/4" added pieces along the back top of the cabin but finally realized that you took the 1/4" plywood into consideration.

This making up plans is a little harder than I expected. It's hard to describe in words and pictures how all of the parts fit considering some are inside the air box and some are inside the boat. I'm pretty sure it will be worth the trouble though. I know I can't be the only one seriously considering this design and I'll bet others would be built if there was plans available. Especially FREE plans.
