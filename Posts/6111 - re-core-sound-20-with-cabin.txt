Rick,
I posted pictures of my cabin at messing-about.com.  Here is a URL to the topic: http://www.messing-about.com/forums/index.php?topic=3D6856.msg59997#msg59997

Of those who have put cabins on Core Sounds, mine was probably the most work and poorest design, since it was "after-market": I wasn't certain I wanted a permanent house until a couple of seasons into sailing her.  Others with cabins also post there; look up Paul Stewart, who built Dawn Patrol with his son for the Water Tribe Everglades Challenge, and Sitearch, who has made interesting changes to adapt the design to sail in Alaska.

Curious why you think Bellhaven is too much boat?  If I'd known then what I know now I'd probably have built Graham's Bellhaven, instead.
