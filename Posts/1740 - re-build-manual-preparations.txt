DC;

After sending the post, I realized I might have come across a bit more strident than intended. I apologize for any ruffled feathers.

I think it's important to keep in mind that many builders may be first timers and a long tool list would have a considerable deterent efffect. Emphasizing the minimum and offering up the "nice to have" and "luxury" levels of tools makes sense to me in that context.
