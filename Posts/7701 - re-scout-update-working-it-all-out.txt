John where do your sail? I've cruised from New York to the Florida Keys. 
I always use the anchor ball, because then I've done my duty and when 
someone hits my boat it's their fault. I've been asked by other boaters 
many times what the ball was. But never have seen any other suddenly 
sprout up around the anchorage:)
