Hello,

I don't know if I'm the Matt you are referring to. My scale model remains only partly built. I got tangled up with a little old carvel planked double ender at 1:1 scale, so I'm a bit side tracked. :-)

I was building a balsa model from the full plans, it's quite small (1:15) because I wanted to keep it on my desk. It's going together fine with cyanoacrylate glue with an occasional drop of epoxy on some joints later to make them nice and strong. I found it still needed many of the details such as sheer clamps to get the side panels to lay fair. It's easy to build, though. I didn't go crazy with the fit and finish of the balsa parts because it will be painted. My goal is to ballast it and make it sail, but not R/C.

Best regards,
Matt
