Al,

That article was a copy of my account in the DCA magazine. I didn't expect to find it in MAIB, but it was good publicity for promoting interest in Paradox and the DCA. There's a jolly good photo of you and 'Little Jim' at Porthloo beach and another of both Paradoxes at the same beach. There's a good photo of you at Exmouth when you called over to meet me.

Bill.
