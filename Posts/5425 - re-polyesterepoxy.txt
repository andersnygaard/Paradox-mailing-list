Hi Alberto,

Epoxy works best on bare clean wood - that is why it is such a good
glue. It will stick to some polyester resins no problem but not as
good as to bare would. 

Most polyester resins leave a wax on the surface and it must be
removed or the epoxy will not adhere to it at all!

No matter how much you dilute polyester resin it doesn't impregnate
the wood anyway, only the solvent does.

If I could not afford epoxy I would use polyester resin to glass the
bottom up to the waterline and then paint the rest. 

Better to invest in good paint than use polyester resin which is not
designed for use on wood.
