Whatever the law states I wouldn't like to try to manhandle my boat without brakes. The first slope we hit would result in a runaway.


It is all options. If you can't drop your boat onto the ground then it is stuck on the trailer. It is often useful for trailer maintenance to have the boat off.


No tipping, just a rigid (and therefore heavy) platform. The back of the trailer lines up with the back of the boat when properly stowed. This means that when the wheels are at the water's edge the back of the trailer is over water deep enough for the boat to float.


The boat is so over designed that damage to my own boat is rarely a consideration. If you are intending to winch the boat on get a winch several sizes up from what would appear to be needed. Mine is a 900kg winch and the gearing makes it easy to haul the boat on.
