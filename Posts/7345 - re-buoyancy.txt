Hello Dave

Snap - as they say here. 
My Paradox came without foam floatation as Bill decided not to fit any
while building. I can appreciate why, as it would take up a lot of
valuable storage/living space, if there were to be a useful amount.

I was surprised how unobtrusive the foam floatation was. I lined the 
sides and under deck with polystyrene, enough to float the boat when 
full of water. It certainly hasn't limited my storage.

I'm always adding stuff to the boat's inventory, because I'm sure it
will come in useful one day, but not very good at taking stuff out, so
the boat is getting heavier. 

Just take out some of the lead ballast, I'm down to less than 100 
pounds now.

So it would be an interesting exercise to try and calculate or guess
how much emergency buoyancy would be appropriate insurance for if the
boat was holed in a collision. You'd need the flooded boat to float
pretty high up , so the tiller slot was well above the waves if there
was to be any chance of bailing her out.

Well, assuming nothing on board floats, except the skipper (worst 
case). At 640kg displacement, less 70kg water ballast and 80kg (?) 
skipper that leaves 490 litres of air to stop to boat submerging.

Best case: Lightly loaded boat where everything on board floats 
except the 180kg ballast. 180 litres of air will keep you afloat.

Somewhere in between is probably what is needed.
