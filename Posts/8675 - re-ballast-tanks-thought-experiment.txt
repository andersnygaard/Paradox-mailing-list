Hi Guys,

Thank you for your different thoughts on the water ballast tanks. I've now accepted that I must install the breather vents into the mast vent trunk and I don't want to deviate from the plans, if I can avoid it, so I'll probably end up doing it the way the plans say.

Just now, I've noticed that... nowhere on the plans does the vinyl pipe exit onto the deck (the idea of filling the tanks with rainwater from the deck must have come from somewhere else - perhaps Don Elliot's building manual). Wish I'd noticed that earlier!

If I ditch the deck exits this whole tank thing becomes much more logical. All I need is a normal garden hose snap attachment fitting inside the boat with a manual on/off valve along with another two garden hoses with 12v self priming pump in the middle. Orient one way to fill. Swap it the other way to empty. Simple!

Cheers,

Rob.
