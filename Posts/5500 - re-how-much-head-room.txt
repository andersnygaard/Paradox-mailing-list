dumbed down??........I take a little bit of offense to that.  Any boat is what you make of it.  Its up to the builder whether or not to include the details that he may or may not want.  The only reason the paradox plans are unique is because the plans already included details from where to sit all the way to how you should wipe your butt.  Robbsboat could be fitted out to be just as detailed as the paradox.  Robb

Hello Bryan.   You may also want to look at the Michalak Robbsboat.
It has dimensions very close to the paradox, in fact it is a dumbed
down paradox clone.   It could be built more quickly, and much
cheaper.  It has 42" of "headroom".  Now, it's not as fancy as the
paradox, or as pretty, but very close none the less.
