I don't want to argue, just give advice FWIW

-Most stitch and glue builders concluded long ago that anything less than rated marine ply is not worth building into a boat, but the paradox design seems to attract hardware store builders.

-At this time, you really need to get a quote because quality wood might have doubled from builders past experience due to supply/demand imbalance.

If you can get a Paradox built well in rated marine ply and epoxy it is very likely cheaper than you will be able to build in the next year or two. In lesser materials my advice is avoid.

It might be time to redesign the Paradox to normal scantlings. It's way overbuilt and wood has become expensive.
