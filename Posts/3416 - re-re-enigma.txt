Looking at the Matts video one thing has struck me.
Enigma's mast step appears to be a plastic tube, about 3" high, faired and glassed to the bottom panel. She is not then fitted with a cabin/cockpit sole.
The crew seems just to sit on the floor/bottom panel.
If I am right this would save a few pounds in weight.
Anyone else notice that?
