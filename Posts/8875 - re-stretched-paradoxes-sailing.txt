Subject: Re: Stretched Paradoxes Sailing?

Matt  and Jim agreed that Jims designs don't have a deep enough chine for
chine runners to work. It takes a deeper hull to get enough lateral
resistance with the chine runners. Matt recommends that there should be a 1
to 4 or 5 relation between depth of chine and width of bottom. He prefers 1
to 4 if I'm remembering his comments at Sail Oklahoma correctly.
