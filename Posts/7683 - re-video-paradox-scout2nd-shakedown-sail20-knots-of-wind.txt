Subject: Re: Video - Paradox Scout...2nd shakedown sail....20+ knots of wind.

<p>First let me say....I am no-one to be giving advice about micro cruisers or the Paradox. These boats are very new to me so I do not profess that my impressions are correct and they may change as time goes on. :-)</p>

<p>I have been repeatedly asked, "how does she point?" or "what was the tacking angle?"  I can honestly say...as of yet....I don't know. LOL I found it difficult to effectively gauge the wind direction without some sort of windex or wind indicator. This is usually not an issue for me...but being in the cabin shielded from the breeze made it difficult. I will have a wind indicator...if only a piece of vhs tape or something the next time I go out to assist me in pointing.</p>

<p>Stability: I found her to be much much more stable than I ever anticipated. Even at the greatest angle of heel I took her to, she never felt "on the edge". I was thrilled with that.</p>

<p>Tacking: Extremely different than anything I have ever sailed. She does not pivot at the center of the boat like a keel or centerboard boat.....
