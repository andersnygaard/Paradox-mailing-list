Bill, 

I think the Pubs just got out in UK

What difference does it make to anyone if someone wants to build this boat out of wood, steel, ferro-cement, or animal hides?  As a fan of the Paradox design I'm glad to see all its possibilities explored.  I also note that Phil Bolger, Paul Fisher, Jay Benford, and others have offered boats plans where the builder can choose the building material depending on the builder's needs- or whims.
