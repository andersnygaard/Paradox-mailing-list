Rob,

Everything you put in the fire is going to absorb heat, no need for a cast frying pan, a steel cookpot will be enough to melt lead.

I use low pressure LPG to melt aluminum which needs much more heat to melt than lead. The only trick is to make a simple nozzle that sucks air in while the LPG passes the nozzle.

Since you're done with the nasty lead melting.....my reply is somewhat useless LOL ;!!
