Subject: Re: Making a sail

Yes I have.
I have yet to use it however, but the day is getting closer!

I picked a sailmaker who had experience with gaff rigged sails and sent them all the details that Matt posted about building the mark II sail.
I also produced a couple of sketches together with the bend characteristics of the yard (done by measuring the deflection along its length whilst a 10Kg weight was suspended from the centre).

The sail looks great, but how it will work only time will tell. When I look at the work involved, I really couldn't have produced it myself with the equipment or space I have to hand.

It cost me just over =A3400 (UK pounds). I priced up the sailrite kits, but they just didn't seem financially viable for use in the UK.

Next good day I'll rig it up and get some photos.
(you may have to wait a while for the good day!)
