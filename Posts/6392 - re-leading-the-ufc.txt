Subject: Re: ???...... Leading the UFC

By 8:30 AM  local time it shows Whitecaps has moved about 1/2 mile into the lead and Manitou Cruiser is about 6 miles back of Wizard. Both are moving about a knot or more faster, which is to be expected considering their longer waterlines. All are staying inside and will likely be leaving the Atlantic altogether by the end of the day if they keep moving.

Comment from MC: "Gonna push on no matter what the tide says; with Matt and Toby pushing,  you got to stay with the pack."

CrazyRussian is about 125 back of MC and Pelican 40 behind him.
SnoreBringGator is about 80 further back of Pelican and no location or word from RunningMouth.
