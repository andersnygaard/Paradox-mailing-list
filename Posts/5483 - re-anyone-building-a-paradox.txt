Yes... u are right here about the trailer. I saw a vid on the launch of the first swaggie and it looked very awkward to tow and I would not want to take it far on the road. They used a Huge truck and trailer and it looked like it just did the job. It was not graceful.

I would build a swaggie to just stick in the water however, for an ocean version of one giant road trip!

I should think that Swaggie is a bit of a handful to get on and off a trailer whereas, with the right trailer, Paradox is easy.
