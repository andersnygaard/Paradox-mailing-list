Hi Dave,

I feel flattered that you would want to buy a set of drawings for my 'stetched' PARADOX without even seeing a picture. Before I would let a drawing go I would like to know if there are any errors. I do make them and they are always the simple ones. I can't see for looking.

At present I am just finishing design work on a new set of drum fittings. Yes those noisy things, then I will be working on layout drawing for a 53' motor cruiser. A friend has just bought a big GRP hull, but I will try and fit in between my PARAMOUR in there somehow. When I get my scanner working, if Windows XP will let me, I will post a sketch drawn of my last effort on PARAMOUR drawn in TURBOCAD of the sail plan and side view of the accommodation. My latest version is drawn to the scale of 3" - 1' or 1/4 scale which I am using for lofting and the layout.

I will let you know my progress.
