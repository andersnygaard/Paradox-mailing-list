Hi Nels.

Actually, the chine runners don't add to waterline length at any orientation. Waterline is usually lengthened when overhangs at bow and/or stern submerge due to heeling and/or speed. As the Paradox design exhibits little net overhang, the waterline will tend to lengthen negligibly at speed or heel.

I think that your assessment of the effects of the chine runners on the heeled boat being similar to a long keel on a v-bottom, are spot on. 

When anyone asks me about the chine runners, I respond that they are sort of like a Scheel Keel, without the keel.
