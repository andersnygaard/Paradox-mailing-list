Subject: West Coast Trailer Sailers

Thanks for the nice post Matt on how to make the Paradox sail. I can say that from my own limited experience sailing your Paradox recently, that this new sail sets very nicely. By the way, has anyone heard of the West Coast Trailer Sailers? A friend of mind says that they have some nice pictures on their home page of two Paradox' that were present at the Cedar Key get together.
