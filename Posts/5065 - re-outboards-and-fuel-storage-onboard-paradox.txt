Actually my advice would be to keep the lights and the VHF and dump 
the rest. I always take a book with me and my Harmonica. I only read 
the book while I am sailing and I rarely blow on the harmonica. There 
is too much going on in the anchorage, too much wildlife, to bother 
with anything else.

Films and music are escapism, I don't want to escape from my boat.

Hoping for calm nights
