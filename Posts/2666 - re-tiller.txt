The epoxy isnt the problem, the problem is the ash :) good tiller material as it will bend without breaking and return to original shape, and strong. I think what you need to do is steam bend it in a jig, let it sit and dry out, then epoxy it. also mix smaller amounts of epoxy at a time, larger mass will kick fast and burn.

I too was an electrician in the 80's and 90's, heres an even cheaper bender, pack the pipe with sand, it wont kink, you can slip some stronger larger pipe over the ends for leverage to bend it too. old tire rims make great bender heads :)
