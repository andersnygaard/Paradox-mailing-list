Subject: Building Started on Irene May

The ply and Douglas Fir arrived unexpectedly on Friday and despite some very good packaging two of the sheets suffered some damage on one corner, luckily I can work around it. It's amazing how your once adequate garage shrinks in size when one piles up a few sheets of ply! 

I intend to build as per the plans with the exception of adding the window in the cabin roof. Progress will be slow to begin with as I've also a china cabinet to make to keep wifey happy :-)

Going to name the boat 'Irene May' after my late mother who would be thrilled at the idea of having a ship named after her.
