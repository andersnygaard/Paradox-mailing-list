Hey all,

I thought some may be interested in this. I have some Cobra brand GPS units available at a very good price. Stock is limited. If this post is viewed as inappropriate by some I do apologize. I am posting it only because this is a good deal and GPS seems to be staying kind of higher priced for the most part.
