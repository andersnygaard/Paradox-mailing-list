Hi every one,

I just got back from looking at a Paradox in Steinhatchee Fl. It is on a galvanized trailer which was a little taller then I want (would not be easy to launch in shallow water) but the boat is well worth a look for the asking price of $500. If the trailer were more to my liking I would have bought it on the spot.

If interested call Bob Archibald at 352-498-2111 or drop him an e-mail at arch@svile.net. Really nice fellow and has an interesting collection of Bolger Boats.

Tailwinds,

Glen
