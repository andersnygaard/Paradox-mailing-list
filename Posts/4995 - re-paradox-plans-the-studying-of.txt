Subject: Re: Paradox Plans - the studying of.

Hello Pete,

Thanks for the advice, the more I study the plans - the clearer things become. 

I bought Don Eliot's PDF book as soon as I discovered Paradox and it has laid buried in my computers hard drive until you reminded me.

Having now got the plans, Dons work makes sense to me now.
