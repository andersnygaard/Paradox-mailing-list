Today Thu has got herself a bottom.

For preparing to install it, I used an aluminium bar, to check that the chine logs are level to each other and bulkheads. Checked throughout the length and corrected using block plane, and sanded a bit later with sanding block. Illustrative photos also added.

When the bottom was dry fitted, I drilled holes for dowels, through the bottom plywood to bulkhead #3, in order to easily catch the right position when installing permanently.

Next will be to trimm the bottom flush to sides, shape the bow, Chine runners...

Cheers
