Subject: Ballast question

How come the ballast is on the outside and not in the middle.  I would think a torq momentum problem would exist (with a tendency to occilate).  If the ballast was in the center the boat would pivot with the ballast and the bouyancy forces more on the outside (helping to stabilize).  Right now its the opposite.  Maybe the reason is the water tank in the middle and not split into 2 parts.  Or maybe their is a gain of some sort that I don't perceive.  Or maybe it doesn't make any difference.
