A powerful outboard *might* get a Paradox out through surf, if you run up to full speed before you met each wave. It would be scary, though.

Another way which would probably be less scary but again only *might* work would be to set an anchor nice and solid well outside the breakers on your way in, then haul yourself back along the anchor rode. You'd be going slow and in control, at least, but maybe submarining a little bit under the waves. :-D
