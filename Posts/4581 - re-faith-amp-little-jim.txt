Thank you Glen.  Unfortunately, the log petered out because my computer battery could not hold sufficient charge; I guess it is getting old like its owner!

I'll be updating the remainder of the cruise which was truly a great adventure for Al and I.

I learnt a lot from Al how to manage the boat - things like trimming the sail using the yuloh and deploying the anchor.

Bill.
