Subject: Epoxy & Fibreglass

On this business of epoxing or not. I'm getting a little confused. Obviously the bottom needs glassing to offset abrasion. What is the best cloth weight and type to use?

Secondly, I hope to make use of the UK's inland canals and did think of glassing the sides against abrasion, but having seen Al Law's 'Little Jim' it looks to me that the chine runners would protect the sides. Do others agree? 

Finally, is it worth putting a coat of epoxy on the top and sides, without fibreglass, as a 'waterproofing' before painting?

I am using West Systems (easy to get) and am planning one or two extended liveaboard journeys measured in months and many shorter cruises but the boat will usually be trailered.

Thanks for any help.
