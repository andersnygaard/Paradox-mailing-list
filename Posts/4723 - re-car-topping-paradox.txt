Just as a comparison, the 4.6 meter version of Enigma, being built by George Van Sickle, is expected to weigh approximately 260 lbs empty and require a minimum of 110 lbs of removable ballast. The original 3.6 meter Enigma weighs 180 lbs empty. So we are talking an additional 80 lbs for a lot more usable space and payload. I'm hoping to build the Enigma 4.6 some day and plan to use a small utility trailer to tow her around.
