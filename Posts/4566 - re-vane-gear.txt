I can't wait.  What a cleverly thought out system!  I've thought about a simple trimtab system for my little cat, and I also have an Autohelm left over from my last big boat, if I decide I can handle the weight of a battery.  (I probably will, because I love to fish, and I'll want a fishfinder.)

But this strikes me as smallscale elegant engineering at its best.
