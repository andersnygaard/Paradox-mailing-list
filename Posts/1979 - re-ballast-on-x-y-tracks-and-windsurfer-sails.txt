For clarification, what I am currently thinking about in terms of ballast tracks is two box-shaped channels (or four). One (or there could be two of these each way) running fore and aft, and one running starboard / port. There would be pulleys on each side and a box in the center with four skateboard wheels (with bearings) (two wheels on each side of the box, a rope attached to the pulleys on each side between the two wheels). In effect, one would turn some type of ratchet (so the ballast wouldn't wildly rock through the tracks) to quickly adjust the ballast of the boat on the X-Y planes by two adjusters. 

On a side note, one could build in some of these wheels into the tracks of the hatch cover to allow it to move more freely without wax. Skateboard wheels come in a variety of sizes and are a rather cheap solution for many rolling/tracking functions. Many are stainless steel and are self-lubricating in terms of bearings.
