The boom is secured to the flexible gooseneck. This is secured to the deck
by a lanyard that cleats off within the vent trunk.
The furling line also is under considerable tension in normal operations.
The gooseneck is not going to go anywhere in a hurry unless that lanyard
parts company! (it's worth checking for chaff now and again).

I take it you haven't got plans or it would be obvious?

There's a short close up of mine in this video starting at 3m18secs showing
how it's a truly universal joint.
