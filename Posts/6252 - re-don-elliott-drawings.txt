Subject: Re: Don Elliott drawings

Isn't there some possibility of getting all the drawing and designs from Don's widow? She is very patiently delivering Paradox build manuals to all of us. Would she be interested in furnishing some of us with a copy of the majority of his work? With all the obvious effort he put in, I am sure he would like his legacy preserved.
