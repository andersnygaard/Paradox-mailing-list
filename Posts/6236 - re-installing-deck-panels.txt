Ok... heh.. its dumb question time.  Sorry guys (and gals).  I have assumed that the deck panels were nailed to the tops of the deck beams as well as epoxied.  Is this correct?  I have looked over all the photos I can find and I see none with nail heads on the deck where the beams would be located. Nor does it look like any fairing compound was applied to cover them.  I am very much a novice woodworker and have had a problem trying to figure out which size nails to use and where to use them.  It was easier to work out earlier in the build as alot of the placement was obvious. (bulkheads,etc.)  I don't want to screw the deck up, so before I nailed, I thought I ought to make sure.

I nailed mine, just like I nailed everything else. I hammered them down hard to force the heads flush and then, later, glassed over with some light cloth and painted. I didn't fair any of them in and, if you look carefully, it is possible to identify where they are. I consider this a good thing as, if I want to screw something to the boat, I can see where the metal is and avoid it.

Hoping for calm nights
