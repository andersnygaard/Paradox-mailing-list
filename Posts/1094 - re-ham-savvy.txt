Never licensed (close a few times) long-time amateur radio enthusiast here,
also ex Radioman in the USN. I have the tech theory, but not the code or the
money to set up a station.

There's now a (proprietary) Pactor III that supports 9,600 baud (2x Pactor
II and 4x Pactor I), but the TNC/modem cost is over $1,100 (but it doubles
as a we-fax interface), whether used in commercial or amateur service. BTW,
Sailmail requires the use of a certified commercial radio telephone: a ham
rig would not be legal to use in this service.

Errrr.... recent reports are that "to the US" phone rates are $.20 or so
from most places anymore. When I was in the USN at the end of the 60's, it
was $1/min from Australia to the US.

I'm not trying to be argumentative. Ham is a Good Thing! :)
