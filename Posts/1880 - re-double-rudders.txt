Al,

Anything fitted on the transom is going to cause a fouling problem with the main sheet (probably during an unintentional gybe is a crowded anchorage).

A tiller pilot could easily be fitted inside as Glen has done.

It may be possible to fit a powerful wind vane (not needing a trim tab or paddle) forward of the mast. The tiller rope passes round there anyway.

When I have been out in rough weather I have kept an eye on what was going on, but not needed to make much adjustment (the steering line is usually locked off). In calmer weather, returning from the Isle of Wight for instance, I read a book and check the course every couple of pages. And remember, when Matt was winning the Watertribe Challenge he got some sleep while still sailing. In other words, I feel self steering gear would be a bit OTT.

If you do a lot of motoring it may be a different matter.

When the weather warms up a bit we must get together and you can see what you think yourself.

Thanks,
Bill.

P.S. I lost your telephone number. Can you please send it to me via email?
