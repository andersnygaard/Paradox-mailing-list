I can only go with my own experience. My last boat had a forward sloping mast with a balanced lug sail, although it had just 15 - 20% of the sail forward of the mast rather than the usual 30 - 35%.  I can confirm that the sail tended to stay full in very light conditions and I would assist that by sitting on the leeward side of the boat. But a much more interesting outcome was that in strong downwind conditions I never experienced death rolling, the boat just never did that.  I broached her and capsized once under full sail, but that was because I allowed her to get side-on to the waves, not because of rolling. The boom never rode up either when the sail was extended. I suspect that both of these qualities came from the forward sloping mast. There's 1000's of years of cleverness in Chinese boats.

Despite these perceived advantages to the Chinese rig, I'm going to build Matt's Mk 1 sail for Mini. One thing that I'll be interested to experience with the Mk 1, is the way the sail becomes increasingly peaked as it is reefed.  Might also try out a yard vang to the peak when on the wind.  Lots of things to look forward to :-)

Cheers,

Rob.
