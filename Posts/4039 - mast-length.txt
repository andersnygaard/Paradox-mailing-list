Subject: Mast length

In one of Al Law's recent postings, he noted the length of his mast was such that he needed to make a low-profile masthead light in order
for the mast to fit inside the hull. Since I've not yet made or
bought a light for my mast, I'm wondering if others' experiences have been similar to Al's. I'm thinking I've seen pictures of some lights that appear to be about 4 inches/10 cm long.

Though I'm a long way from finishing (I'm sure I'll set a record for the longest build time), I'd rather not find out at, or near the end, that my masthead light is an inch too tall to allow the mast to be stored/transported in the hull.

It's sure nice to learn from other's experiences. Thanks to all the builders who have so ably photographed their building process and even years later are still helping by giving advice to those in the process of building.
