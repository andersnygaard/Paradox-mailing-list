Great David, this is the time to go or at least during weather like we have been having, 80's during the day and cool nights with NO BUGS. 

Nancy and I just got back from a week end in Sabastian, what a beautiful place to sail around with lots of clean spoil islands to walk around on. We didn't sleep aboard though because we had our two small dogs with us and that would have been too much so we pitched a tent ashore but did all our cooking ect aboard. First time I have had two people aboard and I was surprised to find all went well. For those interested in the size I'm 5'9" and 190lbs and Nancy is 5'6" and 185lbs but for God's sake don't ever mention that I said so.

Any way we had two days of great sailing together and an enjoyable evening ashore in a tent. A really great time. David if your up for Apalachicola Bay then let's start planning, I'm free any time so I'll let you pick the date.
