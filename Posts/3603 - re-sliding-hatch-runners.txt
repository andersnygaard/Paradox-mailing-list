Hi,

I'm glad to hear there is a quarter inch thick rail. That is surly the weakest part. I too have wondered about being locked in  by a joker or catching fire from the stove. I'm still waiting for the Bolducs to return home an send me the plans. 

Al Law, I want to especially thank you for the time and effort you put into your website with the building and photos and trip reports. I enjoy them very much.
