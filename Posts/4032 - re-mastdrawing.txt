I believe there is a mistake on the mast drawing. To the left of the 
labelled centreline, and touching it, there are a set of right-
pointing arrow heads. Get some correcting fluid and paint them out.

The Centreline and all to the right of it is a half section viewed 
from the bow.

All the geometry to the left of, but not including, the centreline is 
a section viewed from the port side. (The rear face of the mast is 
straight)

At the bottom of the side view is a half section plan view at deck 
level.

Have a read of the above and look at the plans again and see if it 
now makes sense. It took me a while to work it out.

Hoping for calm nights
