I now have sides, bottom and deck framing / vent trunk done plus
rudder blade and stock and internal panels - I'll post a progress
report and updated photos (Aussie Paradox) in the next few weeks.  

I made my rudder stock much as drawn, but now wish I had not 
made it so high. The main sheet would get caught up in the notch 
between the rudder and the transom, bearing against the top pintle. 
I have made an adjustment to the pintle design which has helped, 
but the best solution would be to have the rudder flush with the top 
pintle so the rope can just slide off aft. I may modify the rudder this 
winter.

I laminated the chine runners to sides before attaching bottom.
 
Did it work out ok?

Hoping for calm nights
