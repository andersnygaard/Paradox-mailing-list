Subject: Re: Next Question - rudder lock-down??

I don't know whether anyone has tried it on Paradox, but here is the system Chris Morejohn and I came up with for his 32-foot sharpie Hogfish. 

Weighing down the rudder blade doesn't work, for a couple of reasons. For one, the force is in the wrong direction. To get a balanced helm the rudder blade has to pivot slightly forward, and you can't do that with gravity. 

For another, when the boat is charlie-horsing in chop, the weighted rudder blade builds up angular momentum on the upswing, causing it to jump up. This makes for an absolutely unmanageable helm.

The pivoting rudder blade has a groove cut into the upper part of it, and a Dyneema line sits in that groove and goes around a pulley in the back of it and up. Pulling on this line causes the blade to go down. 

This line is then spliced to what's called a fool's purchase on the upper part of the rudder, which two stationary blocks with a thin (1/4" or 3/16") nylon line that loops through them. The end of that line goes to a jam cleat.

The effect is a springy tensioner: you put just enough force on it to drive the blade all the way down, but if you hit bottom all that happens is that the nylon line stretches a bit.

If anyone is interested, I can provide some photos of Hogfish's arrangement. Hogfish used to have the same arrangement as Paradox, and I found it to be deficient and fixed it with Chris's help. Now it's perfect.
