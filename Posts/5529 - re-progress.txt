Thank you Steve.

You've some interesting modifications.  I particularly would like some feedback on how the tack strop arrangement performs in practice.

I too would like to see how this performs. I would suggest that it is bolted down, not screwed. I suspect that it will see some 'interesting' loads. The big advantage of Matt's bit of string is that it is a genuinely universal joint.

Another feature is your ballast which appears to be lead sheeting laid internally on the bottom of the boat.  When sailing to windward, Paradox sails on her leeward chine, which combined with the chine runner becomes a very effective keel, but then the genius of Matt's arrangement for lead ballast comes into play, because the windward ballast has leverage power.

I have found that being able to move the ballast about, to get the correct trim, is a valuable feature.

It looks as though 'Ironsides' does not have the lower side bins for storage which will give extra room inside, but I find mine on 'Faith' really useful.  I use them for stowing heavy items like bottles of squash, lemonade, emergency flares, Reed's Nautical Almanac etc.

I agree, the rear bins are particularly useful as they are within easy reach of the helm. Mine are full of all the things I may want while sailing (binoculars, snacks, rubbish bin, snacks, sun cream, snacks etc.)

Hoping for calm nights
