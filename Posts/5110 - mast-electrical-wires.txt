I'm asking for some help. I'm making my mast now and I bought the wire I want to use. The lower connection for the anchor light has me stumped. Is the connection best made above deck or below? And how waterproof does it need to be? All my previous boats had no wiring. You guys who have done this already, is there anything you could tell me?

Best,
