The chine runners don't really have a lot of drag associated with them. During our two and a half months together, we never noticed any appreciable speed difference downwind between Little Cruiser and Paradox. However, in shallow water (less than 18 inches), Paradox had a definite advantage to windward over Little Cruiser since we couldn't lower our centerboard deep enough to be effective.  

As for building Paradox as a first boat, I wouldn't recommend it unless you have done a fair amount of woodworking already. I think you should hone your skills on a sailing dinghy or a row boat first. Though the Paradox hull is not necessarily complex, the complete boat is very detailed, and it will require a substantial amount of your time to complete.
