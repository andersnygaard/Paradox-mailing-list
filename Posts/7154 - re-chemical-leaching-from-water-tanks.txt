Subject: Re: Chemical Leaching From Water Tanks

Long term, leaching isn't a problem. The major concern is the short term residuals from the epoxy setting process. When I worked in a boatyard, the standard remedy was to steam clean the tanks we made. I have no idea if that actually eliminated all contaminants, but it did get rid of the ones you could taste.

Does anyone knopw what the leaching characteristics are for dried epoxy.  Wouldn't want any toxic breakdown products in my fresh water supply!
