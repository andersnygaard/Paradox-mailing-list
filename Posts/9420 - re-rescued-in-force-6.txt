I'm not sure why some of you feel the ballast tanks as designed are rot hazards. The interior of the tanks are lined with epoxy saturated cloth and you can get your arm in (only just I admit) and wipe up the last of the water, about 0.5 cup per tank, following the pump out.

Where I worry about rot is the bulkhead just aft of the ballast tanks (bulkhead 3?) where water could sit while the boat is trailered and I can't see it as it's sitting under or behind the lead ballast pigs. The bulwarks are also an issue as rainwater can sit behind them if the boat isn't trailered at the correct angle.

Of course, if I was lucky enough to be able to store my boat inside, all of these problems would evaporate!

Cheers,
