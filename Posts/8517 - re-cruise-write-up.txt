This slipway is in a boatyard that charge for it's use.

The reason Jim was launching onto the slipway, rather than into the water, is because the water had gone away. The bottom of the slipway led to acres of mud, nearly half a mile to navigable water. No-one else would be using the slipway, certainly no powerboater, until the water returned, by which time Jim would be disappearing over the horizon.

One of the reasons I often use this technique is that I can have the slipway completely to myself so there is no rush. Just drop the boat off the trailer, park car and trailer, get on board and make a coffee, read a book and wait for the water.
