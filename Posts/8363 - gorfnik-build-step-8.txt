To install the cabin uprights, I drilled and then sawed and filed out the space for them so it was a tight fit. Then I glued them to the sides (which were not painted in those spots) and screwed them in also (I had put backing plywood in those spots as previously mentioned).

At the back, I added a three inch wide plank (slanted at the front) to support the back-rest/cubby plywood. Note that the back-rest support butts up against the seat support (so the seat can be flipped up into the notch at the end of the seat support without falling off the back). At the top, the back-rest support is cut at the right angle so that it can be glued directly to the rear cabin support.

There is also a 10 X 32 inch piece of plywood into which a semi-circle is cut to make a divider for the rear cubicle. This leaves a 7 foot long sleeping space which is plenty. The semi circle is cut 4 inches from the bottom and starts at 7 inches from each side.

The divider is glued to the back of the rear cabin framing. It is installed 1/2 inch off the bottom so it is easy to sweep the floor of the cubicle into the main part for pick up with the dustpan. I'm guessing here, but in case of capsize I figured I would also want to let water flow back into the main space for bailing and sponging.

Two new pictures in the Gorfnik album.
