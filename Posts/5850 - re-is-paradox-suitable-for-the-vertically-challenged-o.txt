You can just add three inches to the cabin dimensions (vertical ones 
that is) and you'll be fine. You may also enjoy the idea of making 
the lower edge of the dorway to the "Forward Stateroom" flush with 
the cabin sole. Others have done this with agreeable results. My wife 
comented on our first sailing that the boat seems so small on the 
outside but very roomy on the inside! Good luck with whatever you 
decide.
