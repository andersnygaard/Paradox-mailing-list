Subject: An unexpected benefit of the sprit rig - self steering
Date: 02 Dec 2018 07:25:07 +0000

Hi all,

I've just posted a video to YouTube. You can find it here: https://youtu.be/4mGI9sDHU9g. My main reason for the change was to stop water dripping onto my stove from the wet sheet, but after I started making the changes, I realised there's a number of other benefits, perhaps of most interest to this group being self steering.

I haven't done anything about it yet, but I'm thinking about adding trim tab self steering with a vertical wind vane... make the thing as simple as I possibly can!

I was sailing in heavy chop at one stage in 20+ knots and she charged to windward on both tacks while scandalised, so now that I've put that reefing question to bed, I'm happy to say that the sprit rig does deliver on all the things that matter... to me anyway. Amazing how different she behaves depending on wind speed. Light air testing of reefing and then attempting to extrapolate the results doesn't work. You have to carry out your testing in the real thing.

Cheers,
Rob.
