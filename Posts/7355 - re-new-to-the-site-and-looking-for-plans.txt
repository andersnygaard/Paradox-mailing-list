If you look in the files section and count downward to the fifth item you will see the info you need to buy plans.

Hello Chuck,

Thank you for reaching out and expressing your interest in the Paradox. We're glad to have you here! As per Nels's suggestion, the plans are available for purchase in the files section. If you count down to the fifth item, all the information about buying the plans will be there.

If you have any further questions or concerns, don't hesitate to reach out.

Best,
Stephen
