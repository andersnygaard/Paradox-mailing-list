Hello Stuart,

Pardon the tardiness of my response, but I spent a large part of my free time over the months before Christmas reading every message of this group from its inception and frankly had taken time off from it! So much information to digest...

I live just north and west of Lansing, about an 1-1/2 hours west on I96 from you. I've admired the Paradox design for a number of years now; acquired the plans and build manual myself many months ago and have spent countless hours since studying the plans and listing questions that I have of them. My intention is to begin my build no later than a year from now, accepting favorable answers to some of those questions and the scheduled completion of my build site. Ah, details, details...

I agree with your assertions on sharing the experience. I think I would enjoy giving any assistance I can and certainly could use your insights and perspective. Feel free to email me.

Regards,
Kevin Kroll
