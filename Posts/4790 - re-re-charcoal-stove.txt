I have to admit that I have, on occasion, stuffed a towel into the ventilator on my Paradox to reduce the cooling effect. As Paradox was designed for the climate in Florida there is, perhaps, an excess of fresh air for cooler climes. I already have 2" of foam, and don't feel the need for more.

Any one used to dinghy, or small yacht, sailing may not appreciate how much warmer it can be just to get out of the wind. With 'normal' sailing clothes I have found myself uncomfortably warm in weather which went below freezing at night.

I have never felt the need for a heater.


Hoping for calm nights
