Subject: Re: buy Paradox plans

Hello,

I do not sell the plans for Paradox, Dave Bolduc does, he is at the Yahoo Mirocruising group.

I do however sell a building instruction guide for Paradox.

About the Building Paradox articles:

I have all the Paradox series of articles ready for immediate shipping. There are some fifty pages and 16 articles. The articles cover a detailed description of Paradox along with detailed building instructions. It is in booklet form and is fully illustrated.

The price of the Paradox series is $8.00 plus $2.00 shipping in the states. If you live in Canada or overseas the cost is $8.00 plus $4.00 shipping (USD).

Send your order to Don Elliott, 711 Wisconsin Ave, Box 202, Tomah, Wisconsin, 54660. You articles will be sent the same day I receive the order.

Overseas order payments can be safely made with cash, this is done by putting the payment (USA dollars) wrapped in heavy paper and placed in an envelope, this saves the expense of a international money order, I have received payments of this kind from many countries around the world.

Thanks for the interest in the articles.

Great boat, none anywhere like it.

Don
