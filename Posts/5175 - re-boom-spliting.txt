I have already shaped the end of the boom to a spherical radius for just the reasons mentioned. I'm surprised that so many of you took Matt's meaning to use a machinery bolt. I had assumed he meant a lag bolt. I wonder how you call these in Briton. A bolt with big woodscrew threads, and a hex head. On another note that trip to the Schilly Isles is impressive. It would seem scary to me. It must have been exciting. The honda got a lot of use. Yuloh-ing that far would be discouraging I suppose. Before you trip there I had never heard of the Schilly Isles. I was also surprised that there is an actual place called Penzance. I thought it only existed in a musical. Dopy me.

Cheer, Steve Yahn
