Hello,

I am currently looking to sell my paradox boat as my wife has decided she prefers sailing. I have recently acquired another boat and as a result, my paradox has to go. The boat comes with a trailer that has new wiring, submersible lights, new bearings and tires. 

The boat is located in Canada and has been tarped up to prevent snow damage. If anyone is interested, please let me know. Pictures of Al's Paradox are attached.

Thank you.
