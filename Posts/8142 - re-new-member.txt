Hello Terry.

That is an interesting story about Small Fry getting demasted. I have no knowledge of this so if someone could chime up I'd be interested in hearing more too. I did read about Small Fry and a Benford Badger meeting up in a remote area down south, and I'm pretty sure it's the same boat. We should ask Geoff Davis to do an IAmA (I Am A ) on reddit so we could ask him questions about his boat.

Mt Jeoff Davis, are you out there?

Hi,

I've not long discovered the Paradox, and held the plans for just over a week. So I'm a newby as they say. So far I have the bulkheads and transom done and just started on the deck beams, slow work at one a day :) but I am so enjoying the build and fascinated by the design. I look forward to going through the old digests to learn some tips.

Today I learned a bit about a Paradox called SMALL FRY from Western Australia that any members may know of. Apparently in 2009 a Paradox was rolled and dismantled off Fremantle in near hurricane force winds. If the news article covering the rescue, a. mr Geoff Davis raved about the design, and how it kept him from being washed overboard etc. I the discovered a reference to Geoff Davis some five years later sailing SF 400 miles up the coast and still loving the design, adding that he'd sailed her around Cape Leeuwin.

Does anyone know this guy or boat, or more of the story?

Thanks,
Terry
