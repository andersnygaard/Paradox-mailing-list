I am the head moderator and will look into archiving what we can. The biggest drawback to Facebook, which I am a member but rarely use for security reasons, is the inability to go back and research past discussions. Not sure where to put the archive if we can save it..... any suggestions appreciated.

cheers
Glen

Do any of you have the full email archive (or even a large portion of it)?
There are about 9,500 messages going back to 2001.

When I first joined, I was keeping a copy, but then I rationalized my email collection a bit a figured I could always look these up on Yahoo. Hmmm... I guess not any more.

I'd like to archive the contents of this group now if I can, but spidering/mirroring Yahoo is going to be tricky. If anyone has an archive of the emails they can share with me I'd be very appreciative.

I don't know who the group moderator is now. Does the moderator have access to create an archive of the conversations?

Thanks,
Matt

PS. I don't do Facebook, so thank you all for your contributions here over the years. If I do eventually build and launch a Paradox I promise I'll sign up to Facebook temporarily so I can let you know. :-)
