the plans call for 12 mm ply for the sides (about 1/2 inch) which weighs 50 lbs per 4x8 sheet. to this add the weight of resin, 6 oz. cloth, filleting material and over the years the accumulation of water vapor. the decks can be built in a guage of aluminum slightly less than 1/8 inch. all in all the aluminum boat will be lighter in the areas where less weight is desirable and its weight will not vary.
construction of the chine runners is also greatly simplified as sheets exceeding 4 ft in width can be supplied.
part of the reason in listing the advantages of aluminum is to convince myself that this is indeed a reasonable option. the boats i have built in the past have been wood-carvel, cold mold, strip planked. but the Paradox is unique, innovative and inspired. somehow aluminum fits the overall concept at least as well as the called for plywood.

To compare materials:
A 1/4" thick 4'x8' sheet of fir plywood weighs about 25 lbs.
A 1/8" thick 4'x8' sheet of aluminum weighs about 55lbs.
