If building to the design specs, douglas fir would be the strongest.
You could also use Sitka spruce, Honduras mohogany, and Alaskan yellow cedar, but with some associated loss of strength. Depending on your location, there may be more choices available with similar characteristics. 

The Sitka spruce and douglas fir should exhibit similar grain, long, tight, minimal run out. The Honduras mohogany should be chosen from planed stock if at all possible, as it tends to have a wilder grain.
The Alaskan yellow cedar should just be straight and clear. I don't think that Sitka spruce could possibly be outmatched for enjoyable workability, but the cedar smells sooooo good!

If you were to utilize the birdmouth method, and with a carbon fiber sleave, you could use any of the woods mentioned, while still retaining a great deal of strength. I'm looking forward to seeing Glen's ideas regarding the tapering of the individual staves for the birdmouth method.
