Subject: Re: Best shape for Chine Runners?

Interesting points Nathan,

It is too bad there are not more versions to compare performance of
different shapes in chine runners but doubt that will happen anytime
soon. Some people have tried variations but never seem to report back so
maybe did not work all that well - who knows? Don't forget they are only
one facet of the overall design that includes the hull and rudder design
as well as the displacement.
Making then wider and shorter can lead to more damage if hitting
something. If the hull is shorter than Paradox with more curvature in
the hull then shorter and wider might be a bit of improvement. Longer
and narrower on on a longer hull with more potential inertia if hitting
an object might be the way to go?

Since they are not retractable like a leeboard or centerboard, they have
more wetted surface to add resistance when motoring, sculling or sailing
off the wind when other foils would be raised.
Everything is a compromise.  I think  I read that Dave Bolduc found that
Little Cruiser would not perform  as well in shallows when he had to
raise the centerboard but pointed higher than Paradox when in deeper
water.

Chris Morejohn's 38' modified sharpie Hogfish Maximus had both chine
runners and centerboard and a big rudder.

The one incalculable is Matt's ability to sail almost any tiny boat
better than most mortals. I would tend to follow his designs as drawn as
best I could though.
