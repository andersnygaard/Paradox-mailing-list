Subject: Re: Batteries as ballast?

Well....that is true in THEORY.......but lets say I go on a day/weekend sail 15 times a year....which would probably be an upper limit for most busy  people in nice climates or people with alot of free time that live in areas with  not so cooperative climates......a heavy rowing workout 15 times a year just  aint enough to keep the rowing muscles in good shape when you need  them.....besides, I have never gotten the impression that ANY sailboat is  particularly well suited to any form of rowing/human propulsion.....
 
Anybody here got any WAGs as to what a reasonable human body can put out hp  wise continous?
 
I seem to remember something along the lines of 1/6 a hp, but I cant  remember if that is the arms or the legs or total output....but I think that  number was for the legs typically....
 
Also, I gave a 100 pound weight for a 100 amp hour 12 volt deep discharge  lead acid battery and I think the real number is closer to 50 lbs than it is to  a 100....
 
take care
