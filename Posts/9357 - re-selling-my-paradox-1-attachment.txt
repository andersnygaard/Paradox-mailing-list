I'm very interested, problem is timing, we have just started to finish up some major works and renovations on the house. Could you please send me some more photos of your Paradox. I know what you mean about finished price, I am finishing up my OZ Gooseamd that has cost nearly 4K.

Hi to all , especially today all in Australia .
I am thinking of selling my Paradox for a larger boatMy partner wants to come along too , so we now want a bigger boat
It has served me well , just back from another four day trip along the Gulf here in perfect weather .
I built the boat over 8 months with a little help from a shipwrightI have built two boats prior to this one and had some experienceThe more difficult jobs were completed at Duck Flat Wooden Boats , a professional and respected builder here in South AustraliaIt was made from the finest woods availableFirst Grade Marine PlyOregonHoop pine and KapurCompletely fibreglassed out side and some of the interior is glass clothes as well
It’s made to plan , except for the mast , I paid 1250 dollars for a round hollow , “birds mouth mast” of first quality hoop pine , it’s light and a strong as can be made . I wanted to see the process and I wanted it light and extra strong , it’s also a bit of a work of art to look at .
It comes on a registered trailerWith a 2.3 Honda motorProfessionally made sail , the mk2 version in good conditionA 70 litre underfloor PVC water tankHas some signs of wear but in near perfect condition , ready to goThe cost minus labour was over 8000 Australian dollars
All the bugs are ironed outIt sails just as it should and is a lot of fun and for me very adventurous
Wondering what interest I would get here before I advertise it on boat selling web pages
Hope someone is out sailing one right now
