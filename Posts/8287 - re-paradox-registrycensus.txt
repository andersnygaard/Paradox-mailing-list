Hello,

Well the group Paradox registry has been set-up. It will require some clean-up and is not complete yet. Please check it out, and add needed changes. I guessed at a lot of the dates, and the owner's and builder's may not all be the same. This first phase was to identify Paradoxes with photo albums. It's a starting place.

Regards,
Sea Gypsy
