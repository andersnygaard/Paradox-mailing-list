Subject: Re: Time and dollar total to build a Paradox?

I had general do-it-yourself experience, shelves and such like, and was a general bodger, but this was my first real boat.

If you follow the suggested build plan you would have to work quite hard to get it wrong. Apart from turning the boat over and some moving of the larger sheets of ply I did the whole thing single-handed.
