But Derek. Why are you leaving. Your new boat is classed as a microcruiser in my mind.

And in mine but this is the Paradoxbuilders group Jeff?

So?
I, along with the majoroty of the members do not have a PARADOX, and there are 753 members of this group, and how many of us own or are building one?
You have just down graded your membership, that's all. But in your mind, is the idea of building another (great name for your new boat).
Problem solved.
Welcome back from the brink.
