times.

Hay Bert !

I just turned 60 !=A0 I own a 26 foot modified sharpie of Glen-L design and I love being able to beach it which I have done many times!

The only reason I am looking at building is because I want to sail the Atlantic alone before I get too old to chance it.=A0 

I love the Paradox too, but I need to carry stores and spares for 3 people a cat and a dog LOL =A0 I got really intrigued when someone posted about making a 28 foot Paradox, but the more I look into it the more I doubt its feasibility.=A0 In the files section there is a file about larger paradox which they stretch to 16.5 feet.

If I could feel safe about crossing with my sharpie I would!=A0 It is not self righting past about 35 degrees and not self rescuing either like the paradox is.=A0 I know the folks at www.microcruising. com and they have had great luck with Matt Laydens boats.

Just so you know, I have thoroughly researched Bolgers designs too like the long micro and Martha Jane and his new AS-29 (but I like Jessie cooper best!)=A0 see http://www.boatdesign.com/tomboy/ Cooper/Page. html=A0 as it was the ancestor of the later AS-29 designs.

I would still like to sail the Atlantic and coast of Africa with a large Paradox, but i am beginning to doubt it is possible to make one that large and retain all the sailing characteristics.=A0 It would end up turning into another boat anyway.

Kindest Regards,

Andrew

Wow, thanks for all the consideration. ... seems like other tall folks have worked on the sitting height question.=A0 I have looked at other designs as Swaggie.=A0 That's a great design BUT I'm really intrigued with the shallow draft and simple design of paradox.=A0 It may seem lazy of me, but at my age (65), patience and skill level,=A0Paradox seems much more doable and exciting the way she goes to windward without a centerboard, etc.=A0
I've owned a west wight potter, shallow draft, flotation, lots of good qualities, .... but probably not as strong and =A0sea worthy as a paradox.=A0

I had to laugh at myself:=A0 i checked back and it seems I raised this same issue of head room a couple of years ago on this site....embarassing to say the least ;0)

I'm in Michigan, my daughter is in Minneapolis and I think I heard a paradox was on the west side of Wisconsin or near Minneapolis. ...obviously it would be best if I could visit one.... have auto, will travel if there is one available for viewing...=A0 Most of all thanks for your thoughts, REALLY appreciate them.

Bert
