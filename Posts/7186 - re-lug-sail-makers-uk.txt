Don't go to Quay Sails in Poole.

I remember Jeff Please writing that there was a place on the IoW that knew about lug sails, but I can't find the post. Apparently they should ask you how much the yard flexes so that they can take that into account. Quay Sails didn't ask me and I had to fiddle about with my sail to correct that error (if you look on my early pictures you will see a nearly vertical crease in the upper part of the sail that was the result).

When tacking in light winds at Seafair Pete, with his Mk2 sail, seemed to be gaining on me so that may be the one to go for.
