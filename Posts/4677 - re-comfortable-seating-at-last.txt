Subject: Re: Comfortable seating at last

Thanks, I had known for some time that there should be a simple solution and had been playing with ideas for a couple of years. My final solution came almost by luck when my cushion got caught between the seat and bulkhead. 

It's these little details that Matt has included in such abundance that make this boat so good.

Hoping for calm nights
