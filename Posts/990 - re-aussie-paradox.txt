Hello, welcome to the club.

I'm not sure I understand this, but make sure that you can easily 
remove the bins once the deck is on. It makes it so much easier to 
clean out after a trip.

Vent trunk sides will attach directly to edge of ply on frame 2 hence 
the extra opening on port side and routed slots to deck level.

I have made provision for water tanks but they are not a certainty 
yet.

The water tanks are the one thing I would change if I was building 
again. If you are sailing in wilderness conditions they are probably 
a good idea, but where I am sailing it is only necessary to carry 
water for a couple of days. I may still cut the tanks open and fit 
solid ballast.

I dont expect to give another progress report for some months as I am 
accumulating construction funds for now.   I'm sure most Paradox 
builders are familiar with this predicament.  I think a good boat for 
about $5000 Aus is achievable.

Been there, done that, found it well worth the effort.

Hoping for calm nights
