Subject: Rescued in Force 6

Hello,

I have uploaded a file with a story about my rescue. I hope this adds something to the understanding of what a Paradox can do. While there have been lot of discussion regarding the limits of design, I have not seen it defined very clearly. The Paradox certainly looks after its skipper. A lot is then up to the endurance and mental state of said skipper. How many hours can one put up with conditions that are rough and dangerous in terms of potential roll over.
