Hi Jeff,

Are you aware of Don Elliot's "Building Paradox" articles? I am a first-time builder. If it wasn't for the articles, I would have never attempted building Paradox. I'm reluctant to give advice, but I cut the bevels after everything was glued and nailed. Everything was cut oversize to accommodate the cutting of the bevels, including the floor members. Do consult with Glen or Don!
