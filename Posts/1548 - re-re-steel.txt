Subject: Re: Re steel

I am entering this discussion late, however ---- in his 
book "Buehlers Backyard Boatbuilding' George Beuhler gives mention 
to a boat that was built of steel to the waterline and timber above 
the waterline. 

On another tack (and if protection against collision is the concern) 
why should a layer of steel, or maybe even stainless steel, not be 
incorporated in the usual plywood/epoxy layup ?????

Great discussion, 

Alan
