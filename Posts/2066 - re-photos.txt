Hi David.

I was just able to enter the photo section, but we have a warning message up which says that we're over our storage limit. It might be a good time for all who have photos stored in the photo section to cull through their own album for content and size. I've eliminated my large format photos in the Swash album as a preliminary step, but that was several weeks ago.

I'll see if I can start up a paradoxbuilders2 for the purpose of additional storage and let Glen sort through the details upon his return.

I look forward to viewing your new photos of Whisper.
