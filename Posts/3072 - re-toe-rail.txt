The toe rail, as designed, is cheap and effective. The shape also cuts down on windage and does not collect dirt.

A toe rail made of extruded aluminium is more than likely to be at right angle to its base so when fitted will lean out, not to mention that it would be higher than the rail as drawn. The aluminium version is also fitted using screws which could be a channel for water getting into the hull structure even when using mastic.

Apart from being in my opinion ugly, the only advantage I can see for fitting an aluminium toe rail is if it had holes to attach fenders, but then there are hand rails on the coach roof for that. Don't even think of fitting bogg standard aluminium angle. Yuk...gross, cheap looking!

I would save my money and buy a decent compass with it instead. Fit the toe rail as Matt designed.

One other observation. Paradox is just the right height when dried out on a beach to sit on the deck with your feet on the sand. An aluminium toe rail would'nt half cut into your arse.

WHAT?????
