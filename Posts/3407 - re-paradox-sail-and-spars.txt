That's as it should work, but why do the plans show one side of the 
boom curved and the other straight.  I've made my boom as per plan, 
but it may have been better not to have a curved side.

I'm assuming the problem will remain with my curved boom, when the 
sail is fully set, and whether the sail is reefed or not, the yard 
will still bend under its weight and the weight of the sail.  The 
bending could increase because of the force applied to the the end 
of the boom by the sheet when the boat is on the wind.

Well, I don't know much about how the sail should be set (and I am 
sure mine could be improved), but I would have thought it was much 
easier to play with the yard (putting initial curvature into it etc) 
than to have the sail modified. If it doesn't work you can just go 
back to the standard yard, but if you have had the sail recut it 
would be difficult to put it back.
