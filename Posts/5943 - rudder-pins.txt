Subject: Rudder pins

I'm sorry to hear about your rudderstock Al. This reminded me of the rudder pins in my own rudderstock. This may be of some use to new builders. 

I wish I had taken a photo of this. I have made a very rough sketch of the shape of the pins and plywood halves. The 1/2 inch stainless steel pins were bent with a oxy-acetylene torch. There is a hole in the upper pin for a large cotter pin to keep the rudderstock from falling out of place. Thickened epoxy was used in the grooves cut into each plywood half and the whole assembly wet out with epoxy in the normal way for the lamination. 

I have put my rough sketch in the photo file "Ironsides", it's at the very last. It seems too dim unless you click on it to see it bigger. I have not had much time in the boat so far, so it's not prooven to be a good idea. It's also a tiny bit cheaper than what is in the plans.
