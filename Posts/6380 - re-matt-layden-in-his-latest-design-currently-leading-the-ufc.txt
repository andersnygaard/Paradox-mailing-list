He is going to have some great wind today and tomorrow although too much for my taste.  When the wind is coming over the trees it is flukey blowing 30 one minute and nothing the next.  I am sure that he is debating going outside....as we speak.  I would stay inside in such a small boat.  He likes to sail just off the beach, I have noticed.  Of course, I wonder why?  I wish I had his knowledge.
