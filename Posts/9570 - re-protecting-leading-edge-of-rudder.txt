I’ve tried different things like rope, thick fiberglass and even split copper pipe. The best I have found by far is to epoxy thick webbing around the edge. When the webbing strap is completely wetted in epoxy, I fold it lengthwise around the edge and hold it in place with masking tape all over, which is then sanded off once dry. 

Yep, great depth finder.

Cheers.
