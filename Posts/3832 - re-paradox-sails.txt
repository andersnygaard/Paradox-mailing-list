Subject: Re: Paradox sails

I was wondering about the roller furling and the sometimes problem of sails winding onto the Drum. Don't most comercial rollerfurling drums have stationary housings or shrouds around them. I imagine that a housing would keep the line from falling off and keep the sail over on the boom. Wouldn't it? My own boat is far from this stage so I'm just conjecturing at this point.
