Subject: Mast Construction Help

I have received my plans and will be starting my scale balsa model soon, however I can not figure out how the mast is constructed.

I understand it has four sides, but the profiles don't seem to make sense to me. The center profile drawing would seem to be the rear section since it's flat on one side so the other two should be the two sides and the front. But how does it fit together?

Thanks for your help.
