I want to change the construction of frame 3, and eliminate the bins between bulkheads 2,3 and 4 (the sleeping space). I intend (at this early point) to narrow the verticle webs of plywood at the sides down to 1 1/2 inch wide. This will be stiffened with steel angle 1 1/2 by 1/4 inch. The top and bottom areas of bulkhead 3 will be per plan. I intend to epoxy coat the steel with a good thickness for rustproofing. The reason for all this is I need to make room for sleeping two. 

I have thought also of maybe making "cloth bins" which could be unhooked and stowed elswhere as needed. So, I mention all this because some of you who have finished your boats will have a beyter insight than I. Anyone else should feel free to comment too of coarse.
