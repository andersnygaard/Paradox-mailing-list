That's not sissy: that's sensible!

Best wishes,

Hi Roselt

Good luck with your Paradox build and I bet that you're looking forward to getting her finished and in the water. 

Thanks for the info re Small Fry. I'm looking forward to Geoff giving us a report first hand as it would help us all to gain more knowledge about the limits to the Paradox's seaworthiness.

Interesting that you compare the Paradox to the old Vertue as they're very dissimilar in design apart from the disparity in size. 

I bought my Paradox from the original builder - Bill Serjeant, 7 years ago - and it's certainly turned out to be one of my better decisions. I've had loads of cruising in her and enjoyed it all. I'm convinced that it's the best boat for me. But I'm too sissy to go out in storm conditions to find out the limits for myself.

Best
Jim

Hi Paradoxers,
I am very slowly building the Paradox Planktos in Perth Western Australia. I contacted Geoff Davis quite a few years ago through this group. Geoff has told me about the capsize. I will leave it to him to tell the story. What I know is that he did recover the boat and fixed a hole in the side of the hull and made a new mast. Since then he has done many long trips including to Abrolhos Islands and back to Perth (2013) and then to Shark Bay (2014). Both of these were very substantial journeys along a pretty wild coast. The boat has performed well. Geoff has sailed with me on my Vertue (Yacabba) which I have since sold. Geoff has only good things to say about the Paradox design. In short, it has most of the attributes of a Vertue but on a smaller scale. 
Regards
Roselt
