Subject: Cabin Top forward beam.

I've been busy putting together the cabin superstructure. Now the thing that has me puzzled is the f'wd beam. The bottom of the window is curved, and yet the upper beam is shown as straight. This leads to a quite pronounced rolling bevel on the corner posts. I'm thinking that it would be easier to put some curvature into the upper f'wd beam. I don't have any lexan yet so don't know how flexible it will be to bend to this curve, but at present it doesn't seem quite right. I've cut a piece of cardboard but it's not stiff enough to properly follow the compound curve.

Am I barking up the wrong tree?
