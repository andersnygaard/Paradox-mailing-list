Hi Nels. You are quite right. Thank you for the reminder.

I tend to shy away from 4-strokes, but only because of the experience I have had with one 10hp Honda. However, I think that a 4-stroke really is the way to go if indeed someone opted to use one on the Paradox design. 4-strokes like a little work, and the heavy displacement of the design would certainly provide it. Fuel economy is much better with the 4-strokes than with the 2-strokes, but they also are more complicated. I would opt for the Yamaha over a Honda, for the simple reason that Yamaha has a better network for parts and labor, throughout the world. This of course assumes that such availability is necessary.

I must defer the question of weight and practicality to David, aboard Whisper, and Dave &amp; Mindy. I simply don't have the experience with engines on Matt Layden's designs to speculate. I'll try to utilize the yuloh aboard Swash, but I'm open to a small outboard if I find the need for one. I think that a lightweight side mount could be fashioned from a tube/pipe in deck chocks, or mounted through the side of the hull. Either mount would be removable with little indication that it ever existed, thereby preserving a clean appearance. I think that of greater concern than the engine weight would be the weight of a needlessly oversized outboard mount.
