Subject: Enuf's Calamity Update

As of 2000 hours today the rudder blade and stock definitely seem to be hardening off.
Not so sure about the hull but that has been in the workshop all day.
I've aplied neat hardener, sparingly, to a small patch and will check that out tomorrow.
Forecast tomorrow is good, mind you so was this evening's and it's raining now, so I'll likely run the hull out into the sunshine.
