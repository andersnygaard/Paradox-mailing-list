With plans and build manual in hand, I started to lay out the bulkheads today.  I know it is quite an undertaking, but I'm ready for the task.
 
I am a novice builder, and I welcome any and all advice from those of you that have built a Paradox.  As I make progress, I will post messages and upload pictures.
 
Wish me luck!

Congratulations on a sensible decision. Where are you based?

Two quick tips: 

Make all the spars, rudder etc first. If you have limited space the hull won't be getting in the way and when you finish the hull you can set sail immediately without having lots of fiddly bits to do.

Make the vent box and fit it to bulkhead 2 before assembling the hull. This allows you to fit the mast to the mast step with the mast horizontal. The alternative requires the mast to be continually lifted to the vertical and over the deck for test fitting.

Good luck.
