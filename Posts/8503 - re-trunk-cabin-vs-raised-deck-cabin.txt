On the topic of seeing out the windows, how tall (or short) can one be and still sit comfortably inside a Paradox? Do I understand correctly that Matt is somewhat slight? Is there a problem such that if you are too tall you have to scrunch down to see out. Or if too short you can't see over the deck? Of course if too short a thicker seat cushion might solve the problem. I'm 6'1" (185.4cm). John

I am 5'6" and have no problem sitting inside wearing a hat. Because the boat will probably be heeled (when sailing) it is necessary to duck down to look to leeward and sit up to look to windward.

When sailing I am never sitting bolt upright but am lounging back so the sitting headroom is greater than might, at first, be expected.
