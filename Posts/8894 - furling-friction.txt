Raising sail is no problem. Halyard pulls as smooth as silk. The yard goes right up. The sail unfurls with no problem.

But, when trying to pull the furling line - it is incredibly difficult, and I can tell the furling line is wearing out quickly. Something is not right.

Any tips (other than adding a topping lift) from the experienced Paradox sailors.

Respectfully,
Bobby
