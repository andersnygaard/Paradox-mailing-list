Subject: Don Elliot's book?

Is it still possible to get a copy of Don's Paradox build manual? I've been trying to talk myself out of launching into a big project right now but I can't stop thinking about Paradox. I've owned the plans for years and the eventuality of it keeps looming larger and larger in my skull. I find elements of the plans a bit enigmatic (no pun intended) and wondered if there is good information to glean from Don's book and maybe even a good plan of attack. If I can keep from getting too obsessed and break the project into a series of small tasks over a year or two I'm sure I can squeeze it out of my crazy schedule.
