Hi Al,

This is the kind of stuff I need so I when I start sailing classes in the fall I don't look like too much of a landlubber. So.... How does IN THE CAN tell me about bouy shape? I picked up the Starboard,green, right stuff cause I grew up in the Star Trek era. LOL 

What started this post was, well,= my mind saw P&amp;S as standing for everything but Port and Starboard. Position&amp;Sand... etc. heheheheheh

Hoping for dreams of sailing on calm nights,

Rod
