hi Nels

Did you see my post about Owen on Microcruisers? If not, mail me and I'll forward his mum's email to you.

Yep, it's a Porta Potti. I've just bought a new, more compact one (the 335) more suited for the solo bum. Still no room to use it without pulling it out of the forward stateroom unless, I guess, you've just had a bad curry.
