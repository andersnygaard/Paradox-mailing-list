Tristan Jones is above all a grand storyteller.  I think it is best to enjoy the story without subjecting him to a lie detector.  After all, there are usually a few lies in most of our stories. Most critics consider him to be a great adventurer and an artful master of tall tales. How much is true...well he took that information to the grave with him, no dought.
