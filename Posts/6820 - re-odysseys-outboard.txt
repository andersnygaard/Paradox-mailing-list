Alexander,

I loved the video of the boat. Is that teak on the deck?  The deck looks amazing.

I used Tohatsu 4 hp as an outboard. Perhaps, it's a bit heavy (57 lbs), but that was what I had. It was a short shaft model and it worked out fine, I had to use it in choppy seas once and the prop was always in the water.
I like this model for its internal tank (1.3 L), which is enough to push the boat for over 1.5 h at ~5.5 knt (calm conditions). 3 gal external tank, I admit, was excessive, as I hardly used one gallon for the whole trip. In the future, I will have one or two ~1L sealed metal cans with fuel.

Good luck with your boat,
AF

Alexander,
Congratulations.
Sounds like you had a great time. The boat looks great. Thanks for posting the photos and videos.
What size engine is that on the back? It looks like a fairly large one with it's external tank.
I'm hoping to launch this coming weekend.
