Dave,
No need to tell me about the Cornish range of boats Dave. I am a mine of useless information when it comes to boats. I was there on the first day at the London Boat Show when the Crabber 24, made of plywood, was having its first public launch.
I will be going down to my den (it's better described as a pit), where I will have a rummage around for that article. I don't think it would be prudent to post the articles in this site due to copyright etc, but there are always photocopies and the mail. Sorry chaps. I might add there are articles in other magazines on the Gollant Gaffer as well. 
Its a pity you weren't in love with a 1985 Chinese junk rigged Corribee, fin keel. I've got one for sale (this is for any Brits who are reading this and looking for a boat). Its just over a foot longer than the GG. Offshore version with the small round portlights. Going Very Cheap! -End of advert-
I will give you a shout when I find the article(s).
