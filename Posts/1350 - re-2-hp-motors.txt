Hi Bill.

I can't speak for the ability of a Paradox to plane under power, but your question immediately reminded me of the first time that I ever saw something akin to chine runners.

The Bartender line of powerboats, from the board of George Caulkins, do have what are perhaps best termed "planing rails". They help the double ended boats to get onto, and stay up on plane. They are positioned well aft.
