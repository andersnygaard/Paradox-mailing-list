Subject: The end is nigh...again!

There's been several scares recently about Yahoo Groups shutting down. This time it looks like it could be for real.  If we want to keep discussing Paradox's (I'm keen...I love my Paradox) it seems the best place to go might be Facebook. There's already a Facebook page here https://www.facebook.com/groups/227800127272325/. We might have to migrate to that unless someone else has a better idea.
