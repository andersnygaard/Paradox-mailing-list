Subject: Sheet layout

A couple of weeks ago I got the articles and plans. Thanks Don! Thanks Dave! I have studied it carefully and I find it all very fine and instructive. But when I started to lay out the cutting lines on the first sheet of ply I met a prolem. What are the C-formed pieces in the middle of the 9 mm sheet with BHD 1?  I cannot find anything like them in the plans? Can anyone explain? I=B4d be grateful.
