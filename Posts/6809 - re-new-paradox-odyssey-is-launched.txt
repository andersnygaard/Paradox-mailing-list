Hi Michael,

Let's do the Tip of the Mitt adventure :) I signed up with BlackSun on his new for him Norse boat. Want to join us? I can bring my inflatable. :) How's ChefRamen doing?

Yes, I should apologize for that foreign language we were using in the videos :)
Alexander is more and more impressed with his new boat, He put quite a few miles since he left Staten Island. He navigated tricky inlet from Ocean to Great South Bay with tide running against wind, surfing all the way in between breakers. He is very impressed with how the boat handled it. I hope he will tell his story after he gets enough adventure. He is very happy.
