Hello,

It could be argued that Paradox is bigger than Little Cruiser. Though Little Cruiser is a foot longer it has a centre-board case taking up lots of the room inside.

While I totally agree with Alexander do not let that influence you. Lots of people have said they are going to build a bigger Paradox but, as far as I know, none have done it yet. If you do build it I will be very interested to see if you end up with a capable cruiser, like the original Paradox, or a disaster.

My money would be on it being too heavy to be a good beach cruiser while still being much more cramped than a conventional cruising yacht.

Let us know how it turns out.
