Hi,

Hope you are on the water now and the winds are fair.

Sadly, not yet, because I've departed from the plans :-0 !!! 

The problem is, I'm 5'10" and unless I've somehow screwed up my measurements, I couldn't work out how to sit comfortably on the seat with the hatch open without having to hunch forward. Either the rear cabin posts had to be moved backwards another 150mm or so, or some other hatch arrangement had to be made. Since, I had already attached the posts and the 3 layers of 9mm deck laminates before I concluded there was a problem, I've opted for a different hatch arrangement. It's nearly mocked up now and I'll post pictures when it is done. Most of my inspiration has come from Sven Yrvind's hatches with strings http://www.yrvind.com/present_project/?m=201507.

Cheers,
Rob.
