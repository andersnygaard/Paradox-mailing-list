Are you making the boat wider too? Or are you just going to have the 
sail sticking out over the gunwale when stowed? Is the mast going to 
be taller too?

Actually you could make the cabin higher by increasing the curvature 
of the cabin top or raising it only at the rear. It is only the 
corner between the side and the top, near the front, that is a foul 
point for the furled sail when stowing

Hoping for calm nights
