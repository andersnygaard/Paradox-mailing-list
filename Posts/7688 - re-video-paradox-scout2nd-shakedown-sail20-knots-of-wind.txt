Alastair,

I wish my sticking out of the Paradox was because the seat was mounted other than to plans! LOL It's not. I am a big guy at 6'4" and 230lbs. My friends say I look like I am on a carnival kiddie ride when sailing Scout! hahaha

Glad to see you are getting out there and enjoying your boat.

Did you intentionally mount the seat higher than the plans say? (Or 
are you particularly tall?) On my Paradox the boom passes well clear 
of my head and the sail does not obstruct my view. When heeled over 
and 'lounging' my shoulder fits just under the top cabin member and 
only my head is in the wind.
