Hello Folks,

I found a lumber company that can supply lumber; they are 4.5 hours away in another state.

Nonetheless, they only sell KD DF lumber. Does it matter if the DF is Kiln dried, or does it need to be air dried only? Not sure if this was a topic of seriousness before on this portal; they also mentioned the quality of the wood is good (clear vertical) and they do not count grain per inch for density measurements in evaluating the DF.

Does grain count matter much too? Anyone concerned about such details?

Again, can folks share their thoughts about KD versus non KD?

Thank you,
Deric
