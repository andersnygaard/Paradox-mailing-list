Subject: Tack Strop Question...
Date: Tue, 26 Feb 2013 03:56:35 -0000

Ok so I am working on the tack strop system....and I am not totally clear here ....I see the line inside the bottom tube....and the line goes into the vent box to a cleat?  So...is the end of the bottom tube just floating on the line and pushing against the deck? Seems like it would gouge....I see some other incarnations in the photos....but looking for a photo of the way described in the plans......  If I go that way....is the line itself working as the "universal joint" at deck level??  Any help appreciated...  pictures of a "stock setup" would be even better!

Or is there a better way everyone is doing?

Thanks 
Sean
