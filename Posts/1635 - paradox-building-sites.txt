Subject: Paradox Building Sites

Just want to inform everyone that if you check out the links section here - there are several other websites that discuss Paradox.

Also there are probably 100 other discussion groups on building boats in various materials.

I suggest that a person will have by far the highest chance of success when buying plans for the building method and the type of boat you prefer, rather than modifying existing plans.

Also you will get far more assistance from the designer if you run into problems.

Don't ask me how I found that out:-)

Cheers, Nels
