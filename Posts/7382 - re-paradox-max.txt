Hi Gunther,

I would also like to see how it works.  I have certainly considered the bigger option.  One idea I had was to keep the frames the same but just stretch the sides longer.  Either way I think that experimenting is what it is all about.  Matt Layden arrived at the Paradox design after quite a few different boats.  So why should someone not continue the journey.

Good luck
