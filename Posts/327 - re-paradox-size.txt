I had thought about the same thing.  I am a mere 6'3" and 210 lbs.

I have decided to go with 10%.  More than 10% becomes problematic in 
that you will need an additional scarf on the side panels.   The 
bottom of the boat will also exceed 4' without the chines  -- more 
scars and probably more waste.

Other than those caveats it should be pretty straight forward.
