Hi Pete,

The sailmaker I have used for years now is Graham Caws. His details are:

Company Name: Caws Sails 
Address: Unit 16 Somerton Ind. Park Newport Road 
City: Cowes 
County: Isle of Wight 
Postcode: PO31 8PB 
Country: United Kingdom 
Phone: 01983 299397 
Fax: 01983 299397 
Contact Name: G Caws 

I have used him for about 30 years now and his work is always tip-top. He specializes in race sails, in particular windsurfers, Moths and Cherubs as well as catering for the cruising set. He likes the odd challenge. And they don't come odder than me. I certainly give them to him. The thing I like about Graham is he listens and was not offended when I gave him Matt's instructions on this latest thoughts of his Mk2 PARADOX sail.

Sorry for the delay in responding (work got in the way!)Thanks for the info. I'll give Graham a call and get a quotation. When will your sail be ready? What high build epoxy primer are you using? questions questions......

Cheers,
Pete
