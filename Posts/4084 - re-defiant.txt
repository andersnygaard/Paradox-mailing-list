Strewth Al.
Now you tell me.
To late.
DOWH !
Just an update.
The weather over the last few months has been........?..........Pants.
The wall has not been finished and so the roof of my work area has still a gaping hole in it, but one of the builders has started moving some bricks around near it.
Its to cold and damp outside now so I will have to wait till warmer weather to continue building.
I so wanted to get the hull glassed all over before winter. But it ain't to be.
Once the deck is glassed I can then fit the cabin top.
I might try and fit the chine runners if we have a couple of days fine weather.
Still the rudder and stock are cut out and the material for mast, spars and chine runners will be here next week.
Have you put LITTLE JIM away for the year now or will you be doing a bit of frostbiting?

I cleaned out the inside, and threw a cover over it at the beginning of October, but that doesn't mean it can't be taken off again. A bigger obstacle is that I have taken on a 6 month contract back at my old firm so am tied up, except for the weekends, 'till April. I had the cover off a few weeks ago for a day sail in a reservoir, and am expecting to have another in the near future but have nothing longer planned.

Hoping for calm nights
