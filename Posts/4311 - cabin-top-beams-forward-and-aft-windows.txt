Subject: Cabin top beams, forward and aft windows

I fitted the forward beam and the aft beam and the central beam to the cabin top today. Is it really necessary to fit another beam between the forward beam and the central beam? When I made the beams nearly two years ago, I was under the impression there were only 3 cabin top beams upon which the plywood was laid, but now I note there is one between the forward and central one. I suppose it has to be there to provide strength, sufficient to withstand the weight of a person sat there, perhaps when in harbour. The fibreglassing will strengthen the structure, but would it be enough to dispense with the missing beam?

Did anyone find difficulty in bending the polycarbonate around the forward and aft sections of the cabin trunk? I note the upper forward beam is shown in the plan with a straight edge and yet the lower part of the window has to bend around a significant curve. The same applies to the aft window, although there is not such a great differnence.

I'd welcome you opinions.

Bill.
