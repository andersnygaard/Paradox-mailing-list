Subject: Re: Mast Questions

Bill,

Where should the flex exit the mast?  If the exit is above deck level, where does it go from there so that it can be attached to the battery terminals?  As the mast is mounted and demounted for trailer sailing, there needs to be a plug and socket of sorts for the flex to be separated, but where is the best place for the plug and socket?

Thanks,
William


At the top I brought the flex out just below the wooden plug. At the bottom I fitted a socket as low as I could so that I could reach it from inside.

Presumably you reach the plug by access through the hole in the deck that feeds the vent box with fresh air.  How far up from the bottom of the mast did you inset the socket and I suppose it was on the port side of the mast?

Sorry for the delay, I've been away.

You could do that. I brought mine out on the aft of the mast and reach it from inside the boat (a bit of a contortionist trick actually)

I put it as low as I could and still have clearance for the plug to go in. It is a water resistant plug/socket so water splashing in shouldn't bother it. The socket fixes on from outside so I left some spare wire inside the mast to make the connection easy (and if I damage the wire at the top I can pull some more through without having to replace it all.)

I like that idea, which is possible in your case, because the wire passes loosely through sections of pipe lagging which are glued to the mast's interior.  Although the wire moves when the boat rolls, there is no noise from it.

I was going to attach my wire with special fittings, but unless I leave surplus wire at the top and bottom, I shall not have any spare if there should be a need for repair.  I'll just have to make up my mind what will be best.

Hoping for calm nights
