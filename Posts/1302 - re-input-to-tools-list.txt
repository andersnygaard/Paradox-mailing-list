Here are some places that will ship them anywhere:

http://www.nolansupply.com/ 
www.leevalley.com
or, if you must spend more-
http://www.garrettwade.com/  nice description, though

A German version that looks similar (Pattern makers rasp_halfround --not Nicholson) is at http://www.fine-tools.com/feile1.htm 
It may be more available in the UK. I have no experience with this brand, but it may do just as well- I personally would try a tool like this before spending this kind of money. Maybe your local fine tool store has one and will let you try it in the store. A good tool is a tactile thing.

While checking out these sources, I came across other Nicholson rasp fans-- http://www.rutuonline.com/html/tool_box.html he says Garret wade has the German type, but I didn't check. also--
http://www.rogervm.homestead.com/Saw_handle.html
and--

Nels was right, they do cost more than what I paid 25 years ago. But it seems like that was more money back then. You will look for a project to use these tools on.

Incidentally, I found in my search that Jack Nicholson has a laugh like a rasp. HAH!
