Here is the picture of the solar panel support again. Sorry for the wrong link: http://www.microcruising.com/Graphics/st20057r.jpg

Below is a picture of L.C.'s hatch when it was almost completely sanded down. http://www.microcruising.com/Graphics/st20036r.jpg

Next is another shot of "Swamp Thing" with me looking down into the cabin. The aft deck is nearly repaired. Unfortunately, there was a nasty core void that ran right across the bottom. The veneer on top of the void was rotten so everything was pretty easy to dig out. You can see on the left where the hole in the bottom was patched by someone else, and on the right is where I sanded a "v" on each side of the core void. After this picture was taken I ground down the plywood patch nearly level. I still have some more grinding to do, but eventually I will fill everything in with epoxy, milled glass and fiberglass. Then the cabin sole will get a layer of 10 oz glass to reinforce the bottom some more.
