I envy your patience and courage, well done.

I have an outboard and I carry a liter of fuel for each day out. It's way too much and I use fuel stove bottles to carry it. The plastic jerry cans are stinky and cumbersome. I rarely use it, but it's there. I'm a novice and as patient as I hope to be, I resort to using the outboard for convenience. It has gotten me out of trouble once. Trusting the wind forecast which is normally deadly accurate round here, I got caught out. I laid in one big tack to take advantage of the predicted wind, it never came. I'm a long way out and facing a night arrival in an unfamiliar shallow entry port. Two hours of the outboard grinding away saved me a very uncomfortable night, on the other hand, the adventure of anchoring on a sandbar I was abeam, miles off the shore, might be a better story?

Well done for being simple and brave.

The mainsheet does get caught in the motor. I have the mainsheet repositioned to try and prevent it from fouling.
