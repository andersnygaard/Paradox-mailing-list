Hi Steve,

If I was going to junk rig a Paradox I would look at Erik Mees YouTube channel. He has built a Paradox 20% bigger and used a junk rig. Alternatively look at the micro cruising site by Dave and Mindy Baldoc. Their Little Cruiser rig should be of interest

Cheers,
Tony Woollcombe

Hello all,

I have the plans, I have the build book, i have the workshop, and I have a ton of questions. I have never built a boat before, never done fiberglass before but with time and patience I hope to do both.

Questions:

- Is a paradox too small to be out on a big body of water? (Lake Ontario)
- Am I wrong for wanting to junk rig this boat?
- Are there any paradox sailboats or owners in Ontario?

Thanks,
Steve Bowman
