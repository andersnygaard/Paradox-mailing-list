Subject: Re: Considering Dingos and Modifying Paradox

Who is allowed to change the design and have it still be a Potter? As I understand it, the rig of a modern Potter is somewhat different than the rig of a Potter as first conceived and built. They started out plywood boats and are now built of glass. There have been a number of other changes. Is it only the original designer who is allowed to change a boat and still call it by its original name? Only the holder of the trademark? This seems a primarily legalistic view.

Don Elliott argues that a Paradox is such because it is a complete sailing system. This is somewhat esoteric since any sailboat must be a sailing system of sorts. It is all a matter of degree.

Well, you're clearly a charitable person. My interpretation of Don's view is that he suffers from a sad character disorder that causes him to reject the views of others if they differ in any detail from his own.

But maybe I'm being harsh.
