Greetings Matt,

Thank You for the info. Yeah, I will probably have to break down and buy some "Gold" Plated Plywood. Darn! I really like your Tip on Painting the Hull different colors for each coat. I will be "Trailor Sailing" I won't be living in it or anything {Yet anyway...{:>} 

Thanks Again,

Dave Blow
PS-I put a few more Pics in Paradox 3
