Hi Phil 

There is no problem at all when turning into wind, the weather  cocking tendency is quite strong. It's turning away from the head to wind position that's more difficult.
Often the boat will lose steerage way before being established on the next tack and stick head to wind.

If I'm lucky - with the ideal wind strength and smooth water and I get up enough speed before turning,  the boat will tack successfully - just as Dave B described. .

The dynamics of the Paradox are very different to the normal sloop and take some getting used to. I've been sailing mine for 6 years and still learning.. 

Best
Jim
