Would aluminium or stainless steel sheet be possible alternatives?
I have spent =A3600 so far. The sail will cost me =A3400 and I am reluctant to spend another 
=A3400 on epoxy that I must then paint to protect from UV damage. Alternative, economical, 
bottoms are a priority.

I am wondering about the feasibility of doing the same thing as is done to the bottom of the McKenzie River drift boats if deliberate grounding is planned. They put a sheet of uhmw plastic or nylon on the bottom. I am not exactly sure what it is called but it is a kind of industrial grade material that is also used as bearings, rollers, and anti chafe gear in industry. The drift boat guys swear by it.
The navy uses it to pad the flight deck in the areas where the tail hook strikes the deck to eliminate damaging the hook or the steel in the deck. It can really take a beating.
