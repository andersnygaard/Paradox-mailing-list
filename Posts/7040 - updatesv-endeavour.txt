Subject: Update...s/v ENDEAVOUR

Good Morning To All,

To all my faithful Paradoxians I again apologize for lack of keeping you all informed, but alas I do have new pics as the "roll-over" is complete, as well as the starboard chine log and the port chine has been started. I must admit however that ENDEAVOUR'S chine as well as the now completed sheer clamp was accomplished by laminating two (2) thinner runners in place to ease the installation involving the twisted contortions along the PARADOX hull lines.

I am hoping that in the long run, she will appreciate the "extra" glue joints along her sheer and chine. And once these pieces are glassed into place I have no worries as to her strength.

This week it is hoped we can finish the chines and begin covering the bottom with ply and follow with glass....

More coming soon....

Greg
