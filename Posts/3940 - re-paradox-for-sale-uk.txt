Hey Niels.
You could always buy it and keep it over here and commute weekends ;-).
Hi Derek. Sorry to hear about your diabetic condition. After all that work, there is nothing to show for it but a great little boat built by your hands that will give pleasure to someone else.
Have you had a word with your doctor, like Niels said, about bumping up your levels for when you want to go sailing?
I was looking foreword to meeting both Al, yourself and a brace of PARADOXI out on the water some time.
You still have the plans, why not make a radio controlled model of ENUF?
