Subject: Re: Ground plate attachment

The ground plate is flush with the bottom Dave, and yes you are correct in assuming I faired it in after installing it. I'm not sure if I mentioned it in the files section but the ground plate was made from one side of a piece of 6" copper flashing which is generally easy to come by at your local roofer's supply.

The vacuum bag was sealed with mastic which can be found at Lowe's or Home depot in the window section. It is the same stuff West sells as Vacuum bag sealer but at a fraction of the cost. It comes in 25 ft rolls and is about 1/8 inch thick and 1/2 inch wide, light gray in color. Chris Morejohn put me on to this stuff back in 92 as a caulk for everything aboard and after all these years I have never had a leak after sealing ports, thru hulls anything.

It is really great to use when you are putting in a single screw because all you have to do is pinch off a little put it around the screw and install, no opening tubes of 5200 only to have them go hard after their open. By the way I never use 5200 anyway because I am the one who will have to remove the part at some time for repair.
