David,
I used two Douglas fir 2x4s.  First I "thinned" the 2x4s on the radial arm saw.  Then I narrowed the handle end using a saber saw. saw.  Next I laminated the two pieces together using the simple technique Alistair mentioned..elevate the ends and put weight (or clamps) on the middle to get the 30mm deflection.  I've not done the shaping yet, but think it will go fairly quickly using a portable grinder with a sanding disc.
