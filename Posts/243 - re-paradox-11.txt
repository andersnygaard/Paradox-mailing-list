Just think through the implications of fitting bilge keels to PARADOX. She would be slower through extra drag from the keels.

Because the the chine runners are so long they are curved to the hull.
See second sketch
http://home.triad.rr.com/lcruise/Sketch1.htm
If chine runners could be made without the curve, they would have less drag.
If chine runners could be build with a better angle when heeled than Paradox's. With the ideal being straight up and down when heeled. 
They could be smaller and have less drag.

The mounting of the keels would require extra internal structure.

Paradox is by far the strongest 14' sharpie I've seen.

The leeway shown is nothing, which proves that the chine runners really work.

I think Matt just tried longer chine runners to improve performance. 
(Why change perfection?)
