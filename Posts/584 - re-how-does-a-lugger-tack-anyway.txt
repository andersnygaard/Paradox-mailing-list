Subject: Re: How does a lugger tack anyway?

Hi Neil,

The rig is designed to stay on the one side of the mast permanently. As far as tacking goes, I think I have that figured out. Whisper will tack without the outboard, (68 lbs). Now I need to figure how to do it with the outboard. (I like the motor I have and don't want to change. May have to!) It all boils down to trim as David B. was saying in his post. Any Ideas? I have played with the ballast and cannot find the right combination (with outboard). If I cannot find the right combination, I will have a new 4 hp 4 stroke Yamaha long shaft for sale , If anybody is interested.
