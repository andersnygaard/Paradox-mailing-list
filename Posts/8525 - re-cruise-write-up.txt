Hello Rob
Sorry but I can't advise you about the chine logs. I didn't build my boat personally and bought her 'ready made' from Bill Sergeant who,  incidentally,  made an excellent job of building her.
But It can't do any harm to laminate any parts that have a challenging curve,  if that makes the build easier. 

  
Best
Jim
