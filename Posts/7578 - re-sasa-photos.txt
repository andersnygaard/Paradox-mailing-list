Subject: Re: SaSa photos

Hi,

I'm here really under false colours as I didn't build my Paradox myself but bought it second-hand. At this moment I'm sat in her at anchor near Plymouth.

Free surface effect.
If you fill the tanks completely there isn't any because there is no free surface.

Drinking water
I wouldn't want to drink the water in the tanks and have a separate supply for that. I fill the ballast tanks with the stuff that I'm floating in using an electric pump. That's the easiest way that I've found of doing it.

Outside Tiller.
It would get tangled in the sail's sheet each time I tacked and spoil the space on the aft deck which is so useful for putting stuff on while at anchor. It makes a kind of extension to the storage space for overnight.

Sent from my inside tiller.

Best,

Jim

Yes, a double tillered Paradox.
I don't think that has been suggested in my reading of earlier posts. The above deck tiller should allow the bungy cord or surgical rubber to tiller/sheet to boom self-steering system (Captain Voss raw chic). I will upload some photos showing how I tortured my beloved SaSa's behind into shape. While I'm rabbiting on I want to suggest to the Paradox builder/owners how about water bladders in the water holds. The holds don't have baffles, 70lbs of water/ballast lolling back and forth, this way and that and making splooshing sounds when you're trying to get to sleep? The water might be better contained in a number of bladders (include their own taps) down there in the holds..

Re-reading your message gave me the answer: You'll have two tillers.

I'm looking at your build (and others) before deciding whether to build a Paradox myself.


You're putting the tiller above the after deck instead of through the transom. So you won't need the hole in the transom. I see your transom has no holes, neither for the tiller nor for the spars.
So why have you installed the bendy-scoopy-water-drainy thing inside the transom?

I'm impressed that you have built a curved transom: could you give us more details on how you did that?

Oops, problem uploading pics, going to Johanna file. Sorry about that.
There is a photo of the 'upper tiller', above deck to enable self-steering. There will also the beneath deck tiller as well for interior steering.
