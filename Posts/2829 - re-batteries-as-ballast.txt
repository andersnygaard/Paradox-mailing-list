Subject: Re: Batteries as ballast?

Hi all..

sorry if this question is a bit too generic for this forum...

I have a real interest in small, simple, "squareish" daysailers/micro cruisers....

And I have noted 2 things....

First, many of them often have a fair bit of lead ballast to increase stability and sailing performance.

Second, many sailors seem to have an almost loathing hatred of outboard motors, though personally I don't find them to be that obnoxious....

So, this brings up a question.....are any of these smaller designs "compatible" with using batteries for some/all of the ballast and thereby allowing the use of an electric trolling motor rather than an old 2/4 stroke?

Better yet, anybody know of any micro designs where such an arrangement has been designed in?

You could fax PCB and Friends and get their opinion as they are really into what you suggest. The BirdwatcherII uses batteries for ballest and stability and it is designed to carry enough solar panels to keep them charged up except for extended usage.

Birdwatcher may seem a lot bigger than Oldshoe but in fact is easier to trailer and launch and you need that deck surface to get enough solar panel exposure. It is also designed to row and can be used with a yuloh or the option of 25 lb 2hp Honda 4 stroke stored in a waterproof nacelle.

Then in addition to OLDSHOE, there is SUPERMOUSE:-)

Cheers, Nels
