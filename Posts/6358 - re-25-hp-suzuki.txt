Hi Steve

First, I hope the thief's balls turn square and fester at the edges.

Second the motor.  I have had one for 2 years now and have had no problems with it.  It's the lightest 4-stroke 2.5hp outboard that I know of, with a dry weight of about 26lbs, which makes it very easy to transport.  It is significantly lighter than the equivalent Tohatsu.  Suzuki have gone to a lot of trouble to keep the weight down.  The plastic lid is the thinnest I've ever seen and even the transom securing screws are made of the smallest amount of metal possible.

There is no reverse gear; the motor is rotated 180 degrees instead.  A full (1 litre) fuel tank seems to last forever.

I don't think you'd be disappointed with the Suzuki, but having said that, Honda have a supreme reputation for reliability - at a price.  You get what you pay for I suppose.
