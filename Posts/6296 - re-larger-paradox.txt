According to my GPS she might transcend hull speed just a bit.

Probably too chicken!  The plans have me impressed enough with the complexity of this build that I'm afraid of making it worse!  Maybe with Ironsides-style bracing, lowering the opening of the "stateroom" and maybe also bulkhead 4, and adopting Johanna's aft cabin washboard, I'll find the original size roomy enough for this oversized skipper.  Anyway, this is down the road when my boys don't want to crew with me anymore.

ps--a couple of questions for the experienced set: how shallow can your Paradox sail?  What are typical angles of heel?  How fast is she in light airs (say 5kt) and good breezes (say 15kt)?  At what wind speed does she hit her hull speed?
