Thanks for the concern.
The heater instructions mention CO build up so I always test before using the workshop. 
I say to the wife,"just check the thermometer in the workshop." She has come back in 
every time so far.

For what it's worth, I've cut a hole in the transom for the spars to go in. It is about 150mm 
diameter and has a ply circle with a 180mm inner diameter glued around it. It is closed by 
a 180mm circle of Lexan that has a bolt through the center and a bar across the inside 
with a captive nut in. The whole is sealed with a cork gasket. Hopefully, this Spring will see 
if it works but it would have been quicker to fit a proprietary dinghy unit. On the other 
hand, I was feeling creative on the day I made it :0)
