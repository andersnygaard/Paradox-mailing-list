Who, me or David?

You'd be very unlikely to wear one out, and as you say it should last a long time. I've had 
them break or nipples come off on motorcycles and they are essentially the same 
construction on the Honda. If it did break you could operate the throttle with string attached 
to the piano wire part of the control but it would be easier to replace the cable.
It is, however, only a thought.
