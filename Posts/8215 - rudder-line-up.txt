Subject: Rudder line up

I have spent a lot of time worrying about how I was going to do the rudder.  For those others who are worrying about this step, I have posted some photographs of what I am doing.  Once I got started it was not that hard.  I bought a stainless steel rod long enough to reach from the top fitting to the bottom.  I measured up the off the shelf top fitting and made up a dummy set up out of two wooden off cuts.  Then I drilled a hole through these along the line where the fitting will finally go.  I then passed the steel rod through this hole and lined up with the bottom bracket.  I discovered that the rudder blade needs to be cut back just as shown on the plan to avoid it bumping against the hull as the rudder swings to the starboard side.  I drilling the bottom bracket by lining up the back of the drill through the dummy hole in the temporary top fitting.  Hope this helps somebody out there.
