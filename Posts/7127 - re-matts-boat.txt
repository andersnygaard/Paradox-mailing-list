hi Nels, there were two different conversations going on here......One was about the issues of balance with chine rails. It appears Matt had to significantly rake the masts of both Enigma's though with the Paradox he seems to have got it right the first time. Someone mentioned that there did not appear to be major mods on Ellusion......This year Matt clearly decided to use Sand Flee

6th photo is of Matt at the start. Looks like Sand Flea to me? First time I ever saw him smiling!
