Subject: Stitch and glue Paradox?
To: paradoxbuilders@yahoogroups.com

Hi,

Does anyone know if I built the Paradox stitch and glue style, will it change its sailing characteristics and does the sail need to be modified? Will it still be self-righting?

It would be a lot lighter, so would I need more ballast?

I was thinking of buying the plans and using the dimensions to create whole bulkheads out of single sheets of ply instead of constructing them out of lumber and just using the hull plates with stitch and glue fillets.

Or is this too simple-minded, and a whole different kind of boat would be the end result?

Any info on what I'm missing would be great. Don't know much about boat design, so not sure what measurements need to be adjusted and whatnot.

Thanks.
