Depends on what you need, Rob.

A car battery is designed to give a high current for a short period to provide the cranking power that starting a car requires. While a deep cycle battery is designed to give you a steady current flow . The method of construction is different in each case. One has lots of thin plates while the other has fewer but thicker plates.

A car battery will be damaged if you discharge it more than 50 per cent of its capacity and its life will be short if you make a habit of running it low.. A deep cycle one will last you longer then. Although any battery will suvive for longer if kept fully charges for most of the time

If you have an 80 a/h battery, you can realistically use less than 40 a/h, due to ineffeciencies, anyway.

Best
