Subject: Re: Sheer clamps and bulkhead #1.

Bulkead 1 is a safety feature, because if the boat were to get an 
appreciable amount of water in her, it would not flow over the raised 
base, but there could come a point when it would, especially in a 
wild seaway.  Going the whole hog for safety, it would be better to 
have a watertight hatch fitted or to make the whole of that forward 
section closed.

I've not put any buoyancy into my boat; the way I see it, is that she is exceptionally strong, and if built in all other respects as per plan, she should keep the water out.  There's always the chance that she could be knocked down when the hatch is open, but I believe she would very quickly right herself.

My preference is to keep the bulkhead as shown on the plan, although I have seen others like Al, who have cut into it.  He does have internal buoyancy in the form of foam insulation.

Stepping and fitting the mast is dependent on the integrity of the vent box, but by opening up the port side of bulkhead 1, it is weakened.  Incidentally, I place an additional support for the mast on the starboard side of the top of the vent box =96 just a piece of wood glued to it going fore and aft.  I believe Al did the same.
