Do you know what sort of loads it will have to withstand?

 Hi All,
    With Paradox There is a problem with the main sheet fouling on the
 rudder and rear cleats, This problem is compounded with an outboard .
 I am thinking about adding an arch (sch 40 Brass) to clear all
 obsicals on the rear deck. Any opinions ?
