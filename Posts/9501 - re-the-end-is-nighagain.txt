Greetings, Matt. 

Glen and I co-own Paradoxbuilders2. I've given you ownership access as well.

However, I'm only a moderator of Paradoxbuilders. Glen is the sole owner and only he has the ability to grant ownership access for the purpose of migrating to groups.io. You may wish to communicate directly with him.

Thanks for your efforts to keep these resources available to everyone. I still own Swashfrog with the earnest desire to complete her and sail ambitious voyages, but I'm also in the middle of a refit of my Freedom 40', Eyrie of Astoria, which I'm converting from cat/ketch to cambered-panel junk cat/schooner. I'm stretched a bit thin.

Thanks for your efforts.
