Hi Nick,

Glad all those alterations are working out for you. On one of my Paradoxes, I tried, successfully, to use only one continuous long line which goes from the furler into the cabin and back out to the top of the mast and down to the yard. Since when one line goes out the other line goes in, this means I no longer have anything other than a short loop in the boat at all times. Will change my second Paradox to the same system as soon as the line wears out.

I hope your topping lift doesn't get you into trouble. As I previously stated, my opinion (and Matt Layden's too) is that it is not a good idea. I prefer a half topping lift, only at the front end, it works just fine and I like knowing it can't tangle the yard.

Best wishes and thanks for sharing your adventures.
