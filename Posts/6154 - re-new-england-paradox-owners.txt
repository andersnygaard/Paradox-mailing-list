Well either I have read it wrong or you have. None of my nails went 
into the ply end grain they all went into the cleats (That's the only 
reason for them to exist as far as I can see).

Whoops, no you are right, bulkhead 3 (18mm) does not have any cleats 
on the sides. I think I used 2 nails either side as location pins 
into pre-drilled holes.

That said, it is so strongly constructed that stitch and glue should 
make a perfectly good boat. In fact I did consider assembling mine 
without the chine logs or sheer clamp, just putting an epoxy fillet 
in after assembling bottom and deck. Fortunately common sense 
prevailed.

Hoping for calm nights
