Subject: Spar storage

For you guys who have finished your boats. How does the idea of storing the spars inside the hull workout? It would seem to me that the U shaped rod in the tack of the boom would be too large to fit thru the transom hole. Do you just leave the sail bundle on deck?
Also I have never seen any mention of a sailcover to prevent sun damage when in storage on deck. Is it needed?
