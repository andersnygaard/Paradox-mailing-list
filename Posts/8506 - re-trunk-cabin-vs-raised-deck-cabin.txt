Hi John,

Pushing the side decks out to the sheer line. Humm. I've seen it. When I sailed my Paradox in Texas with Mike Beebe, his Paradox was built with side decks out to the sheer line. Mike liked to sit sideways holding the tiller, so he had modified his Paradox so the tiller was longer and he could use it like on a standard sailboat. He did miss the side decks for storing the Yuloh and mast. It was also much more difficult for him to get on and off his boat by climbing up top. I think he was planning to revert the cabin to the original design, and instead of going to all the trouble, decided to sell the boat and build himself another.

His second Paradox has a cabin built as per plan. I guess that's a good indication that the widening modification was not as successful as hoped for. I think you need a real good reason to go to a wider cabin. On the other hand, I never heard Mike complain about visibility issues, and we did sail for 6 days in cold rain... but Mike is definitely not the complaining kind.
