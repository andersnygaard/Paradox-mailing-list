I've noticed, what I consider, a small anomaly on the plans.

Sheet 1 shows the sail with the original sail. The foot of the sail is 3350 and the boom (including furling spool) would appear to be approx 3450mm i.e. about 100mm longer than the foot.

Sheet 12, spar details, shows the boom as 3650, that's a whole 200 mm longer than above. 

As I'm going to use the new sail, which has a foot of 3180 I'd say that my boom only needs to be about 3300 long making it currently 350 oversize, which is a considerable chunk to carry unnecessarily.

Have I missed something critical? does the boom really need to have the extra 200 mm? It would be nice to know before I chop it off!
