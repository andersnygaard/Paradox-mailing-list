Hi.

I have considered oars that would be used standing up, facing 
forward. Once the hatch was opened oarlock brackets could be attached 
to the sides of the opening, well forward. I believe there would be 
room to swing the oars through a sufficiently large arc to provide 
adequate propulsion. I have not experimented with this but have 
considered it as it would get over some of the drawbacks of the 
yuloh. Specifically, keeping the head into the wind when it pipes up 
and stopping/reversing when manoeuvring at close quarters.

When I built Little Jim I had not had much experience sailing (my 
background consisted mainly of motor boats) so I determined not to 
have a motor in the first year as then I would *have* to learn to 
sail. This forced me to use the yuloh for non-sailing manoeuvring and 
I eventually became quite proficient.

As Bill said, I now have a small electric trolling motor but, as this 
is stowed so as to be awkward to get to, it is only used when sail or 
yuloh have failed.


Hoping for calm nights
