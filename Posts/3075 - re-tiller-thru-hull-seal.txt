Hi Bill

I'll try a scuba shop 'though I doubt there is one local. I live right in the middle of England. 
The nearest water is the narrow canal which is about 5' deep, less the shopping trolleys, in 
the centre of the channel on a really wet day :0)

Could I nail a piece of leather with a slit in it on the transom, in conjunction with my bug 
net? I have copper nails and a nice piece of 3mm hide. Do you treat leather for exposure to 
seawater? Anybody know? I bought this half cow of eBay for doing the mast and the sail/
yard.

Made my tack strop cleat. Came out a bit different to the plan but, hey, it's mine :0) When 
things are going well this boatbuilding is great fun. I'm looking forward to my next 
project.

Derek
