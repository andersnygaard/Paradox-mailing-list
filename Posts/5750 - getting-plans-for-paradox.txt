Subject: Getting Plans for Paradox

I'm new to this group and new to sailing, but I think I would like to build a Paradox - if I can figure out how to get a copy of the plans. The two email addresses that claim to have plans and a manual seem to be invalid. All email addressed to them gets returned as undeliverable.

Can someone tell me how to get a copy of the plans, please?

Thanks,
Dave B.
