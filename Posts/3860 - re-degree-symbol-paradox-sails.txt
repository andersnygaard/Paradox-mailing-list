You're welcome.  I might have mentioned "alt" as well, as my option key says that t=BA=BA, but in smaller letters.  I have an iBook also - still plugging along after over five years of hard service.  Like "dog years" (but applied to a laptop) that must be the equivalent of about 80 years old for a human ;-)
