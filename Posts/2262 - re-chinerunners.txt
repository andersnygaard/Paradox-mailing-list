Sounds plausible to me. I really don't know what I meant with the convexities, now that I've been thinking of it. Wonder what's happening when a Paradox skids sideways down a wave. Is the chinerunner on or in the water? What about laminar versus turbulent flow on each side of the CR? and the resulting preassure difference. Does the curvature mean anything here? Besides, as far as I've understood, when a boat trips under these circumstances it's because the water's surface velocity is higher than deeper down, thus causing a torque on a conventional hull. But how about Paradox? Doesn't it just flow with the surface water, thus making the CR obsolete, just then???
