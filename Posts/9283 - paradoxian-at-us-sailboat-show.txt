Subject: Paradoxian at US sailboat show

Hello Paradoxians,

Throwing it out here; I'll be at the Annapolis Sailboat show this weekend, but now with my paradox - some year I hope - and would like to meet other paradoxians who may be attending. Send me an email. We can talk Paradox and all things nautical. More infor at link below.

If there are paradox meetup or events, please post.
