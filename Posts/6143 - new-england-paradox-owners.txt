Subject: New England Paradox owners

Hello,

My name is Michael McCarthy, of Newport, RI.

I have just received my Paradox plans, along with the building descriptions written by the late Don Elliott, furnished by his wife. Both arrived quite quickly, even considering this past Veterans Day holiday!

My plans to build are slow in coming together. To begin with, I am going to raise funds, but in no particular hurry, as to make sure this all goes through smoothly. I am also a Reservist, and there is a firm probability that I may deploy (again) so I am developing my plans in a stretched out manner so my expectations aren't too stiff.

I am hoping to touch base with owners of Paradox in the New England area. If anyone is feeling generous, come appropriate weather this next Spring I am hoping to offer a trade of a few days good labor (yard clean-up, boat day work, home repair?) for the opportunity to cruise a day or so in a Paradox. My primary interest is just to see how she sails! Also, if anyone is a fan of Newport, as of May 1st, my 25ft C&amp;C Mk1 "Kestrel" will be back on her mooring, so I would be honored to trade vessels for a day or so, so that someone could get the chance to have a good time in Narragansett Bay (and her nearby waters). Of course, you could always enjoy the Bay in your Paradox, but I'd stock my cooler with the beverage of your choice to sweeten the pot!

Please contact me via email if this idea doesn't sound to crazy. I appreciate your correspondence! I would like to get an idea of how popular this design is around here!
