I’m 5’6” and I travel in mine
I can’t see how much stuff you would need to overload a Paradox
If you travel as I do a few days at a time there is room to spare
I slept well on the floor and although I’m not as agile as I once was, (I’m 63 years old), I can get to all the corners of the hull if needed
Sleeping at anchor is not my favourite but I have done it
Hope someone is out sailing now

I am a big guy at 6' and 240 lbs I have day sailed with myself and 120 lb female with one inside steering the other can lean up against the front of the cabin on the starboard side, I am too claustrophobic to think of sleeping in it laying on floor.

There is no way that two people could cruise on a Paradox. It's only just doable for one!

You'd better tell that to the designer then :-)
Or maybe mention it directly to his wife who accompanied him on some of his Bahama trips...
