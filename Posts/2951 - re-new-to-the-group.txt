It's been very peaceful here with out him and banning him had nothing to do with free speech Derek, it was his attacks on people that set everyone off. I had so many members contact me off list to complain or say they were leaving because of him that something had to be done. He is still out there for any one wanting his counsel so I feel it is best to leave things as they are.
