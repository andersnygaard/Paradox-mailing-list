Subject: Opinions sought from the offshore experienced

A preface to my post: I'm not suggesting any changes to the salient features of Paradox. 

If one considered using Paradox as an offshore microcruiser, would any of the following items add value to its already extensive list of safety features? I've noticed that many sailors consider them essential to offshore sailing.

-- A sprayhood
-- A leecloth system (I'm imagining a few seatbelts securely connected to the floorboards -- some for seated positions, some for sleep.)
-- A small windvane. Is it even possible to fit one to Paradox?
-- A spare rudder (compact, stowable emergency rudder)
-- A foam filled mast
-- Toerails and handholds, in case you have crawl around on deck at sea.
-- Smaller lexan windows or backing supports for the windows, to lessen the chance of storm waves bashing them in.

Would these features tip the scales in favor of sailing offshore in Paradox?
