Subject: Re: replacing wood spars for aluminum

I'd guess about the same as used for a Sunfish would probably work-at least for a while! I think that the max stress at the partners will be the most vulnerable place...no sharp edges there.
But why not wood? It floats! and could just be left square with slightly radiussed edges to allow the paint to stay on. Square is actually the strongest- for the same weight.
Cheers,
Alan.
