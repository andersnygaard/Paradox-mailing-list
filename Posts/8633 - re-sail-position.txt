Subject: Re: Sail position

Thanks Alastair,
Great to hear there's no pointing discrepancy, I only ask as there is on my lugsail dinghy.
I forgot to mention my other concern re off centre sail; some people have mentioned the boat's reluctance to tack from port to starboard ( I think you yourself have previously mentioned shifting your weight forward when tacking to help this) -might this be solved by siting the sail on the centre line?
I certainly don't want to meddle as "if it 'aint bust don't fix it..", I'm just thinking aloud..
Regards
Paul
