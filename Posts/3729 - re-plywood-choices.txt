Subject: Re: Plywood Choices

Hello Stephen. My name really Chris. Joe_mapango is just a screen name. I grew up overseas, and mapango was my nickname (given to me by my brother and sister). It means toothless or ape in Swahilli (or Bugandan, I forget). So I became Joe Ape! (or Joe toothless!)

Anyway, think for getting back to me and your assistance. I checked out the "study plans" file area. I see I can build out of ex grade plywood. That will make starting this thing easier to justify!

I have never built a real boat before, and I may be kidding myself, but I think I could. When I was younger I built many RC planes and boats, and I think that gives me some perspective. I have all the space I need, and a fair amount of tools. Time and money are what I lack the most, but those factors pervade my entire life. Why let them bother me now! A concrete floor would be nice, but that also means paying someone to pour a 12X30 pad in my barn (covers one bay!), I'm sure that's not cheap. I sent an Email to the plans guy to confirm they are available, price, and payment type. I'm looking forward to seeing them.

Have a great week. Keep the list informed of your progress.

Chris Curtis
