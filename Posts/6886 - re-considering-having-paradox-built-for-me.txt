Subject: Re: Considering Having Paradox Built for Me.

A modification I would recommend is beefing up the tack system. I added hardwood, which I epoxied to the standard fittings to make them stronger. You can see a photo by going to Faith's folder in the photo albums.

The standard hatch system works well and does not leak, if made according to plan.

I occasionally took another person sailing for a few hours, but I felt the boat was too cramped for more than one person. Doing away with the bins on either side of the boat would make more room for day sailing, but that would not help when it comes to cruising single-handed, because secure stowage space is required for provisions and gear.

The standard ventilation is more than adequate for temperate climes.

If I were building another Paradox, I think I would have a single fold-down washboard with a port in it, instead of the rear window. Such an arrangement would give better access, and provide a nice place to sit when sailing during fine weather. A removable hinged tiller extension would be all you would need to steer the boat from that position.

I could not have done the serious coastal cruising I did with Faith, had I not had an outboard engine. The yuloh could only be used in calm conditions, and was dreadfully slow by comparison with the engine.

Paradox is a time-comsuming vessel to build. If she is to be built by a professional boatbuilder, she'll cost a mint, because of the time involved.

Best wishes,
Bill.
