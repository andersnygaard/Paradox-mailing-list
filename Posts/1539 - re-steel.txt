Nels, 

What Ive learned here and with the whole paradox thing, is exatly that, a paradox, and somebody saying you cant do that, it cant be done drives one to do it, from Matt breaking the rules and doing it because he wasnt encumbered in his creativity and thinking by the conventional rules, as well as others like Sven, Bolger. I too have the same spirit.
