Subject: Re: Hey Alaistar (and others). What did you use to thicken your epoxy and how is going after all these years?

I guess I didnt remember this quite well but good information. I remember though you said once about using an angle grinder everywhere. Come on, at least this I am remembering right?

Something about epoxy being stronger than wood..

Thanks
