Subject: Re: Not to beat a dead horse... but size matters

Just want to add little to my previous post:
The length of the main cabin is 190cm. At 6'3", that makes me about 191cm. That's barely tolerable for even one night. Those who are shorter probably have little idea what it's like to sleep wedged in from head to foot.
Of course it's vaguely possible to stretch out into the forepeak, but, as designed, number two bulkhead has a lower lip about 7" high.
The other thing that was clearly obvious was trying to get my frame to reach into the forepeak. It was like being locked in a refrigerator and trying to turn around. I don't even want to imagine what that would be like in any kind of waves.
I want to be clear: this is not at all a criticism of Paradox--just my reality of being 6'3" in a tiny boat.
