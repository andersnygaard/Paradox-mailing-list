Nels,

The Wiley ports have wedges to hold them open or closed, don't they.
How about a different set of wedges to be used on both sides of the
panel to wedge it in an intermediate position.

Sincerely,
Gene T.

True, that would be the best way to do it. Unfortunately Micro plans
called for the baffles to be glued in permanently - so not a "true"
wiley port. Also my choice would be to make the adjustable baffles from
clear polycarbonate so you can see through them and let light in.
