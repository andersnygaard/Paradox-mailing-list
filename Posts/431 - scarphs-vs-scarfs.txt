Excuse my nit! :)

Scarf is something you do to food, or something worn on your head or around your shoulders! Scarph is the joining together of two pieces of wood!


So, you'll excuse me while I scarf my dinner, put a scarf on my head and go and scarph some wood! :P

Cabin feverish in Seattle... It is NOT supposed to snow here in the lowlands in MARCH!
