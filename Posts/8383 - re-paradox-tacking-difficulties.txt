I suspect the tacking difficulties you (we, when Mini is eventually finished) can mainly be attributed to Paradox's submerged forefoot.  I know that Phil Bolger was insistent that sharpies needed to have their forefoot above the water to enable them to tack and I remember once I had a friend stand on the bow of my Philsboat and when he submerged it's forefoot we just kept going in a straight line!

But there are trade-offs to everything. There's been frequent mentions on this group about how Paradox can maintain course for minutes at a time - I bet if its forefoot was above the water that wouldn't be happening and one thing that I'm really looking forward to is no more pounding, particularly when at anchor. I'm also hoping to find that sailing at anchor isn't an issue, particularly if lying to a sea anchor.

In addition to keeping way on and not trying to turn too quickly perhaps keeping your body on the outside of the curve rather than the inside might help when tacking. That will make the boat heel a lot more - I think they refer to it as roll tacking, but then again Paradox's hard chines and narrow hull might cancel out those kinds of weight shifts.

Perhaps I'll just have to accept that in rough water, tacking isn't an option.

Cheers,
