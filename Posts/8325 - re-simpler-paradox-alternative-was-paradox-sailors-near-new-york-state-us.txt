Very nice job! I like the duck decoy up on the bow! I would be interested in the details of your build. Do you have rough sketches with dimensions of your design, as well as a lot more pictures! Do your cabin sides extend to the full 4-foot beam? Will 2 adults fit inside for sailing? Please tell us more!

Thanks,

Dave
