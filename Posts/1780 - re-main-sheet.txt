Subject: Re: Main Sheet

I took a picture of the lead picture from the July Sailing Magazine, reversed it so it is correct, and placed it in the files menu. It shows the method of sheeting the sail that Matt has on his boat, which I understand is different from the plans. It's a big file so you can see the sheet, so I'll probably take it down in a few days.

The July Magazine can be ordered online from http://www.sailingonline.com/

It's worth getting as it has more good picture of Paradox and of some sailing canoes, the type of boat I currently own
