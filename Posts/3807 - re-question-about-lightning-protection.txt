Copper is a great anti fouling, you could cover the whole bottom and be done with anti fouling problems and yearly maintenance.

Ahh, I get it now. I saw your vacuum-bagging setup, but thought it was with a layer of glass over the flashing. Problem solved!
Now I'm curious: does the exposed copper provide any noticeable 
anti-fouling properties? I was tempted to use copper powder in the bottom epoxy, but I think that will have to wait for a different season. Plenty else to get done first!

Thanks, Matt

Hi Matt,

The copper strip is a grounding plane and must be in the water. Without taking the time to go look I think that I have some pictures in the files section showing how I tackled it. If memory serves me I got the copper from a piece of flashing bought at a roofing supply house. After cutting it to size I drilled 3/16 inch holes about every six inches around the edges and then countersunk the out side. It was then vacuum bagged to the hull (you can use any small vacuum source for this) and the counter sunk holes act like epoxy rivets to give it a good mechanical bonding as well as the glued inside surface. The flashing is about 1/16 inch thick so I then covered the lot with micro balloons and sanded it fair to the bottom.

Hope this helps

Glen

The copper flashing: beneath the roving (against the wood), beneath the bottom paint but on top of the glass, or exposed to the water?

Working on the chine runners right now, then.. rollover time!
