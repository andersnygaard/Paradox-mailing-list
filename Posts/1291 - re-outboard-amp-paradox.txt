I use a 2 hp Honda on Whisper, works great. You have to be careful about the weight. I was using a 58 lb 4 hp Yamaha, I could not get her balanced out right for sailing. No problem with the Honda, It will push her  at 4 or 5 Knots at a little over half throttle

I also would be interested in knowing if anyone has fitted an outboard to a Paradox and with what results. I seem to recall seeing a photo of Little Cruiser with one. Was the outboard on Little Cruiser found to be unsatisfactory in some way? Anyone ---- ? Cheers, Alan
