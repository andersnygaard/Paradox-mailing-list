I have been through both the Erie canal and 1000 ils. There are sections of both that have over 3 knot current. I would go so far as to say a human could not propel a Paradox up the Erie. 1000 Islands may be possible because it's wide and I was in a deep draft sailboat -near the shipping channel. 

IMHO doing the great loop in a Paradox would be a huge mistake. With less time and energy you could sail ALL of the best cruising grounds in north america -IN THE BEST SEASONS! Sailing the industrial wastelands of the ICW and Miss. is for chumps with boats too big to trailer. If you are looking to do it for bragging rights let me tell you there are two kinds of people -those that don't know how hard it is and think you are a fool, and then there are the few that know how hard it is, who KNOW you are a fool.
