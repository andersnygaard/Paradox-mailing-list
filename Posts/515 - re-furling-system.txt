Hi David,

The topping lift system has not given me any problems since I last reported on it. It has worked so well that I will now lead it inside with the other lines when I can get back to it. 

I haven't run the topping lift line inside yet but have all the details worked out. It will enter just to the inboard side of the furling line through a deck fitting like the halyard, furling and tack line. It will then run to a double block (1 sheave for the furling line the other for the topping lift) on the same U-strap that the furling line block now resides on, then through the vent box beside the furling line to another cam cleat. When the final system is installed I will post a drawing and pictures of it. In the mean time just rig up a make do system as I did and have fun. It took some fiddling before I was satisfied enough to commit to another hole in the deck.
