Subject: Don Elliott

Strange... I was on the paradoxboatbuilders site and reading old post. I found out Don Elliott wrote manuals for other boats so I was curious and google him to find them. I googled "Don Elliott boats" ... look at what I found. http://www.theunion.com/assets/pdf/TU5325316.PDF 
I am sure this isn't our Don he has posted recently. Weird thou huh?
