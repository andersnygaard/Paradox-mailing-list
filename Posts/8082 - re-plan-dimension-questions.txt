Thanks for the replies.

1. All the curves in the BH openings were drawn with 100mm rad, the sides and crown are different. 

2. I added the tiller line holes, thanks I missed those.

3. I included an Exhibit explaining my problems creating the transom. (just using the 25x45mm deck beam seems to come up short 9 or 10 mm)

4. I will try to stick to the plans as close as possible regarding the deck beams.

Thanks a bunch.

I started drawing Paradox in cad a few days ago and I have a couple questions about dimensions, bulkhead deck curves and bulkhead openings.

Two Exhibits in .pdf are attached to help explain and illustrate.

I'm very excited to complete this drawing and am very thankful to anyone that can help me out.

Best wishes,

John
