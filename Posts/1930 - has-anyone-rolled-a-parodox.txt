Subject: Has anyone rolled a parodox ?
To: paradoxbuilders@yahoogroups.com

Was wondering what would happen if one was to get out in some big seas 15 to 20 feet. Could the boat survive multiple rolls or a end over end stern over bow? Last week we had a big storm move through and a friend was on the catalina ferry that he takes back and fourth almost every week. He said the seas were at least 15 feet and breaking one of the worst rides he has ever had in a long time.

Has anyone sailed to Hawaii in a paradox? How about sailing from Long Beach California to the tip of Baja Mexico and back practical or not?

Just some arm chair sailing for thought.
