Subject: Re: New file uploaded to paradoxbuilders - boat size

Nels,
Rough when you own a gold plater and can't put the knife to it (I  
couldn't, not to that beauty).  I'm just adjusting my bulkheads to  
temporarily attached sides on my Micro Navigator.  That is one big  
boat.  Why did I question if it would be big enough.  It is only a  
little longer than the Paradox but is definitely in a much larger  
size class.  I think 2 paradoxi could sit in it side by side.   
Thinking about it no they won't.  2 feet too much width.  I guess  
paradox ain't so small either...

Sincerely,
Gene T.
