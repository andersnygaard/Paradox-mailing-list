My recommendation for trailers for Paradox and Little Cruiser is to get a used one that is fairly heavy duty. The nice thing is that with their flat bottoms, these little boats can use just about anything from a flatbed to a custom trailer with some simple modifications. I used a lightweight to medium duty trailer (rated at 1400 lbs), and I have been welding gussets and reenforcements plates ever since. Bouncing down the road and across railroad tracks with a full load can crack the welds. Also, after several blow-outs with the original skinny 4" x 12" tires, I put on full size trailer tires to match those of the tow vehicle. 

Presently, Little Cruiser is supported on the trailer by two treated 2 x 6 amidship and a 2 x4 board forward. With the axle attached to the top of the leaf springs I can launch at most ramps. On the other hand, Matt Layden was smart. He went out and got a good used heavy duty powerboat trailer with full-sized wheels for cheap.
