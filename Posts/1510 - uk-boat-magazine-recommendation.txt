Fellow Paradox Phans,

Have you ever thumbed through WoodenBoat magazine and wished that they'd write about real boats for real people? If so, take a look at http://www.watercraft.co.uk/. I subscribe to this and another UK magazine, Practical Boat Owner because I find their articles are much more relevant to the type of boating that I do, and the type of boat building I can afford. I'm not connected to either magazine but if you feel like the big American glossies have forgotten about you, you might try one of these.
