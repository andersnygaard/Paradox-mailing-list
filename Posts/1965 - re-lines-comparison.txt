Hi Paul,

Have you seen Chuck Merrell's website that has some information about his Jesse Cooper? 

http://www.boatdesign.com/tomboy/index.htm

Seems like Chuck began a re-design, but went with a MICRO type keel. One of the problems with the design was that the 480 pounds of internal ballast was not enough and it actually took 1200 to bring it near the DWL. It might be that even more would be needed to get the hull immersed enough to make chine runners effective. By the time you added enough weight the bow would start to dig in.

Bolger decided to go with a whole new design using leeboards and he first designed the Martha Jane, with water ballast and then the AS19 (internal ballast) that both would probably work with chine runners. The AS19 is apparently really fast, but the scoop bow was kinda weird!

Bolger then designed the AS29 that has swinging bilge keels. Then the AS38 with a centerboard I believe. His newer designs all seemt to be like BRIS with a centerboard far fw'd and big rudders.

Cheers, Nels
