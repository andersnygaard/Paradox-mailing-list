Front window, cabin sides and rear are all held in place with tacks and clamps, and tomorrow I intend to cut the cabin roof (deck?) but things went so well today that they are bound to go wrong soon. I was only able to get 3mm Lexan in offcuts for the side windows and a thicker piece for the front window.
