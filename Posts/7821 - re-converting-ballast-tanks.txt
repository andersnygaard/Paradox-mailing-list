Subject: Re: Converting ballast tanks

You'll be replacing the water ballast with semi-permanent ballast.
That will increase the trailer loading.

I've always been in two minds about water ballast.
The plumbing is complicated.
If it's drinking water you lose ballast as you cruise.
It occupies 11 times the space of lead.
But it does keep the trailer weight down.

I never keep drinking water in one large container:  I prefer several small containers,  such as 2pint and 4pint plastic milk bottles.
Contamination is confined to one or two small containers,  which can be thrown away.
