Another alternative to the expensive SSB/Computer/Modem setup is to use PocketMail. In this case you use a small electronic organizer ($99) to send/receive e-mail over the phone lines. There are 1-800 access numbers and the device can be used with any phone. Of course there is a monthly access fee which runs about $12.50/month. Over the past few years we've seen quite a few cruisers using this system in the Bahamas.
