I fixed the extra arrows and added Alastair's message to the mast drawing. I tried to put it in the files section of this group but it never showed up.

Here it is on my Flickr page.

If posting this edited drawing is violating any rules, let me know and I'll remove it. I still don't understand it but having the drawing and the explanation on one page may help. I'm not currently building this boat but still want to know how the mast is put together in case I ever do.
