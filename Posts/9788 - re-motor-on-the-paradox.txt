Thank you, La Ciudad.

You pictures prompted me to check out the additional photos in your photo album in this forum. Appreciate the amount of photos you uploaded. Great way for others to see different configurations of the dox. Your solution does look like it would keep the sheet above the motor.

Where do you sail and when do you find using the motor the most?

Thank you,

Deric
