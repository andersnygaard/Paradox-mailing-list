Well, thanks Glen. I'll give the sail a go and no doubt it will need doctoring as you've suggested.

I'm making good progress with this fine weather we having here in the UK, but tomorrow is out because of family requirements.  I've cut the cabin top panels, but before I attach them I need to make the coaming/drip pieces.

Bill.
