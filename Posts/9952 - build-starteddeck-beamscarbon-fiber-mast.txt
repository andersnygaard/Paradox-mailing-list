Finally have the workshop (1/2) 2 car garage setup and built a jig for deck beam lamination construction to begin. Warming the space with 2 electric fan/heaters. I plan on using 5-25mm x 9mm plywood strips to build laminated deck beams.

With the deck beam(s) curve it is hard to determine how much longer to make the strips without making them excessively long and wasting material before cutting to proper length but it also might be easier to make all ~7? Exactly the same and cutting down the shorter ones when mounting to smaller bulkheads. Any suggestions on way to go with these?

Alao I=E2=80=99ve been getting some ideas from a guy building a 14=E2=80=99 Ocean Capable Small Sailboat (OCSS) on YouTube. One of his ideas is to incorporate a Carbon Fiber mast. What are thoughts on using a Carbon Fiber mast?

Thanks
Erik
