Hi Al,

I guess when you get this you will have returned from your latest cruise and will fill us in on how it went, so here's wishing you a belated good time. Could you describe your topping lift arrangement in a little more detail, I didn't quite understand how the main halyard lifts the boom. Could it be that you have a tie around the sail until you are ready to unfurl?
