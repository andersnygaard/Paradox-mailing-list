Hi All;

I am also going to be building a Paradox. Being a first time boat builder I decided to start with something a little easier. I started with a Michalak Piccup Pram.

It would probably take a few thousand words for me to tell you all I have learned about epoxy, epoxy fiberglass joints, cutting curves in plywood (I can actually split the line on a curved cut with a circular saw now), etc., etc.

The learning curve included mixing up epoxy wrong a few times. "Finding out what floating the tape meant." Things I was much happier doing on a boat where the most any mistake could cost me was $15 and a few hours to correct.

Soon I will be applying fiberglass sheathing on the bottom of my pram. This will also be a first for me. I will be amazed if I do everything right the first time.

When you were first learning to drive, my bet is that you did not start on the LA freeway system during business hours, even though you could have. I know I started in an empty Mall parking lot.

To answer Orpdh's question about the chine runners . . . I built my runners out of small pieces of fir 2x4 cut to shape and glued along the overhang. 

So did you pre-manufacture them with the curves already in, or did you bend them into place?

In actually sailing paradox, do the chine runners take much abuse?  

Are the chine runners typically what grounds the first?
