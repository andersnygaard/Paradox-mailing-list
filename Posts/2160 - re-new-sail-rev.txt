Hi Alastair,

How does Paradox handle the big motorboat waves in shallow water? Do you have to change course to deal with the big motorboat waves or just maintain course?

How does is behave in a following sea also?

As one of those who has experienced the slow tacking of a Paradox I would like to put it in perspective.

Compared to a centre-board dinghy Paradox is sluggish when coming about.

Paradox is a heavy displacement craft (14ft long and over half a ton). It has the equivalent of a full length keel. 

I have no experience of the tacking ability of other heavy displacement craft with full length keels, but I would suggest that Paradox probably behaves as would be expected from the numbers.
