Subject: Re: Anchoring


I do as John Starkie sugests. I can flick the rope into the fairlead at the bow with a 6 foot boat hook without climbing out of the cabin.
You can anchor from the stern for a short time OK but there can be some noise as waves break against the transom.

Top tip. Have the rudder up while deploying or recovering the anchor.


Best
