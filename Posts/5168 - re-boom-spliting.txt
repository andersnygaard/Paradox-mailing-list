I put a couple of turns of glass tape around the end of my boom. I also cut a slot about 60mm in from the end of the boom to allow the tang bolt to be retained with a lock nut. No problems so far. The only change I would make next time would be to shape the very end (last centimeter) of the boom down to a circle so only one stainless washer would be needed to keep the tang clear of the boom end. You get some play of the tang If you have the bolt loose enough to allow free turning of the boom. Andrew Graham

Subject: [paradoxbuilders] Boom spliting

A question for you guys with finished boats. Concerning the Boom. Is there any trouble with the bolt for the mainsheet tang, splitting the wood or cracking. Bill, you mentioned that the bolt fell out? I'm at a point when I could add a band of fiberglass around the end of the boom, as long as I'm fiberglassing the reefing spool too. Any thoughts appreciated. Steve Yahn
