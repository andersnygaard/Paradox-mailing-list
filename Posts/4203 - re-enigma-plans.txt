Subject: Re: Enigma Plans?

Just as a follow on.
I was listening to the Furledsails podcast #73 http://furledsails.com/article.php3?article=3D702, the interview with Steve Issac (Chief at Watertribes). This is a really interesting interview and Matt gets numerous mentions throughout. What I hadn't realised, was that Matt has been working closely with Steve in the design of Steve's new boat, Tridarka Raider, which he is building and hopes to use in this years Everglades challenge (if he finishes in time!) 
http://www.tridarkaraider.com/

This maybe one of the many reasons why Matt hasn't got round to producing the Enigma Plans yet.

The interview is worth a listen and Steve's building Blog at http://chief.tridarkaraider.com/ is fascinating to see how quick he is putting this thing together.

Also worth a listen are the microcruising podcasts with Dave and Mindy 
http://furledsails.com/article.php3?article=3D674 and http://furledsails.com/article.php3?article=3D675.

Cheers
