Subject: Re: Steel?

By oilcan you mean dent up?? I would go with a thicker plate for bottom, 3/16th? or so, whatever would be about the same as the target weight.

Another thing would be I think with steel we could come up with a good water tank system that's VERY cleanable making gasketed hatch cover should be easy. I do not like those production type covers.

Also, the frame tubing is hollow. This will aid in buoyancy if flooded.
