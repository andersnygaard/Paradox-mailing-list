Hi William,

I also had no end of trouble with this issue during my first season with Iota, which was completely solved by rebuilding the furling mechanism exactly according to plan.  I have posted many details in the comments of the photos in the Iota album.  After having tried a topping lift and getting the sail mixed up in it several times in difficult winds, I was really glad to get rid of it.  I now use what could be called  a half-topping-lift, which simply consists of tying the topping lift halyard directly to the rounded end of the 1/2 inch stainless steel bar coming out of the roller. This relieves most of the weight of the boom-yard-sail and tends to bring the mechanism closer to the mast, without the hassle of the Y rope of the typical topping lift.  But I think Peter is right, you must first verify that there is no binding whatsoever- especially where the furling rope goes through the fairlead near the roller.  It helps to oversize this fairlead.  Mine is 3/4 inch, as you will see in the photos in the Iota album. I can easily use the system without the aid of the half-topping-lift, but it’s easier with it.

Hope this helps. 

André-François
