Subject: Re: Stitch and glue Paradox?

I did the S&G paradox also.

I scarfed the panels for the sides and bottom, used temporary bracing to get the correct side shape, then used West epoxy and resin with their brown thickener to create the fillets, then added two strips of 6 oz fiberglass tape on top of the fillets. Then, as you suggest, I made the bulkheads out of plywood (they're cut to fit, once the sides and bottom and in place), with little cut outs at the corners to clear the now existing fillets (they also act as limber holes) and used the same technique to join the bulkheads to the sides. I used thin plastic cable ties as the S&G fasteners - they were covered by the fillet on the inside and on the outside I trimmed them flush with the plywood, then touched the bit that inevitably pokes up from the plywood with the tip of a soldering iron. That causes the cable tie to melt and burble back into the plywood and you can then fill in the tiny hole with resin. The whole process works a treat.

I built it in the UK about 10 years ago, sailed it around the coast around Cornwall, and then sold it to a guy when I came back to the states. If you don't mind sailing by yourself (or with a very close friend) it's the best boat to sail I've ever had. Easy to launch, easy to store, easy to sail, and extremely comfortable.
