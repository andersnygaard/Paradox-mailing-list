Subject: Sven's book, concluded

Hello,

I've discussed the cooperative translation project with Sven. After some contemplation, he rejected the thought of putting one of his big investments in the cyberspace. One Paradoxchapter is okay, but the whole book is not. This is understandable to me. The publisher probably has opinions and should be interested in finding an American counterpart. Why don't some of you nag a little? Sven is intensely working on his new boat. The outside lamination should be ready by now. He is aiming for The Azores, where he will write his next book, now in English.

Sven also asked me to let you know that Matt thought the Paradoxchapter should have mentioned the large rudder's importance to lateral resistance.

My own ParaPlastic now has sides and a bottom and looks like a boat all of a sudden. The outside lamination should take place this coming weekend, hopefully. If I can force all the youths to help me.

Best regards,

Kjell Karlsson
