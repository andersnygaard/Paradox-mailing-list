Subject: My shopping list?

The weather's warming up, and I've nearly rebuilt my boat shed, so I've been pricing up materials for my build.

I've found 3 sources of marine ply, all BS1088.

Robbins basic comes to =A3548, marineply.com "Far eastern" =A3252 and Okume at =A3472. (2x18,4x12,3x9,1x6mm)

At half the price the Far Eastern sounds attractive.
Has any one experience of the product? Waht would be the disadvantages of using it (weight, strength, workability)knowing that Matt only spec'd AC Exterior for the vessel.

Can any one guesstimate how much epoxy resin I would require to build and sheath the boat? (litres, gallons, bushels or West C packs).

TIA

Pete
