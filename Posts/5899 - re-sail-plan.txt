Subject: Re: sail plan

I also would think that a Paradox sail of that size , when reefed, would result in quite a large, and perhaps sloppy, roll of canvas around the boom when fully reefed.

Going with a cat yawl rig I might consider the sail plan that Little Cruiser uses for the main.

Just a thought - but I like that sail plan.

One could maybe inquire with Matt for his thoughts in that regard.
