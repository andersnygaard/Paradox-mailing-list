In the following picture you can see the bronze rod stock used in the tips of the rudder and the yuloh. Also note the string that runs over the cleats to prevent the sheet from catching. 

I see he has also changed the sheeting arrangement. I hadn't thought of the sheets catching the cleats. If all goes well I shall find out tomorrow if it a serious problem as I should be launching Little Jim in the morning.

Hoping for calm nights
