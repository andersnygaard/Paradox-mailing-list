I mispoke when I said " My process of operating the furler always begins with tightening up the topping lift as tight as I can get it just prior to operating the furler, and after the furler operation is done, releasing the tension on the furler so that it doesn't impede the sail shape (especially off the wind)."

I don't ease the tension on the furling ....  I ease the tension on the TOPPING LIFT so as not to impede the shape, especially off the wind.

Sorry bout that!!!  :-)
