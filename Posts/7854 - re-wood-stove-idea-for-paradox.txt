No not tried that Alastair..
I find that the drips make the sleeping bag a little damp, which is not nice.
If the day is sunny and I'm not busy sailing somewhere,  I can hoist the sleeping bag up with the topping lift for a good airing,  which  freshens it up nicely after a couple of hours.
But if I'm sailing, or the weather is damp,  I have to put it back into its storage bag as is. 
So it tends to  get musty after a few days of use.

The transparent hatch panel is the only source of dripping condensation which bothers me. The condensation on the side windows falls into the little channels put there to catch it, so not a problem. 

Michalsbr:
I've never seen much condensation on the interior painted plywood panels,  so I doubt the heat loss through the plywood is a major factor. Don't forget that the UK isn't a very cold country by American standards, so the temperature gradient through the thickness of plywood  isn't great.

Best
