Subject: Tips for removing a Paradox from a trailer

Hi Deric and other Paradox lovers,

When I had to remove my Paradox from the trailer and put it back on again, I simply called my neighbour the farmer and asked him to come over with his tractor.

With two slings at each end of the boat and a strong rope tied between the two slings, it was a piece of cake for him to lift the boat straight up as I removed the trailer and replaced it with some logs for the boat to sit on.  I then rolled the boat into the shop using the logs as rollers.  I did all this with the permanent ballast in my boat without any trouble.

From there it is easy to use a jack to lift the boat higher one end at a time to raise it enough to put support beams under it to work on the bottom.

Salut!
