Subject: Re: Sleep two in a Paradox?

It is 930mm (37.2") wide X 1900mm (76") long. It is possible to sleep two normal sized (170lb) people if you love each other, but that is not the issue. Lets say it's time to fix dinner and it is raining outside. Kind of hard to get around and stay out of the other persons way. In the past when my wife and I have cruised in our Paradox we have pitched a tent ashore and had a lot of fun sailing and exploring and then returning to base camp. I can't even imagine living together in such a tight space with out the ability to get off the boat say in the evening and walk around. On the other hand, I have spent up to 5 days aboard quite comfortably without ever getting off.
