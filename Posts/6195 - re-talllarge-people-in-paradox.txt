I doubt if your height is, of itself, a problem. If the sleeping space is too short then it is possible to modify the opening through to the forward storage so that it is on the same level as the cabin sole, and your feet can then stick through. I have made this mod to my boat, but for other reasons.

It is probably more of a question of how supple you are. In bad weather you will be sitting inside and moving about may require some contortions.

That said, I don't think that I have ever heard any owners complaining that it is too cramped. I, at 5'6" and 180lb find it quite roomy.
