Hi Pete.

Good to here you are getting into second gear with JoHanna. Take it easy and if you get stuck, Al and Bill are only a few taps away.

Sawn is the way to go and for about £35 of the £300 you saved will buy an electric hand planer that will take off the rough bits. With your boat now under way there must be, I suppose about the same number od PARADOX's in the States as in the UK.

Just remenber, a sharp tool is less likly to cause an accident than a blunt one.

I have just been to LIDL and bought one of their PortaCrappers for only £30 and it is well made plus looks just as good as the PortaPotti. I walked out with three other guys also carrying one and we all started making jokes about it. Make a great seat for looking out of the hatch.
