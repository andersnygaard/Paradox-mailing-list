Subject: Re: Enuf Epoxy

I would try a test spot and after it hardens dig at it a bit to see if it is solid all the way, if it isn't, I would clean it all off with acetone and put another layer on.

Now the big question! Should I apply a coat of epoxy over the whole tacky hull bottom and leave it at that? Con:- if it all peels off first time I beach her the hull is fairly unprotected Pro:- save all the stripping off and cost of new biax which although still tacky to the touch seems to be stuck to glass mat on sides where I turned it over the edge, can always redo it next year if all goes wrong - got three years until the big trip.

All advice welcome from experience epoxiers. I've got 36 hours to consider this because I'm off to a stately home tomorrow. As a National Trust member, it is my middle-class duty to help the upper classes maintain their fancy drums in the manner to which they have too long been accustomed.

Cheers....... Derek
