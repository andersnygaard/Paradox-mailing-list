Well I haven't started to build yet.

I have the plans and have been studying them, reading many posts on the forum etc.... and have a couple questions.

I am not planning on using the water tanks to hold water as designed. I would like to put many containers/bladders of water in the space instead. In the plans it says the water tank top is structural. 

Can I build it so it has a hinged open top or must I glue the top on and use the round openings for access?

When putting on the deck and bottom panel, there are no measurements like for the side panels. 

Do you just lay on the plywood, tack it down and then trim it to fit? 

For the lightning system, is the bottom copper sheet glued to the bottom of the hull after fiberglass and paint? Can you put fiberglass over the copper sheet?

Thanks,
Sean
