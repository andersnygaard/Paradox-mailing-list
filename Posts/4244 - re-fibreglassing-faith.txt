Subject: Re: Fibreglassing 'Faith'

I'm going to have get a move on, if 'Faith' is to be afloat by the 
beginning of June.  I do have the advantage that I'm retired and if 
the weather is good for building and there are no other pressing 
demands, I'll be enjoying the fun of building.

Cheers,
Bill.
