Hello Glen,

I thought I saw a photo of a 'tillermaster' mounted on one side oz Zoe attached to the steering line. How did that work out??
I am looking forward to seeing sketches and detailed photo's of your vane gear as well.

I don't think this is the case with Paradox Steve, because I lock the steering line down and then only make minimal adjustments every five or ten minutes. But to tell you the truth I have not really tried letting her steer herself for very long. Next time I go out I'll give it a try and let you know if there is anything to your theory.
