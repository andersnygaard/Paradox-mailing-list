Very nice!... I am envious, your build is going way faster than mine did. At this pace you will be in the water as I am placing the finishing touches on my boat. Good work.

I have hesitated sharing this link until I had something to share. Hopefully the build will go faster now, now that I know some people might be watching. haha Anyway, all comments are welcome.
