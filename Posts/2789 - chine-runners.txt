Without trying to get into a debate about if they work, why they work or how they work I though I would throw out this quote from the designer, Matt Layden, about the chine runners:

A note to the uninitiated: The chine runners, or winglets, are small horizontally protruding fins at the chines amidship, that help the hull function as a 'lifting body' to resist leeway. A centerboard or other retractable vertical fin would do the job better, but I have a mental allergy to moving parts and complication. The runners are easy to build and they protect the hull rather than weakening it as a board does. They take up no space in the interior, always an issue in a small cruiser.
