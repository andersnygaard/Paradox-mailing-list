Subject: Re: Enuf's Bottom

My Dad used to say, "If you want a job doing properly you do it yourself."

I've come back home to a hull with white strings of unstripped woven stuff loosely attached, gouges out of the hull bottom (looks like my crab has attacked), and too many empty Stella Artois bottles from my supplies littering the workshop floor.

Not too worry I got some good books at Hay on Wye and Ludlow. Back in the workshop tomorrow. I'm hoping to have Enuf the right way up for the weekend. The five day forecast is pretty good.
