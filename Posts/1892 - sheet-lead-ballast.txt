Subject: Sheet Lead Ballast

I am currently in the very early stages of construction of my PARADOX. Presently I am building a 1 to 5 scale model of the boat which I find helps greatly when it comes to building the real thing.

A question to the group concerning Lead Ballast. I am not keen on having lead pigs cleated down inside the boat and was considering laminating sheet lead (used in building constuction here) between  a 12mm and a 6mm ply sheets which would make up the 18mm ply bottom sheet. I have not yet done the calculations to see if the sheet lead will supply all the required ballest. The technical people at West Systems assure me that I will have no trouble obtaing a bond between lead and ply.

I would welcome comment for and against the idea.
