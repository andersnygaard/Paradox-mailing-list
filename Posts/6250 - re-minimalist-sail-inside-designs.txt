Neither am I. Plus if you were sailing to windward it would act like a big scoop. Kellan Hatch came up with an idea of a solid canopy which slid forward like an aircraft's and closed overlapping the fixed aft part. I reckon a small plastic bath could be a good basis for this.

Is it the Proteus that you had in mind Neil? It has an acrylic bubble hatch.

Talking of Kellan, this coversation is just what should be taking place over on his smallsailboats group as it's drifting away from Paradox and would probably benefit from the wider smallsailboats audience.

No Pete. This one is in the photos section of smallboats under "miscellaneous"
Agree re off topic. I'm not a member of smallsailboats though. I'll join
