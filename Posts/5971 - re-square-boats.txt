Phil Bolger has some designs he calls "Advanced Sharpies" the AS-29 and AS-39 look like that. Scroll down to the middle of this page and look at Matt Nash's Leyenda... and further down Dave Zeiger's and Anke Wagner's Luna

Then browse through these two sites.. remember that many of Matt Layden's Paradox ideas came from Bolger.

Bolger Boats on the Net... http://www.ace.net.au/schooner/sites2.htm

Square Boats Site... http://www.ace.net.au/schooner/sbhome.htm#start

The Square Boats site is interesting in that it promotes box-shaped boats.
