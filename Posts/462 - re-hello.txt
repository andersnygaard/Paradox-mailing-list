Subject: Re: Hello

Hello to all from a new group member. 

I have been interested in Paradox for a while having seen articles here and there and info on the net. I ordered a set of Don Elliot's great drawings and articles which further stoked my desire to build this boat. Only trouble is, I have yet to unravel the mysterious secret of how and where you can actually buy the plans. Can somebody please clue me in.

Thanks

Ernie
