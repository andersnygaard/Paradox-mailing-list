Subject: replacing wood spars for aluminum
To: paradoxbuilders@yahoogroups.com

I intend to use aluminum round tube to replace the wood spars on my (decreased) Paradox style sail.
Obviouis question is of course...what size regarding diameter and whall thickn.
I've done a search on this topic but not much to find.
My sail is something like 7sqm.
Any suggestions,other than using wood spars (grin-grin) are welcome.

thanks
