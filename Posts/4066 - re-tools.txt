To date I have not used a table saw or a bandsaw, but they would 
have been useful.  I've simply used an ordinary rip saw, then planed 
and sanded the sawn wood by hand.  I do not own a Skilsaw, but the 
tool I've found most useful for shaping plywood is an electrical 
hand-held jigsaw; all of my plywood has been shaped with this tool.  
My mast, boom and yuloh were all cut and formed with a rip saw.

Here is a link to the saw I have. It was on sale as a kit along with a
1/4 pad finishing sander for $80 CDN.

For hand sawing consider the Japanese pull-stroke like the ryoba with
hardened teeth. Some examples here:
