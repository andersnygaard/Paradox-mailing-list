Subject: Re: Topping Lift Again

Hi Bill,

I have an eye (not a block) screwed to the aft of the mast with the 2 part span to the port of the mast, but starboard of the sail. I have never felt the ropes get in the the way when stowed. The only real drawback is that you have to be careful not to get the yard on the wrong side of the ropes when starting to haul. Even this is not disastrous, but merely means that the sail has to be slightly reefed as the yard cannot then be hauled right to the mast-head.

On the plus side, the aft span allows you to tie the halyard (and topping lift) away from the mast to stop it slapping against the mast in the night.

Hoping for calm nights,
Al,
Yeovil, England.
