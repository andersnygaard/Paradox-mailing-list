I must assume that the 5's are on the face of a wave.  There were "some" and notice that they were shortly before he got to Venice Inlet.  That last hour was scary.  I could understate that but won't.  I was very aware that a slight steering error on the face of a wave could capsize my boat....in that cold water!

On the first couple of days, whilst on the outside we were seeing consistent 4.5- 4.8 knots reported from his SPOT, with several of 5+. Don't know how much of this was tide derived. Check out the mapper near Venice and south of Marco. There's also some fast times after Key Largo and across Biscayne. I remember seeing 5.6 kts on a few occasions.
