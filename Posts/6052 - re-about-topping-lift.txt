Hi All,

Thank you for kindly reply.

Maybe we can consider to change the sail to junk sail, like "little Cruiser" type which the length of boom will shorter than "Paradox", then the main sheet will no problem to outboard.

You would still have to set it well aft to get the centre of pressure in the right place.

Hoping for calm nights
