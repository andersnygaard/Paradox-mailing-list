Subject: Re: Paradox Max (Manatee)

Hello,

I am curious to know how much larger the Manatee version is compared to the standard version. I have been admiring your work so far and I must say that the cabin top is beautifully constructed.

I also have a query about building a 20% larger boat. Does it require 20% more wood or will it proportionally increase the wood requirement? I have noticed that the original plans fit nicely on 8'x4' sheets, therefore, I wonder if a 20% larger boat will necessitate 50% more wood purchase.

Thank you for your time.

Best regards,
