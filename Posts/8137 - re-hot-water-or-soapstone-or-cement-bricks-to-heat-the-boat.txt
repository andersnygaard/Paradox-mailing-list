Subject: Re: Hot water or soapstone or cement bricks to heat the boat

Yes, I'm well aware of the water trick to heat sleeping bags, having been a winter camping enthusiast. I understand the specific gravity of water is higher than soapstone. However, isn't there also a question of how hot you can heat the material? Cement, for example, can be heated so hot that it releases energy over a much longer period than water (I own a masonry contraflow heater). I'm no expert at this, just wondering about using soapstone (or refractory cement blocks) heated on a stove as a potential heat source. Anyone knowledgeable on this?
