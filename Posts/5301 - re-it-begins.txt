Rodney,

The epoxy thing is hard to go wrong with. It is very simple and nearly foolproof. Also, the screws and nails will do lots of the work of holding everything together. The rudder and mast and boom and yard and yuloh are good places to begin with. Even if all the epoxy were to suddenly evaporate, all the nails etc will hold everything together very well. Look at the epoxy as a waterproofer and rot stopper. It will go just fine.

I can recommend surgical rubber gloves. Get a box of 100. I hated them in the beginning. Then I realized that I really loved them. They save so much time wasted trying to get your hands clean with MEK/acetone/vinegar/whatever. They just strip off your hands 1, 2, 3 and you're ready for the next step. I have gotten to the point where I use them when painting and varnishing too.

Good luck,

Steve Yahn
