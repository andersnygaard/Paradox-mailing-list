Subject: Re: Removable back window for Paradox

I'm glad you enjoyed the webpage on our rear window setup aboard Little Cruiser. I think this arrangement works really well for the type of coastal sailing and island hopping that we do. However, if I were ever to take our boat for a serious and long ocean passage across the Atlantic or the Pacific, I might think about glueing the window shut with some 3M 5200 beforehand.

I wonder if, in Paradox, the bottom of the window would have to swing out rather than the top swing in. I could see that top edge bashing me on the back of my head if I hit an unexpected powerboat wash.

Ahh, It's not just me then. I find if I try often enough it eventually gets through.

Hoping for calm nights
