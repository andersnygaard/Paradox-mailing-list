Subject: PLAN DIMENSION QUESTIONS

Hello,

I started drawing Paradox in cad a few days ago and I have a couple questions about dimensions, bulkhead deck curves, and bulkhead openings.

Two Exhibits in .pdf are attached to help explain and illustrate.

I'm very excited to complete this drawing and am very thankful to anyone that can help me out.

Thanks.
