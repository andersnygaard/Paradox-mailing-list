Subject: Re: When is marine plywood NOT marine plywood?

Hello Jeff,

I have spent hours digging through my extensive Classic Boat and Boatman magazine collection.

I have found and article spread over two 'The Boatman' magazines (issues 24 & 25 May/June 1995) discussing what passes as marine plywood. I knew I'd read something somewhere! [:)]

I shall impart my new found knowledge when I get time to read the articles.

I have yet to see this stack of plywood, hence my keenness in knowing what to look for.

I live on the east coast 18 miles south of Scarborough in a little town called Bridlington so I live a fair distance from you and I have yet to discuss price with my friends brother yet.  He's one of these blokes that is hard to get hold of but I'll keep you in mind.

Greg
