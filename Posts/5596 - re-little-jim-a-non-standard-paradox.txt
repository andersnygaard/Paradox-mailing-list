I believe you are right. I saw a vid of David sculling and it looks to me the motion it takes to get the boat to move forward straight is back and forth. He mentions to turn u scull to either side. I don't think a curve in the flat end would make this work as well. I believe you are right and the curve is from end to end. And yes.. 30mm is prob a suggested measurement and I will bet some experimenting will improve the work involved in sculling. Depending on how difficult I find this piece to make I may construct a couple of more with diffirent degrees of curve after try out the one per plan.

Correct me if I am wrong - which I often am - but is not the curvature in the yuloh to allow the user to scull from a comfortable position without the shaft being overly long?
So each one should be specifically designed to suit the particular boat and comfortable working position of the sculler?
