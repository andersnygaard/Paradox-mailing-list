Hi all,

I just got back from the first cruise on my Paradox Odyssey.

I went from Barnegat Bay, NJ to Staten Island, NY, then through ICW in Long Island to Peconics and Gardiner Bay, Montauk Pt, to Pt. Judith, RI.
~250 n.m. in 8 days. 
I am fascinated with the boat, with every single aspect of it. It feels very safe and capable, very easy to controll, surprizingly fast, comfy and cozy. I am 6.3/225 lbs, yet there is plenty of room. I slept in the boat and have all my stuff, and 10-days worth of food and water with me. 

I started cutting wood December 3, 2009, I launched it on May 12, 2011.
I kept a log and, conservatively, I figured ~$2500 worth of raw materials (ply, wood, epoxy, fiberglass, lexan, fasteners, lead, varnish, paint etc). I used ACX plywood and selected Hem-Fir 2x4s and 2x6s from home centers. I tried several brands of epoxy and liked Polymer Products and Progressive Epoxy. 
Plus, it took ~ $1500 worth of hardware to rig it up (blocks, lines, s/s rails, hatch, anchors etc). And another $1500 for GPS, radio, solar, lights, battery, trailer etc.

For the ballast: I used 350 lbs of lead, plus 55 liters of water in the tanks and ~100 lbs of food and gear. This took it to the waterline and I think it works out very well.
Sail: I ordered a new version of sail from Sailrite. I am very pleased with it's performance. Down the road, I will probably add the window for better visibility.

Last but not least, I used a lot of help from this group. All in all, it's been an amaizing experience. 

Thank you all,
Alexander
