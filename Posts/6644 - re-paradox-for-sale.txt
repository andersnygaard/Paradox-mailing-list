First off I would like to thank everyone for the wonderful comments about Zoe. There has been a lot of interest in her, so I want to mention that she comes with a trailer and pretty much everything you see in the files section, except the little gps and the auto helm 800 - both of which I am using on my other boats.

Again, thanks everyone.

Glen
