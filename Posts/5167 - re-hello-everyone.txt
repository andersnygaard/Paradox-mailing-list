Don't make me blush.
It doesn't look that good up close!

It's my first build and I wouldn't class myself as any sort of 
craftsman.
I suppose the thing I do, is perhaps take more time over the bits 
that actually show. Believe me, there are few bodges here and there 
which will remain out of sight. Epoxy is a wonderful filler......
