Subject: Re: To Hawaii?

I will never fly commercial again... I will drive or take a boat. :)

After years of flying around the Canadian Arctic - where a 50 year old DC3 was considered "state of the art" I have pushed my luck more than a few times and vowed never again. The stories I could tell.

But if my choice was going to Hawaii in a Paradox or a commercial jet- or driving on an LA freeway during rush hour?

Well - I might have to reconsider :-)

Besides where is that sense of adventure you mention?

Flying is fine - its the landings that might get you.
