I just received my Paradox plans (thanks Dave) and have been pouring over them for the greater part of the day. I'm sure to be learning a great deal of the design as I proceed, but hopefully I can prod some of you builders for some wisdom.

I've studied Glen's rig photos with a great deal of interest. Glen's addition of a topping lift seems to make a lot of sense, and is something which I will seriously consider, and definitely allow provisions for it's addition if I don't immediately incorporate it.

I do have a question about the brass pipe spacer surrounding the tack strop. It appears that there could be the potential for the end of the pipe to (quickly?) bugger up the deck through regular use. Have any of you owners noticed this occuring? Have any ideas? 

I was wondering if perhaps a "donut" of UHMW around the end of this pipe would protect the deck from damage and still perform as necessary. The "donut" in my mind's eye would have a 1/2" or 3/4" roundover, all around. This would seem to me to be gentler on the deck which may or may not further benefit from a pad (leather, teak, UHMW?) of it's own. I guess ideally, I could see a LOOSE ball and socket arrangement, provided full range of movement and no interference with the furling line were encountered.

Then again, maybe I'm failing to see the obvious. Perhaps the pipe spacer/tack strop works perfectly?

I'm looking forward to getting started next week.
