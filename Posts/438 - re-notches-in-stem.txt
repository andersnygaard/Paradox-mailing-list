Thanks. What shape did you make the cutouts in the stem?

Hi Al,
If you will look on drawing #4 lower left hand side you will note that the shear clamps as well as the chine logs are inlet into the stem. As for the transom I notched both the forward lower and upper cleats to accept the clamp and log. Hopes this helps
