I haven't started yet or even fully decided this is the boat I will build. I'm in Clearfield County, Pennsylvania and the small lake I would mostly be using a boat in is Curwensville Lake | The Natural Choice! 

Not a real big lake but you can boat upstream for miles. Paradox is more boat than I really need (build stronger). The only waves here are from other boats.
