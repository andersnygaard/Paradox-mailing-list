Subject: Re: Andrew Graham's Zero

Thanks for those Bill. I'm interested in the forward underfloor water storage. I'm not at all happy about using the epoxy lined tanks as per the original design and was toying with using water conatiners like Andrew has done. I've found these collapsible bladders http://www.marinescene.co.uk/view/452/plastimo-flexible-water-tank-50ltr which may work quite nicely, and of course won't need to be vented. I wonder is that dumbell used for Ballast or is Andrew a keep fit fanatic?
As I haven't found myself any lead as yet, I'm always interested in other ideas for ballast. Has anyone considered using concrete or would it take up to much space (haven't done any calculations!).

Lead is ideal for the fixed ballast, as per design. It was easy to cast the 'pigs' in tins used for baking bread. Regarding the water ballast tanks. They are a real bind to make, including the vents and the fill/empty pipes. With hindsight I would have done what Andrew did. This is a more veratile arrangement, whereby other heavy articles could be placed there in addition to water in separate bottles.

Bill.
