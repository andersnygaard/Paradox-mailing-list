Thank you for the compliment. I suppose the boat will tip over as I lean over the side. I had not thought of that. It may be that I can start the shaft into the hole up to the ball valve and then open the valve. I think I may add a lanyard to save from dropping it. It won't float!

An elegant solution to the motor bracket problem. I hope it doesn't take on too much water while you are trying to fit it while afloat.

Hoping for calm nights
