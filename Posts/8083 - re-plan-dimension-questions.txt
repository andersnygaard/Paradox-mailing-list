Hello,

I find it difficult to resist being overly particular about my CAD drawings. Contradicting measurements by .0123mm drive me crazy. However, I will try my best to leave the deck beams alone and scale from the drawing when I have to, although it makes me cringe just thinking about it.

Thank you for your advice and the awesome website!

Best regards,
