Absolutely right! I just bought an 89 Hunter 140 with a brand new roller furling jib and practically new main on a galvanized trailer in great shape for $300. Just couldn't pass it up. I see trailerable cruisers all the time for less then $1000, they usually need a good cleaning and maybe some touching up work that will require a full weeks effort, but try to build something for $1000 in a week. The only reason I would build a boat is for the enjoyment of building it and or I couldn't find anything else that would fulfill my requirements.

This is so true.

Indeed, in many places, serviceable older unloved fiberglass sailboats can be acquired for nearly free.

Building a boat is very rarely the cheapest or quickest way to get a boat.
