Now, Now, there IS such a thing as a low maintenance woman.  I know because I am the high maintenance partner of my extremely low maintenance wife.  She is a serial boat buyer and about as calm and low key as they come.  My advice, stay away from anything wearing makeup and pretty clothes (because those things have nothing to do with beauty, internally or externally!).  Stick with the ladies who can watch a game and have a beer with the boys!
