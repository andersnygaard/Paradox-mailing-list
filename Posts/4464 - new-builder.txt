Hi All,

Found the paradox by accident, but loved it from first sight, Had the plans about three maybe four weeks now. Taking the time going through the plans and the archives of this group at the moment.

Starting to build in May. Not going to make any changes to the boat just going to build it as it was designed.

The only downside I can see is that I live in Australia and it seems that most of the on and off water Paradox fun happens in the USA and the UK.

Hopefully there won't be to many questions from me as most of the questions I've had I have found the answers to in the archives.

Well theres my little introduction.

Brett.
