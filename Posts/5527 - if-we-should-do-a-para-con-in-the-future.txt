Subject: If we should do a Para-con in the future 

One of the rough spots to throwing a paracon type of event for the Bahamas would of course be getting our brothers on the "other side of the Lake" (anywhere but USA) over here with their boats. In fact unless we are sponsered by Virgin I don't see the boats making it. I have an idea though.  

For me personally .. IF and a big IF (depends on when event is) my boat is ready I would have no problem working out a time-share schedule for anybody who had built a paradox but could not get their boat over. Maybe we could work out some sort of accomadation deal to get over-night or camping accomadations and then share boats. This would give a guy like me who has no experiance fine-tuning this boat some insight from the guys who have been using them. All the guys who couldn't make the sea voyage could fly in and still participate in the event. Don't know... probably just a hair-brained idea from an over-excited newbie but if there is any interest... I'm in! Heh... as long as I get at least another year on the build... LOL!
