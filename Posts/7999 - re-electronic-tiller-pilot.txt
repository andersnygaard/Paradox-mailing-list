Hi,
autopilot held course better than vane, vane followed wind shifts autopilot did not.
small solar panel could not keep up with demand of autopilot for more than a day or two at most.
I used it all the time, I hate to steer... would rather read a book while on watch.
It was able to handle any sea I was ever in... they weren't all that large.
hope this helps
Glen
