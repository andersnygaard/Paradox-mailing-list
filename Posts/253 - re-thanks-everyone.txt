Hi All;

I tend to agree with Dave on the issue of first time building, The Paradox is an ambitious project. How ever I firmly believe that a determined 1st time builder can get through it, especially, as David Beard points out, with the help of the group and past articles written on the subject. Just be prepared to give some time and thought to many steps. As an example the vent trunk is a lot of work. It took me two years of on a again, off again work to finish "Zoe" but I really threw myself into it the last three months. I'm sure I have over a thousand hours in her but she could have been completed in a lot less. A thousand hours is six months of full time (40 hrs per week) work.

To answer Orpdh's question about the chine runners I did not have Don's articles when I got to that step and I build my runners out of small pieces of fir 2x4 cut to shape and glued along the overhang. This is a good example of the complexity of the design. The chine runners are changing shape in three dimensions as the stations move aft. while not difficult they do require some thought and ingenuity. Fearing that the runners would take more then a little abuse I made mine out of solid wood vice plywood and they have ample glass covering.

The deck and cabin beams are made of 1/4" timber (easy to bend) laminated up to the proper thickness on an easily constructed mold. They are all made long and then cut to proper length on fitting. Two molds are required because the deck and cabin top have different crowns. If you make a beam a day early in the project they will be ready when you need them.
