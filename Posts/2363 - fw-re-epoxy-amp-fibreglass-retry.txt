Subject: FW: Re: Epoxy & Fibreglass - Retry

Hi all,

I have found a UK manufacturer of epoxy resins for marine use at www.epoxy-resins.co.uk. They are recommending their 450g (about 16oz) biaxial fabric for the bottom and 200g (7oz) woven fabric for the sides and deck. The roll prices seem reasonable and the epoxy resin prices are considerably better than what I have to pay for West Systems products. Once you have had a look at their site, I would appreciate any thoughts and ideas on suitability for my Paradox which will be coastal cruising and river and creek crawling before I buy.

I am aware that the specs that the company suggest just happen to be what they sell!

Re.: Glassing all over - the 'box' fibreglassed is stronger than the box unfibreglassed.

Cheers,

Derek
