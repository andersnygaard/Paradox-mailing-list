Hi Brent,

As I mentioned earlier, I didn't do this bit according to the plans but have you allowed for the huge amount of rocker in the hull? Bulkhead one sits a lot higher than bulkhead two. My floor came out level.

As for cleats, I used whatever was to hand. Where I needed two cleats and had a bit of 50mm by 25mm I split it and had 1 by 1 cleats. If I had a bit of 25mm by 40mm I split that. Are the cleat sizes critical? I hope not or I may be in trouble. Out in a yachtsmans gale and my binsides ping off. Hardly bears thinking about :0) Mind you, I must confess to not following the plans on the binsides either. I've had a couple of camper vans with those hole in a panel entries, and they are a beggar when you want to find anything. Also, why have a bin where stuff dropped in can go right on down to the bilges?

There are a few anomalies on the plans, but they aren't significant. Let the force guide you, but if you aren't happy with that, then extra epoxy, silicone, gaffer tape, brass screws, ring nails, or Don Elliot and other builders, can solve most of life's Paradoxes.

The vents and ground plate thingy I left out (see previous discussions re epoxied water tanks and blindness, and wooden masts, no metal rigging, and lightning strikes, likelihood of in UK for my reasons) but aren't they on the side of the bulkhead where the floor is fixed?

HTH .... Derek
