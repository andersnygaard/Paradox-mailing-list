Hi Andrew,

Great post! I would like to respond to the following excerpt.

"The most difficult part here was computing the new sail area (an
increase of 68%) and displacement (a 60% increase) which would put her
on her new lines (10.8") and maintain the same sail area to displacement
ratio."

My observation is that increasing the sail area to that extent is going
to end up with " a really big roll" of sail around the mast when reefed.
Not sure how practical that would work out in reality.  Seems I recall
that when Sven looked at a bigger, longer version of his "Bris" design
he changed it to a schooner rig with two reduced area sails. Getting
those two masts into a "tidy" configuration lead to him giving up on
that idea.

The other factor is regarding the plywood cutting plan with a beam of
almost 5' and  a length that would require two scarfs to get that 16'
6.42" LOA.

So one is taking a very simple design into an area that is going to take
a whole lot of fiddling and adjusting to accomplish. Not saying it can't
be done, just suggesting there is a lot more to it than multiplying
everything by a factor of 1.2 or whatever.

Both Bolger and Michalak take into consideration the innate challenge of
fitting standard 8' X 4' plywood sheets into their designs and is a
prime factor with the elegance of their plans both from an cost and
degree of work required to reach a best "bang for the buck" in the
finished product.
