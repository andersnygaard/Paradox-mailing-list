Subject: Video -Rigging up Scout in under 10min.. Trailer to water

It's one of the most endearing qualities of a micro. Literally from setting the parking brake, mast down, with the boat strapped to the trailer at the ramp....to floating at the dock sail ready in less than 10 minutes, no strain, un-rushed. The flying, furling boom and sail require no hanking on. Shove the mast in the hole...and go sailing in 25 knots. No Problem! Love it! This is unedited raw video, non-stop from beginning of process to the end.
