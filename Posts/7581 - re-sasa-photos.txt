I had considered an outside tiller, however in retrospect, I can't remember any time I would have used it.

I do have a tiller extension down below. This allows me to steer with my legs whilst they are either dangling when sat on the aft deck or whilst standing, normally when motoring.

I don't have built in water ballast but use 5x10 litre water bladders and full bottles/cans of beer.

I keep one of those bladders sterilised for emergency water, the others I fill with brine if necessary.  Drinking water is carried separately in 2L coke bottles.
