It is possible to refuel from the cabin by stretching over the aft deck, but you can't see how much petrol is in the tank.  A bulb pump would be a better solution, but again, how do you know the amount of petrol in the tank?

Al's observations about the safety harness etc are right, but I would add that a harness gets in the way and it could actually cause a problem.  Without it one is free to move.  This issue has been discussed on forums before.  My preference has been not to use a harness, except in the severest conditions. ( I would not be refuelling the engine at such a time.)  Regarding the engine running and in gear - I found that if it was ticking over and in drive the boat was more stable which made the job easier.

Engines, refuelling, safety - these are all matters of personal choice for Paradox owners.

I admit I have taken many risks and one day I may take a risk too far!!  As Steve points out, 'Faith' has been on my side, or rather shall I say, my God.  May He bless and guard you too.

Bill.
