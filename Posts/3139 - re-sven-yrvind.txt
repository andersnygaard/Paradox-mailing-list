Subject: re Sven Yrvind

Hi David,

For details of this boat, please visit www.yrvind.com. Also, take a look at files/photos/google under Yrvind, Sven Lundin (his previous name) and Bris (the name of several of his boats).

I think this design is just wonderful. Unfortunately, no plans are available. Sven states he merely supplies inspiration. He most certainly does.

Cheers,
Neil
