I think comfort is relative to what you are used to. I have no doubt in my mind that you could "fit" in a Paradox, but whether or not you would be comfortable is another thing entirely. You have to remember that this boat is quite small. To me, it's more like being in a car or a two-man tent. If at all possible, I would definitely encourage you to see the boat in person.
