Subject: Re: Paradox Max

Good luck on your build Gunther. A Paradox MAX has been dreamed of by many. I think it's a great idea and expect it to work well too. Three years ago I sat on a Wharram Tiki 46 and chatted with Matt (the designer of Paradox) about a larger Paradox. If I remember correctly, Matt thought it was a build worth doing too. I got no sense from him that a larger Paradox would be difficult, or not work, or a poor performer. I think if done right it could open up an entire new line of builders interested in a larger boat. As you may already know Matt himself even sketched larger versions of Paradox at 21 plus feet.

Take plenty of pictures!
