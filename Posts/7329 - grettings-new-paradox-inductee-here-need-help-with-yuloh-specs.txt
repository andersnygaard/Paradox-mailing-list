Subject: Grettings! New Paradox inductee here... Need help with Yuloh specs  
Date: Fri, 01 Feb 2013 17:44:48 -0000 

My name is Sean Mulligan. For most of my life I have played in the pocket cruiser world which culminated in me founding the Havasu Pocket Cruisers Convention (www.sailhavasu.com). I have always been intrigued by micro cruisers, the texas 200, watertribe events, etc. I have lurked on the micro-cruiser websites for years, drooling because I just did not have the time to build one of my own.

Well, when I saw Lezlie's "Tardis" go up for sale I got a hold of her immediately and long story short....I am now the owner of a beautifully constructed 95% complete Paradox. :-)

The boat is not even here in Havasu yet, as I have it stored at my buddy John Ownes of J.O. Woodowrks in Texas...but it should arrive here in AZ soon.

One thing I need to do is to construct the Yuloh. I was hoping that there was info in the plans or build manual...but John has preused them for me and says "no". Can anyone help out with something with specific instructions/dimensions for building a Yuloh for the Paradox? Or please point me in the right direction??

Thanks. I look forward to really getting to know the group over the coming months/years. "Tardis" will probably undergo a name change...but Lezlies legacy will go forward in the Paradox world. I am thrilled to be in the position to take custody of her Paradox and make her my own.
