Bill Nolen here: I am the new Moderator of the PDGoose Owners Web Site.

I'm trying to develop a new-up-to-date list of PDGoose Owners, and also people who are now building a Goose. If you are the owner, or are building one of these wonderful 4-foot by 12-foot square sailboats...PLEASE send me the following information:

First and Last Name
City and State
Type of Goose. (Open PDGoose, Ooze Goose, Cabin Goose, etc.)

Please send data direct to BGN5731@...

Thank you,
