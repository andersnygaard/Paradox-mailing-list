Hi Jason,

I am bout 5 inches shorter than you and I share some of your reservations.

There were two other things I have observed in the past few days as well. First was in Glen's excellent article were he tells us about having a visiter come to see his boat and they both stood out in the rain talking and got soaked as he had to keep the hatch closed and there is not really room to invite the guest aboard. Not a problem in the Florida Keyes but I live in Canada most of the time:-)

Then Andrew posted about his cruise in Zero and shared these words:

"The weather was very humid and would have made two up cruising uncomfortable."

I know this is only minor nit-picking, but nonetheless I can visualize not always wanting to sail solo and a larger boat as offering quite a few more possibilities without adding a huge amount of extra investment.

This is simply my personal observation and nothing against the desing, which cannot be improved for what it was designed to do.

Cheers, Nels
