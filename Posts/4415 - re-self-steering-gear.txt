This topic has interested me for a long time. I would like to throw 
out, to everyone, an idea I read about once. I have not tried it 
myself yet.

Anyway it is like this. To the aft side of the rudder 
axis you add a weight. It is in the form of a generaly horizontal 
shaft and a movable weight riding or sliding upon it. There is a 
lockscrew to fix it in position. This is above the waterline. You 
adjust the position of the weight on the shaft nearer to or farther 
from the rudder axis to control the amount coarse corection.

Why this works is that as the hull heels the center of forward effort 
(as viewed from above ) of the sail moves a bit to leeward of the 
center of resistance of the hull. The hull is relatively upwind of 
this and so the bow will want to round up to windward. Now what 
happens with this additional device is that the weight will fall 
down to leeward as the hull heels and input a fallingoff influence 
to the coarse and achieve a ballance!

A hundred years ago this tactic was used on model sailboats. Joshua Slocumbe saw this and 
gave him couragement to try his own ingenuity. Or so I read. This 
weight idea "FITS" with the lead weight in the trailing edge of the 
rudderblade as Matt has shown on the plans. It not only sinks the 
bouyant wood rudder but also adds auto steering too. Or so it seems 
to me.

This could be a factor when going to windward in Paradox, but some 
people lock the steering line, in which case the lead weight would 
have no effect.
