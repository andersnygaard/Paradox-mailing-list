Hello everyone, 

I am doing my best to mentally construct paradox before I begin chopping up the very expensive Douglas fir I have. I'm having a fun time trying to figure out exactly how the jigs and beams should be made. 

I've decided to use plywood cut into 25mm strips to laminate the beams from. Hopefully using 9mm fir, I won't have to steam the strips. 

I think the easiest way to build the jigs would be using the method this gentleman has: http://pi.math.cornell.edu/~noonan/boats/paradox.html. I understand this would be backwards to how I see most other people make the jigs but since the curvature of the top is written on the plans it's much easier for my brain. 

I've also read that the crown of each beam will vary along the length of the boat. Do I just make all the beams identical and then shave them down when fitting the deck to account for that difference or is there a simpler way? 

And does anyone see any flaws in this route of construction? Thank you guys in advance, it would not be possible for me to construct this vessel (at least in a reasonable length of time) without all the information you awesome people are eager to share! 

Best regards,
