Bill,

That helm seat looks interesting. Is it a solid piece of wood with routed out grooves or is it tounge and groove or similar construction? Can you post some close up pictures and perhaps give some info on construction.

Many thanks 
Pete

It's made from strips of wood laminated with epoxy, then varnished. I made it a bit wider than the designed seat to give me more support. When it is stowed as per plan, the upper edge just comes below the bulkhead opening. I made a large hand grip, like Al did with Little Jim. (Thank you Al for the idea.)

Bill.
