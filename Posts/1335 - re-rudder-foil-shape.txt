Silly me, still math never was my strong suit.

Now it makes sense. The rudder foil is 2x12 not 2x24, for a total thickness of 24. So 24/400=.06. That explains why NACA 0006 looks the closest. 

Paul

As the rudder foil is 400mm long and 2x24mm ply thick (not counting the glue) it should be possible to make a 16.66% profile. So NACA 0015 (15%) would be a reasonable shape.
