Hi John,

Thanks.

The picture of Jill Baby under sail is currently what I'm using for my desktop wallpaper. :)

Regarding 100 degree heat, you can have it all you want.  The only disadvantage of cold temps is working with epoxy.  I lose almost all my energy once it gets over about 80 or so;  I can work all day in 40 degree air.  I guess it's a case of the grass always being greener on the other side.  >B-)
