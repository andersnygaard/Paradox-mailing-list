Oarlocks (rollocks) are better for sculling The ideal sculling oar should actually curve up at the tip, to enhanse the natural twist of the sweep (oar). this is because the oar blade is naturally in the vertical position.
The yulah needs to be curved down so as you move the handle back and forth the blade twists the correct way. The ball accentuates the helpfull curve and has less friction to boot. 
Each set-up will require some getting used to and you might find you like the rope the Chinese used to help. 
Stick to it ...I'd guess the yulah is possibly best for the Paradox, because of the geometry, height of transom, stowage, hull weight seem to me to favour the yulah.
