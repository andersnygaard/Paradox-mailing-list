Thanks Dave,

I dont have an exact count on how much ballast I was carrying, but it did sit on its water line, but thats not 9 inches and she felt a bit tender, we had a few heavy plastic bags to grab sand with but we really ran out of day light and we just got to beat to wind for about 8 tacks and then went with the wind back, I felt she needed more and would preform much better. hopefully I will get her out again tomorrow and spend some time trimming her up.

I thought Little Jim felt tender, so one day when the weather was nice and I didn't mind getting wet I grabbed hold of the mast and leant out. See the result at www.asjg.clara.co.uk/little_jim under 'Stability & Balance'.

We seem to heel to about 20 degrees when she is sailing well close hauled.

Hoping for calm nights
