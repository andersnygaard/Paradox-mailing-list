Hi Al,

My way of thinking with NOLI's bottom being 3/8" is that she displaces just over 500 lbs less than PARADOX for the same size, so she might be less susceptible to hull damage being lighter.

Just make sure you and Bill are close at hand when I am proven wrong.

You'll be all right in the Solent, all that nice soft mud ....

Actually last year I saw 2 boats that had sustained sufficient damage to be taking on water. One from drying out on a stone and one from hitting a (just) submerged post. The year before I heard from a skipper where the cruise had to be abandoned and the boat beached immediately, the damage was so bad.

Hoping for calm nights
