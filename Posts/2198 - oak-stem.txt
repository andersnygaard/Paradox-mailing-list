Subject: Oak Stem

I was in Cornwall last weeek and spent some time watching  5 guys rebuilding a 200 year old fishing boat. They thought it amusing that I was boat building in the Midlands, and they gave me a piece of green Cornish (not English) Oak for the Paradox stem. It is 2 inches thick by 3 feet long and curves from 12 inches to nothing.

I was originally intending to laminate the stem from ply and finish off with an old piece of oak from a cabinet that I broke up years ago. Now I would like to cut a piece from this Cornish Oak, with its nautical antecedents, but presume that it is likely to warp as it dries out. What can I do to counteract the warping?

I don't mind using it just for the outer part of the stem if that will be the easiest course of action. 

Thanks for any advice......Derek
