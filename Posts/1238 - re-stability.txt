Ban_Anas2002,

The stability curve for the Paradox suggests that it will self right 
from 160 degrees. I know mine pops up quickly from 90 degrees, 
and standing on the rail and leaning out only pulled it over about 30 
degrees.

Mine carries 80kg water ballast, 100kg lead, anchor and heavy 
stores all under the floor.

During normal sailing most of the water that comes aboard is from 
wet feet. The only time I have had a significant amount in the bilges 
was when I was knocked down to 90 degrees and the hatch was 
open a crack. About 2 or 3 litres came aboard.

One of the cunning design features of the Paradox is that it can be 
bailed from inside without opening the hatch.

Hoping for calm nights
