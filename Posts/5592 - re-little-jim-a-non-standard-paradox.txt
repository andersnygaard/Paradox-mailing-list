Most of my wood removal was done with a hand plane or a coarse sanding disc in an angle grinder (almost as fast as a power plane, but not bothered by epoxy or the odd nail).

I bought a roll of sanding paper (1 inch wide) and found that a couple of feet of this, held at each end over the corner and the ends pulled alternately, produced a very smooth curve (and removed a surprising amount of wood). I made up cardboard templates for the various sections to see that I was somewhere near the right size.

Hoping for calm nights
