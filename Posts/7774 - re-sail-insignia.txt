I like both symbols, but I don't see how they relate to an unorthodox design, i.e. chine runners. How about something like a black swan, which until Australia was discovered was held as a scientific nonsense/impossibility.  I'm sure there are literally tens of thousands of things the mankind once held as absolute/impossible but are now debunked/factual.
