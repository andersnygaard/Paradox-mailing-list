Wipe down the hull with rags soaked in acetone and stick it in the sun. The acetone will dissolve the un-mixed chemistry and dilute it to the evaporative state if not collect it in the rag, leaving the already bonded epoxy chains behind. The sun will accelerate the cure of the remaining epoxy and allow you to go forth and conquer the project like the true master of your domain that you are.

How's that for techno-poetry with a little shade tree mechanic thrown-in for good measure?

Actually, I've made all these mistakes myself at one time or another in the years I've been doing this and at this point you have little to lose beyond your already stated future of just scraping the hull with the attendant loss of materials.
