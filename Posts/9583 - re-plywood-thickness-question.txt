Thank you guys for replies. Creditscorenz, your post makes a lot of sense. Bottom stringer idea came to me from my previous build, but it was lighter boat and you are right - you can hear them gurgling and inducing lots of drag on the way. I will not put them on my Paradox. As you say, anchoring is better but i want to be able to beach it in unexpected situations, which is doable as per plans.

Thanks for advice, it all makes sense when other people spell it out, sometimes I get stuck with my own bad ideas just because i was thinking about them too much and forgot they were probably not that good in the first place.
