unless one of you guys wants to sell me your boat, I won't be participating.

I expect mine will be up for sale later this year. It's in the UK however!

First place in the Everglades challenge in Paradox and close runner up twice in the ultimate Florida challenge in both Enigma and Elusion. The 40 mile portage in the later 2 blows my mind...
