Rain on Sunday Al? :-o
Ah well. I have to finish some drawings for a developer by Tuesday so Sunday will be my drawing day.
Take your camera with you on your trip and take plenty of pictures. Pleeeeeeze.
I'll show you mine if you show me yours.
Now where have I heard that before?
Have a fine trip.

It's looking good, Jeff. We must try to get the whole fleet sailing together this summer.

I am intending to have my first outing of the year this weekend, launching at Calshot on Friday afternoon and spending Saturday night at Oxey Lake, so the rain forecast for Sunday will probably arrive on Saturday morning.

Hoping for calm nights
