New drawing in the Gorfnik album. I think I got the cabin supports drawn right now and probably the seat and backrest support. I still need to add in the bracing either side of the leeboard hole.

18 inch sides plus the 15 inch cabin gives 33 inch headroom. Sitting here at the computer with a yardstick it looks like that should just be enough if I don't add much of a cushion to sit on.

Did you include any ventilation like Paradox has?
