I said you could do it a lot cheaper, Matt suggests exterior ply where I used marine as I don't think it is worth skimping when I want the boat to outlast me. I also had much of the timber planed to size, a mistake as it doesn't really matter what size most of the timber is (within reason). I spent:-

600 on timber
375 on ply
630 on epoxy etc. (I've got lots left)
30 on polystyrene insulation/buoyancy
170 on lexan sheet (lots of that left too)
350 on the sail
Plus bronze nails, SS screws and bolts, lots of new tools, cleats,
fairleads, inspection hatches, anchor, rope, LEDs for the lights,
lifejacket, cooker, ...........

It all adds up

The trailer was not included in the 2500

I know this question gets asked a lot but im confused.

How can such a small boat cost 2500 uk pounds to build.

Even after buying the wood and epoxy how could this boat end up costing more than 1000 pounds? baring in mind making the sail yourself?
