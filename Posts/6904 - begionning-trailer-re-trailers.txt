I found this trailer a while back and bought one for another use (hauling my riding mower). It is a decent relatively inexpensive trailer $289 for occasional use. I picked up mine at a Harbor Freight store within driving distance.

It folds and sores against my garage wall and I like it. One could add 'buddy bearings' to make them waterproof.
