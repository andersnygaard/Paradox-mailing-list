Thx guys. I'm from southern jersey so lumberman might be the way to go. However I'll be sure to check both. I havn't gotin plans yet. due to not being able to use the e-mail. However I was given a phone number, as well as a snail mail addy. So I guess all is not lost. i'm looking foward to building her. Such a sexy little boat...imo.

Sounds like Dave and Mindy must be off sailing.

So I suggest you go to the links section at this sire and join Don Elliot's group and ask him to send you a build manual. Or check at Dave and Mindy's webiste for Don's e-mail address at the "sketches" link. The manual is on CD and cost's about $20 I believe.
It has tons of information  and illustrations on it taking you through every step in the building process. It also has a very complete list of materials and tools and such detail as how to putty and glass the hull etc.
It even has a reduced scale set of plans. And complete plans to build a mini-sized folding dink! You can practice on that if you like.
