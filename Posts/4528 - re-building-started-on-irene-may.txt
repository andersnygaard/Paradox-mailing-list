Glad to see you are ready to cut wood.

If you want a piece of advice (you're getting it anyway :-) make all the bits and pieces first (mast rudder yuloh etc). This has 2 advantages. 1, It is easier to work on them while the hull is still flat and leaning against the wall rather than filling your work space. 2, When you finish the hull you will be ready to launch rather than having a finished hull sitting there unusable while you fiddle about.  

Go for it!

Hoping for calm nights
