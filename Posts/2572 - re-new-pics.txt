Very nice work Kjell. At this rate of progress you will be sailing your Paraplastic this Spring/Summer. By the way, I adjusted your latest pictures slightly in Photoshop to make them a little brighter and smaller. I have added these modified shots to your files section, and of course I have left your originals unaltered.
