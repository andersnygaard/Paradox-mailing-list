Subject: Re: Jetboil Gimbal

Besides being extremely concise and light, a Jetboil gimbal such as this could allow portability within a Paradox. While sailing, it could be aft of the control station in the galley area, but with the addition of a mount in the "main salon", it could easily be moved forward to eliminate the need to cook with one arm behind your back... so to speak. Hell, one could even place mount on deck, I suppose.
