From my understanding - A relatively short, flat bottomed, rockered hull will move easily through the water, (bdue to a low wetted surface) but not quickly. They don't even row that well as there is very little "carry" between strokes.

That is why the yuloh works well I think - because it applys a continous low amount of power at minimun effort. As would a 2 HP motor.

I like what Phil Bolger says about these types of boats. Something like - It only takes about 2 HP at half throttle to get it to it's hull speed. It will handle 10 HP but will make only about 1/2 knot more speed while dragging half the lake behind her:-)
