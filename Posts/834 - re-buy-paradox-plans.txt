Congratulations on very nearly completing your project. What an accomplishment it still seems very remarkable.
I have tried to contact Dave.  It seems he is "out of the office". 
I'll be interested in how the yuloh performs.  
Thanks again for the info...and thanks to all for clarification on how the plans and build book fit together.

Well thanks.

It is really very simple, just take it one step at a time. The  
steaming is done to bend strips of wood which are then laminated 
and glued to the bulkheads. If you used thinner strips (but more of 
them) then they would bend without steaming. I think someone 
here is laminating up strips of ply which also don't need steaming.

The motor would be hung on the transom. You only need 2hp. I am 
going to try the first season without a motor and see how I get on. 
It is supposed to be very easy to drive with the yuloh.

The sides and bottom go on very easily, though with the bottom 
you have to be quite quick as a lot of glue has to go on first, then 
just start nailing from the bows. 

You're right about the pictures of the bottom. I am using a borrowed 
digital camera and that bit of the assembly was over before I could 
borrow it again. 

The plans come from Dave Bolduc (mbolduc@triad.rr.com). look at 
his web site for more information 
(home.triad.rr.com/lcruise/paradox1.htm). Don wrote a series of 
articles on building a Paradox which lay down step by step 
instructions. Without these I wouldn't have stood a chance, with 
them it was easy. Not quick, mind you, I started cutting wood in 
August 2001, I am aiming to launch at easter or before.
