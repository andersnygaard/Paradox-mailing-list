Subject: Re: Tools list

The two lists to which I have referred are different in terms of derivation.  My list of tools was compiled while examining Don's Building Booklet.  It was not a list made by him.  That's why I claim authorship, not that I want to copyright it in any way, since I have freely made is available on the Paradox-uk.co.uk web site.

The list of Building Materials was part of a bought package, inclusive of Paradox plans. It's a good list and would be useful if we could use it at paradoxbuilders, but it may be subject to copyright.  That's why I suggested Matt or Dave would be able to clarify and perhaps sanction its use.

If Dave or Matt state there is no breach of copyright, I'll gladly upload the Materials List to the FAQ's file.
