Subject: Re: Sail position

This is interesting. My experience with lug sails has shown there's all kinds of tricks with them that don't apply to the accepted Bermudan setup and here's another one!

I was going to say that a standing lug like a Paradox has, was always likely to do better when the mast is to leeward, whereas a balanced lug is almost certainly going to do better when the mast is to windward and 

I would have thought that a straight luff and a concave luff would produce an identical result, but not so James.

I wonder how much concavity you can add without the sail's performance being degraded?  Perhaps that could be a way of solving lee helm, if that was a problem.

Cheers,

Rob.
