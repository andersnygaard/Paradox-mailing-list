Subject: Re: Scaling and modifying paradox.

I haven't seen it, but reports say that the enclosed accommodation is minute compared with Paradox. Either room for two to sit (just) or make up the bed and slide in feet first, when there may be enough headroom to turn over if your hips aren't too wide.

It does have a cockpit, of course, and no doubt a tent could be rigged.

It is probably more interesting to sail than a Paradox. Paradox is not really the boat for those who enjoy sailing on the edge. Most of the time you don't sail it, it sails itself and the skipper is just along for the ride.
