I am sorry to hear you are unable to work on Enuf for now, hope you get to feeling better.  I miss the updates. I still cannot see the new pics of Enuf, They denied me acess to the smallboat website. I guess you have to have a special handshake or maby that guy just felt like being a jurk today.  I have been tring to keep up with your progress and will begin building my paradox soon I just need to finish up a vw trike I am building so I will have the garage space.
