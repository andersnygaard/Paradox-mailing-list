Mine fits inside because I made my lighting rod foldable, it revolves down after removing a cable clamp which retains it in the up position. The only time I stow it inside is when I won't be using it for awhile because it requires a lot of jumping in and out of the boat. I did have to grind off a portion of the inside of the screw-in hatch to clear the anchor light, no big deal.

Making a transom hatch modified with pot belly seems like a good thought. Glen and Bill How did your mast work out here as far as storing the mast completely inside while trailering. Steve Yahn
