Hi all,

It has to be admitted that the seating position, when in protected mode, is not the most comfortable. I find that I want support for my back just where the cut out is in bulkhead 4. After a lot of fiddling about I have finally arrived at the solution for a comfortable seat.

I made a cut out in the seat support about 75mm (3") forward of bulkhead 4. This has no effect on the normal operation of the seat, but allows the seat to be flipped up so that it becomes a raked backrest. This makes this seating position possibly even more comfortable than the normal one.

I have added a couple of pictures in the photo section, under 'Little Jim' to explain it more clearly.

Hoping for calm nights
Al,
