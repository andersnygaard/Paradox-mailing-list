Thanks Al. I made a little wooden clamp to hold an umberella. It was a godsend in the high heat of the day. 

I also find the umbrella clamp invaluable, but it has little to do with the sun. 

Also, I see now after this trip I need to make a lock-clamp for the steering line. I also need to do something to better grip the sole hatches when I need to lift them. I have a couple of 1 inch holes in the sole that make it easy to lift.

I also need to put up a better wind indicator on top of the mast. The anchoring scheme you described to us worked nicley for me too, Al. My outboard motor trouble was just a dirty spark plug. It was a good shakedown cruise. Steve Yahn

Let's hope there are many more of them.

Hoping for calm nights
