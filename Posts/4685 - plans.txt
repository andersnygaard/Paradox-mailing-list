Hello,

I would like to see a set of the plans, are they located online somewhere? If I can find them online is there a fee to open them to study only and is there a fee to build one boat?

One question I have is has anyone added a few feet to the LOA and made it a bit wider at the same time? I am thinking around 20 feet as I am a bigger person at 6' and 225 LBS. I think if I crossed my legs I would heal over in the 15 footer.

Thank you for all the information and photos. I have very much enjoyed taking the helm sitting at my desk and dreaming of the warm water running under the keel (oh yah no keel).

Soon to build something strong, quick and cheap for a San Juan Island trip next summer.
