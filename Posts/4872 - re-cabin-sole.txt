Hi Jim.
NILO was the pet name for my late mother Nora, from her school days.

Hi Nels.
I forgot to add that on NOLI, it is 3 layers of cloth just past bulkhead No 3 and 2 layers to the transom.
This was after a conversation with Dave when he said any damage always happened forward of LITTLE CRUISERS lowest point.
I expect others will bear this out.
