Subject: Re: Scale mockup of wind genny and radar on Paradox

Lucky you, with the industrial NiCads.  Finding correct chargers can be a pain, but they are really nice to use, and they last almost forever.

I'm going to be full-timing onboard for a few years, and I really could not live happily without my electronic toys-- laptop and Internet, movies (with surround sound), music files and satellite radio, digital photography and photo editing, electronic books, ect.  So, I want to make sure I can generate ample electricity (add wind genny, plus my solar panels I already own.)

Plus the excess electricity can be put to good use.  For example, I plan on having 12V electric heaters onboard.  When the weather gets cold and nasty, and the batteries are already topped off, I'll have electric heating available to keep me warm without worrying about using all the propane (and the moisture created from heating from propane.)  As long as the weather is bad, I have a nice dry heat to keep me comfortable.

I'm also looking into building a small 12V watermaker that I can use at anchor or good weather-- throw the intake/waste hoses overboard, and enjoy "free" water provided by your current excess electricity generation.

Anyway, those are a few ideas for using all that electricity.  I agree, If you are just weekend sailing, a wind genny would be a total waste.
