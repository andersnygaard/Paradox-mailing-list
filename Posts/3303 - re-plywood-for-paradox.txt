Hi,

It would all depend on intended use, checkbook. The best would be to use the best grade you can afford, and sheathe that in a light fabric 2oz - 4 oz this is what I consider a great protection against abrasion and easy to repair. I would also beware of "cheap" epoxy, why would you want to take your expensive marine ply and use cheap epoxy on it. Green plywood sounds to me that its the pressure treated type and not to be used, as the moisture content is prob not desirable for laminating or filleting plus the chemicals. Exterior plywood is the SAME glue as marine, the difference is the veneers, and the grading of them, how much void is allowed, again intended use, this is not a huge boat, its not rocket science either. if using non marine grade fir, your going to want to sheathe it anyway to avoid checking. the amount of epoxy is not a huge factor in this very small boat, go with whats the best you can afford and get going on it. I used exterior A/C grade plywood got 2 seasons on it and no problems at all, totally satisified that shes gonna last a long time.
