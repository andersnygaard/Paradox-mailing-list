Hi Ray.

HM Marine use to import the old wooden POTTER 14's into the States in the 60's when they decided to take off a mould off from a POTTER hull. They then did a deck mould and sent back to Stan Smith in the UK a hull and deck moulding where it became the POTTER B type, while in the States it became the POTTER 14.
Stan must of liked the new upgrade as royalties were not paid to him from HM.
Stan also designed an 18 foot version of which 3 were built. As of about 4 years ago, only one remained. 
This 18 foot design looked to be a straight expansion of the 14 hull.
I will try and find some photo's I took of a couple of them.
