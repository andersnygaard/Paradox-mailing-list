Subject: Re: Sail


Talking of sails, I am just about to order mine and am puzzling over the fastenings. There is presumably a grommet at each end of the foot to fasten it to the boom, but is there any fastening to the yard? The plans appear to show the yard just sleeved into the sail but not fastened in any way. Is this how it is?
