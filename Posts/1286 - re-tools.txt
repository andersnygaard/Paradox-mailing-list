Bill, please don't be perturbed.

The reason I used so many clamps for my deckbeams is that I used much thinner laminations than is necessary. I actually had to use more clamps than shown in the deckbeam photo, on subsequent laminations. 

When you have your deck beam laminating jig, cut a few test pieces of material to different thicknesses. There is no need to steam the pieces, just use the thickness which will still bent around the jig. Try a dry fit with all of the laminates.

I won't comment on any of Elliot's ramblings or scratchings.

You will find that as you proceed, you will find the need for different quantities and qualities of tools than everyone else. I built my first boat using mostly a coping saw and a block plane. Today, I can not conceive of doing so.

As Glen said, it's best not to be intimidated by the elephant, just eat it one bite at a time. You can amass your tools in the same way.
