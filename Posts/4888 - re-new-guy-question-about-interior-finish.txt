Academic questions here:

How well does varnish adhere to epoxy?

Can cetol be applied over epoxy coating? I thought it was an oil that had to soak in.

From my understanding, "the secret" is to pre-sand the epoxy to get some tooth for best adhesion of varnish and apply the first coat thinned. Maybe I am thinking polyurethane varnish.

Very good point concerning Cetol. It may adhere best over the bare wood as would house paint.

I really see no point in applying epoxy to the inside of a boat unless it is an open boat.
