This statement amazes me. Either you are exaggerating OR the
conditions you are referring to were upwind sailing, with less than a
2 knot breeze in smooth water OR my much higher aspect Paradox sprit
rig has turned 'Mini' cantankerous! I never adjust the rig once it's
up, same as with the standing lug, but I most certainly use continuous
tiller input in anything other than what I've described above. Even in
those perfect conditions, I doubt I've gone any longer than 5 minutes
without some kind of tiller input or weight shifting.

No exaggeration. On one memorable occasion we were sailing in open sea with the wind over the port quarter. It was probably the bottom end of a force 4, if it had been any stronger a reef would have been indicated. We sailed, if not within talking distance at least within hailing distance for most of an hour.

My Paradox sails like it was on rails on most points of sail. When Matt won the Everglades Challenge he would set up an offshore tack then go to sleep. I frequently read a book while coasting, checking the course every 4 or 5 pages. Weight shifting seems to have very little effect.

This is on the sea. Once set up the boat sails at a particular angle to the wind. On lakes, where the wind direction can vary due to the topography, the boat direction will also tend to shift. In this situation rudder input is needed to keep a straight course.

I have no experience of any rig except the Mk1 and Mk2 designs in the plans. Have you tried the designed rig? You might find you have a lot more free time on your hands.

What are other peoples experiences?
