Subject: Re: Bolger as-29 paradox hybrid

Just a note...

I'm the guy who did the post on the Bolger group relating to the Jessie Cooper and maybe I should point out that after our Jessie Cooper ( which we lived on for nearly five years) we had Phil Bolger design a longer version called Loose Moose 2 ( otherwise known as the AS39)

We lost Loose Moose 2 and have been on a CAL 34 for some time but are talking with Chris Morejohn about the next Loose Moose (3) which is going to be a Hogfish Maximus. We just have to nail down a few details.

Chris was in St Martin not so long ago and we had a very interesting conversation and a chance to spend some time on his HM...What a wonderful boat!

I joined the other Paradox group looking for info on various cunning plans for roller reefing Balanced Lug sails as I'd really like the next boat to be a balanced lug schooner...Now at least I know where everybody hangs out!

All the best

Bob
