Subject: re paradox max weight and height

Hi Jim,

From memory (my sail was almost 2 years ago)I would lie on my front and reach in. A hook of some kind may help. Touring kayakers often attach a length of rope to gear stowed in the extremities of their boats, leaving the end within reach of the cockpit.

Any small cabin boat will have places which are difficult to get to. The cabin of the paradox is an uncluttered open plan rectangle with a flat floor. Maybe owners advice would be more helpful than mine, but I dont see you would have any problem.

Cheers,
Neil
