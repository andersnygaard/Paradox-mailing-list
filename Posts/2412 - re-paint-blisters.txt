Subject: Re: Paint Blisters ???

What kind of tarp was it? I have heard from an knowledgable wooden boat group that some tarps cause damage. Poly tarps are one kind. A cover should breathe, according to them.

I have heard the same about car covers. 

Perhaps the paint was not completely hardened and it got really hot under the tarp and it bubbled?
