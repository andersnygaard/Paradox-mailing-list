Hi there,

I don't recall ever seeing a confirmation for the completion of the build for Row 4 on the Paradox registry. The owner is Ronald de Hon of Amsterdam, Holland and the name of the build is RHXII. I am considering removing it from the registry. Does anyone know any information about it or have an approximate year of completion?

Best regards,
Okiebobby
