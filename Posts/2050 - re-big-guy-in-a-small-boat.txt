I have a removable rear window, this helps alot. When sailing I sit on the rear deck with my feet on the seat. close the hatch while in this position and you have a reading or chart table, be carefull of the boom !!!

  I should have some new pictures posted today, I think some of them will show this.

I'm 6'5" 180 lbs and also woder if I would fit or be comfortable in these tiny sharpies. I sure like the idea though. If I were to increase the overal size of the Maradox or Micro by 10 or 15 percent than I may have a better fit withoutout all the claustiphobia (SP?) and head bumping.
