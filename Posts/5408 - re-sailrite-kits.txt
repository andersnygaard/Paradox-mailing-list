It's all a series of trade offs isn't it?

If you look at the third sketch in the folder it illustrates the comparison of the two sail plans. Small differences but of some significance to me - the shortening of the boom being the main feature.

Two reasons - it clears the self-steering vane - but also lessens the chances of having the main sheet getting hung up on a raised motor - which I would think is important if one wants a motor. Which is essential in my area where light winds are a factor in the summer. Also less chance of the boom hitting the water when the waves get large, especially when sailing downwind and chancing a broach.

But this is all speculation.

Both Michael Storer and John Welsford prefer a higher aspect ratio in a lug sail but there are some trade-offs there too.

I am wondering if a lighter weight sail cloth would help getting a smoother "fall" of the loose sections of the higher AR portion of the sail although the 5.4 oz cloth chosen seems to be the best for heavy airs. Gathered up and secured with Velcro straps to the boom when lowered completely.

Perhaps Glenn could offer some observations as he upgraded his sail I believe? Any photos anywhere of the new sail plan stored on board?
