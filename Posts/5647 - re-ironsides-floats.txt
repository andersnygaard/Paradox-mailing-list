Congrats!!!

Sounds like she's doing everything that shes supposed to do, long periods without having 
to touch anything, one of her strong points, I have noticed that with higher winds and 
too much sail out she will want to come right around and into the wind on you, for me 
this says, reef it in a bit and off you go again!
