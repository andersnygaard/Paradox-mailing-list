Thankyou Nels!


How about a straight sided, round, flat bottomed container with a 90 degree "pouring lip" - like I use?

Standard Philadelphia cream cheese tubs work too and have lids. Plus lots of flavors these days.

Who the hell suggested paper cups? Was it Don? I never read his posts:-)

Just my personal choice of course.
