Subject: Gluing the scarph joint
Date: Sun, 25 Jul 2010 23:59:29 -0000


I've been trying to picture how to set-up the clamping/gluing of the scarph joint for the 3/4" (18mm) panels.  I have searched through old posts unsuccessfully to see how others did their set-up.

Here is what I'm considering at the moment:

1) Lay the panels in place on my concrete slab garage (w/plastic between things to prevent bonding to the slab, etc.).  I probably will butt one panel against a wall to keep it from moving.

2) Use narrow soft bolts (for easy drillout afterwards) and large washers to secure the panels in place, and act as clamps.  I'm thinking about using just two; each a couple of of inches from the outer edges of the panels; that way I wouldn't have any bolts to remove from the hull area, after cutting out the shape of the bottom panel.

3) Add weight (bricks, lead, etc) on top of and along the joint.  I'm even wondering if parking one of my vehicles wheels on top of the middle of the joint might help (or borrowing my neighboor's motorcycle instead of the overkill weight of my full size pickup)?

Okay, am I completely nuts and making too much of this?  Or have I screwed the pouch and completely set myself up for trouble?  Hoping to get feedback from those whom have done this.
