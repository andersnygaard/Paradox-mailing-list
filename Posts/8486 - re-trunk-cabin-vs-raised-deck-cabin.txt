I have thought a lot about this and had designed several unbuilt hulls that had a more Birdwatcher-like cabin. My concern is that the farther a glazed opening is from your position the less you can see out of it and the more healing and wave motion will further limit what you can see. If the ports are near just moving ones head a bit can alter the view considerably.
