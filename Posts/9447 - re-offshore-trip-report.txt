Yeah, I really noticed the racket as well. The footage you saw was after I had raised the rig - scandalized.  Prior to doing that, the boat was bouncing around all over the place, which is why I became seasick almost instantly and so, there's no video footage of what was going on. I was surprised that I managed to sleep at all being seasick, but I did. However, after I got home, it took me two days to catch up on the sleep I'd lost!

On past trips in normal (sheltered) anchorages, I don't sleep well the first night, then I sleep like a baby from then on. I find that enclosed cabin quite comfortable as it keeps draughts away. It was the draughts that got to me on the previous boat.
