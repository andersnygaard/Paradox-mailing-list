Thanks for the compliment on Zoe Craig. If you go into the files section you will find a lot of info on how to install the ground plate, details of the vent trunk, water tanks, ect. I have built and installed the new sail and pictures of it can be seen in the photo section in the Zoe file, the first pictures were taken with the original sail plan and my ensign is flying from the leech of the sail. The new sail is the one in the last group and doesn't have the ensign attached yet. Also I have just uploaded a drawing of the new sail plan superimposed over the old and it is in the files section in the New Sail Plan folder with a copy of Matt's posting on his thoughts about the new sail.
