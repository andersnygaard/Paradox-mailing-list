Subject: Began my build

With plans and build manual in hand, I started to lay out  the bulkheads today.  I know it is quite an undertaking, but I'm ready for the task.

I am a novice builder, and I welcome any and all advice from those of you that have built a Paradox.  As I make progress, I will post messages and upload pictures.

Wish me luck!

Lezlie
