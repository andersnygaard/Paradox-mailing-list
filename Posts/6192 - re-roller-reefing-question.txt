Thanks John!

OK, I found Dave &amp; Mindy's YouTube demonstrations of Enigma's reefing. Seeing the furler in use really helped clarify what's going on. I also see that Matt kept the design pretty much the same from Paradox to Enigma, so he must have been pretty happy with the system. Sorry if I've been a pest.

Thanks again,
Kellan
