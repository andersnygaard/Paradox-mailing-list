As a comparison, Paradox plans call for a 3/4" ply bottom plus 3 layers of 24oz glass for a total hull bottom thickness of about 1".

Three reasons:

1. Ballast - The heavy bottom adds to self-righting ability even without the internal ballast.
2. Stiffness - without having to add stiffening structure inside - in order to prevent "oil canning."
3. Safety.
