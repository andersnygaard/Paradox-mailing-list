Al,
I totally agree with your sentence....
"With someone like Matt, if the design feature looks a bit complicated there is probably a very good reason."
Except, I would remove "probably". The English are so wonderfully "reserved".

Why would "you removed the tack strop entirely" except to remove the rig from the boat?  
I assume you are saying releasing the entire assembly from the deck? by accident?

The English language is so difficult for me, even though, it is my "only" language.

must agree. johninbastrop, Texas, USA

No. If the sail is reefed, with the halyard and reefing line tight,  
and you remove the support from the strut there is nothing stopping  
the boom dropping to the deck. If you removed the tack strop entirely  
and rotate the boom the sail will wind on to the boom and the reefing  
line will wind off the drum causing the boom to rise up the mast as  
high as you like. Let it go and gravity will cause the sail to  
unroll, the reefing line to roll up and the boom to descend till it  
hits the deck.

The latest design, as drawn in the plans, prevents all this happening  
by providing support through the strut.

It is very important to understand why a design is the way it is and  
how it works before trying to "improve" it. I didn't fully understand  
when I made my simplification and it just didn't work. With someone  
like Matt, if the design feature looks a bit complicated there is  
probably a very good reason.

Hoping for calm nights

Al,
Yeovil, England.
