Hello everyone,

I am slowly finishing the fiberglass work on my paradox and approaching the point when I will need to apply finishing and protective coats to all sorts of surfaces. Please, share your experience in surface prep, materials and techniques that you've used for:

1. interior;
2. sides and deck (non-skid?);
3. bottom paint;
4. mast, boom, etc.

Thanks,
Alexander
