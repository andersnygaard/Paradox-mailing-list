Hello,

In my experience, chine runners do not have a great effect when the boat is sailed flat in light winds, granted. But as soon as you lean that boat seriously, those chine runners really dig in and act as a long keel right underneath the boat. They make a WORLD of difference then! Yes the boat will sail without the chine runners, but it won’t point nearly as high. Believe in the design! The harder I sail the boat, the more I believe. Especially when the rail rides just at the water's surface. Incredible performance when you push it hard.

Cheers from Canada.
