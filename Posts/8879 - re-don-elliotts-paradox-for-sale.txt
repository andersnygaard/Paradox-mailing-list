Subject: Re: Don Elliott's Paradox for Sale

Okay, I've got the details for Don's Paradox.  Overall it is in sound shape I'm told, but there are a few spots like the starboard toe rail and the rudder that need some minor attention. I think a fresh coat of paint both inside and out would do wonders to make her look new again. The asking price is $2800 OBO including a trailer and some cruising gear like anchors.
