Subject: Re: Epoxy & Fibreglass

Thanks for the help Dave but I am England based.
My ply is Far Eastern in origin (exterior grade).
I am expecting to deliberately ground the boat so the bottom is one area where I won't be skimping. I'll try to locate Kevlar here. I take it that it goes on over the fibreglass?
Assuming that the outer layers of my ply aren't fir is checking then still going to be a problem? Or, can I use a really light weight fibreglass on the topsides and thus use less epoxy?
Cheers......Derek
