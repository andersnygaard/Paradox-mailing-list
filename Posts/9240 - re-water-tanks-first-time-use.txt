I suggest you check that the inspection hatches aren't leaking. I had 
to replace mine 3 times before I got ones that were watertight.

Water Tanks that Leak

Last weekend while preparing my paradox out for a sail I discovered
something I missed the prior weekend. It happened when I was showing
someone the boat and showed them everything. After filling the water
tanks, I proceeded to show the dry storage areas under the floor, and
that was when I noticed it was not dry storage anymore. Was the water
coming in from the lake or the water tanks? 

My plan is to let the boat dry out while on the trailer, and then
fill the starboard tank and observe all areas for water. If there is
water outside the tank, find the leak. I am hoping it is a breach
where the pipe enters the tank where the filler tube is connected. It
may be the hose clamp is bad, or the hose has deteriorated.

I will perform that same test on the port tank. The worst case
scenario is that the 4 inch deck plates will be replaced with larger
ones so I can epoxy seal the tanks.

Pros - Water tanks are easy to fill from garden hose and a
centrifugal pump removes 85 percent of water from the tanks -
minutes.

Cons -  If they leak your dry as a bone boat is now a wet ride.
