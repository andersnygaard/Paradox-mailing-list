Dear all,

I finally had the chance to check out the new(ish) site, and I just wanted to take the opportunity to thank the guys who carried out the move. This is a great resource, filled with an awesome amount of guidance, data, and a boat load of photos. We are forever in your debt.

Regards,
Egan

P.S.
Alastair, could you please let me know if Little Jim will be at any shows this year? It was such a disappointment that we missed Beale Park last year.
