You may well be right, but 30mm curve (the way I did it) just moves the handle forward and down 30mm, not a lot of change. On the other hand, part of the reason I moved the pivot point was to prevent the handle bashing me in the face on the pull stroke.

That sounds like a reasonable reason;-)

30mm curve? Hmm that is what our "normal" lumber often has!
