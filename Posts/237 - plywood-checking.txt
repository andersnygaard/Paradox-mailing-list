Hello,

I am a new member to this group and have been catching up on all the old messages. There was a string a while ago regarding the advisability of gluing foam directly onto epoxy coated fir plywood. You wrote that, in your experience, this practice could lead to rot in the plywood due to surface checking which would then allow moisture to seep into the wood. I believe you said that a layer of fiberglass cloth will prevent the checking. I've read this same advice in many other places. But I've also read that fir plywood can check even with a layer of epoxy and glass. 

One thing that still isn't clear to me however is if there are any types of plywood that won't check with or without the fiberglass coating. I finished building a Bolger Junebug about a year and a half ago and I used1/4" "Superply" plywood. The boat isn't coated with fiberglass or epoxy, only a topcoat of Interlux Brightsides enamel and is stored in my garage. The plywood is starting to check badly. I'm starting to get the itch to build another boat but I want to maintain a better finish this time.

If you were going to build a small plywood boat and were not overly concerned with cost, what type of plywood and coating would you use if you wanted a very durable and attractive finish? I think you used Fir plywood on your very lovely "Zoe", are you concerned about the possibility of checking?

Thanks for your consideration of these questions.

Mike
