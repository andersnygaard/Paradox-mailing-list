Hi Mark,

Is this in L.A., as in, The City of...

Or, is this in L.A., as in the general area of L.A. County and its environs?

I grew-up in Redondo Beach and would like to see your boat(s) the next time I'm in town to visit friends.

Feel free to write me off-list if you like.

You might want to add my name to your list. I would be interested in corresponding with any other Paradox builders owners in the Los Angeles, California area. Incidentally, I also completed a Selway-Fisher 50/50 sailing canoe so we appear to share the same taste.

Details of my Paradox are as follows:

She is 90% complete.
No name as of yet.
Follows plans exactly.
Being built in Los Angeles, CA.

I will be sure to send photos in due course. I estimate completion by this summer.
