Great minds think alike Al.

Yes, I meant to say "taper of boom" not "taper of sail"

After fitting my own boom I modified it with a length of rigid foam 
at the clew end attached with double sided tape as I had not put 
enough taper on the boom originally.

You could also control the luff position of the sail during 
reefing by
the taper of the boom.
The bigger the diameter of the outboard end of the boom the further 
away
from the roller drum the sail will be when reefed. Fine tuned with 
a
plane or spokeshave. To add material one could try self adhesive 
draught
excluder by wrapping it locally around the boom. This could also be 
used
to get rid of bagging or creases that won't go away when reefing I 
have
thought that it would be possible to make a boom out of 3 or 4 
lengths
of 1" plastic water pipe using plywood spacers to control the booms
shape. Weigh about the same as a wooden boom but look bloody 
orible! But
not so much if the sail was fitted with sleeves.
