Agreed,

I thought about lowering the floor, but that will cut back water stores. Definitely want the mast to go "over" the head for obvious reasons. Storing the mast inside the boat is big. It looks like too much bother to get anything out of it. The stretched version is probably the sweet spot. Looking at the roof over the forward stateroom, bracing would have to be changed. It's probably doable, just afraid I'll get stuck in the "FS". Going to the forward compartment would be good to be able to look around while not at the controls. Perhaps just going past the mast, is there a problem with just coming forward past the mast? Vent problems? It looks like it may induce the stiff neck, definitely would lose some view. As I am only looking at this, like other boats, there isn't a free lunch, here it's been eaten already. It might be easier to hire a midget deckhand.
