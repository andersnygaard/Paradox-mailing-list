However there was a large quantity of green water passing right over the cabin. I decided then that storage on the foredeck (fuel, outboard etc) was not on. In those conditions it would either  be washed off or would be inoperable afterwards.

It may be that you never sail close to those sort of conditions (on the south coast of the UK they are common) but if you are relying on your electricity supply for safety functions I would be tempted to test the installation with a fire hose before setting off.

Live the dream, don't die for it.
