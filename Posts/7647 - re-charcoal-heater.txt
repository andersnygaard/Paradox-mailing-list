Subject: Re: Charcoal Heater

I just added some more pictures to Jim's charcoal heater folder with my first test build of my version of the heater. This one was just a test to see how it would work and was not meant to actually be used in a boat.

I made it out of some scrap aluminum flashing and taped it together using aluminum duct tape.

After a quick test burn (no pictures of the burn...sorry) the tape's glue and paint burned off but it did seem to work and threw off some heat. In a small area, I expect it would help heat the area a little. Enough to take the chill off anyway.

I only used a couple vaseline soaked cotton balls to get it started and some softwood square scraps of wood and some twigs. It took pretty constant feeding to keep it burning with this fuel. I expect that charcoal would have burnt with less smoke and a little longer burn time but I didn't try it.

This test proved to me that the design would probably work for what it was designed for. A tiny solid fuel heater for a small boat. I also didn't have the flexible pipe chimney so I figure it would have drawn better with a longer chimney and doors of some kind. My aluminum tape top door was the first to fall off as it burned.

As Jim stated somewhere on this forum, it might be nicer if it was a little bigger to hold more fuel but for the small size of this 2" diameter X 5" high heater, it appeared to work good enough for some quick heat without taking up much space at all and it should be easy enough to store when not needed.
