Al, 

I think hes talking about the chinerunners and the radius from the bottom, as the chinerunner profile shows.

I'm not sure if I am understanding you correctly. The bottom has a single curvature fore and aft and is flat across the way. How thick is your steel that it won't bend to the same curve as 18mm ply? If it won't bend, aren't you going to have some big holes at the chines?

Confused.

Hoping for calm nights,
