Subject: Re: Topping lift question

Yes, the topping lift is slackened off once the required sail size is set.

Having said that, If I know I am going to want to reef soon I sometimes leave the topping lift set tight. One occasion when this happened was when sailing up a winding channel, with the wind generally behind me. I knew that at some point I must stop so as I got nearer where I thought that point was I slowed down by reducing sail, and again at the next corner .... Once it got small enough I was able to do this with the sail still pulling.
