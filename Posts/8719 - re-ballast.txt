There are a few issues for my regular Paradox sail:

1. Often when I roll some of it up for reefing in stronger winds it unfortunately doesn't roll up on the boom evenly, but with creases at luff and leach, which ruins the sail shape and increases local stress.

That doesn't sound too good. I suppose the creases occur because the sail has more draft in the center than at the luff and leach. I realise that you don't want to recut your sail, but perhaps if building a test sail from polytarp you could experiment by adding more hollow to the luff and leach. That might cure it.

2. When sailing on Port tack for a long time with a reefed sail it chafes against the mast enough to make a few tiny holes after a time.

I definitely don't like the sound of that! Again, I'm wondering whether more hollow to the luff might be the answer. Then you would only have the tack of the sail chafing no matter how deeply reefed you were. You could reinforce the tack with extra material knowing that the rest of the luff won't be chafed.

Best,

Jim
