Even at the theoretical 2400 pounds displacement, the Paradox Max isn't a particularly heavy boat. If I wasn't concerned about draft, I would be looking at something like Welsford's Swaggie, which is about the same length, but has 2200 pounds of ballast, a displacement of 3850 pounds, and a draft of 32".
