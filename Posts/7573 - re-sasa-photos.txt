I'm looking at your build (and others) before deciding whether to build a Paradox myself.

You're putting the tiller above the after deck instead of through the transom. So you won't need the hole in the transom. I see your transom has no holes, neither for the tiller nor for the spars.
So why have you installed the bendy-scoopy-water-drainy thing inside the transom?

I'm impressed that you have built a curved transom: could you give us more details on how you did that?
