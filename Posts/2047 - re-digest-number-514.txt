How about building a cardboard mock-up of the cockpit & living area, and "sailing" it in your livingroom?

Just for kicks, I built a cardboard pdracer and did the same to see how I liked the size before deciding on the airboxes. Kids loved it, they played in there for about a week before it was completely destroyed. You can get boxes for free from Walmart in the middle of the night from the stockers. Then glue them together to make big sheets.
