Subject: Re: Gorfnik #2 build started

Hi Brian,

One of the most important costs when building a boat is the trailer. One of the things I liked when I first considered building Gorfnik was the fact that I could transport it with my existing standard trailer or with a pickup truck. It’s small size also opens up the opportunity to carry two of them (yes, might build a second one) on the same flatbed trailer. That cuts transport fees in half when sailing with a friend. Where do you hail from?
