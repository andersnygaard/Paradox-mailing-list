I have not built one, but have looked in to building the larger version. 
I just thought you'd like to see Svend's, as it was based on an enlarge Paradox. 
It can also be good for getting ideas for changes to a Paradox style boat. 
And you need to remember that the one Svend is building needs all the lockers for storage, as he 
is building it for a real long trip. The overall it is I think close to an enlarged Paradox.

Some of the links from this site may help if you have not seen them.

Thanks for the reply Mike

I will basically be sailing with my wife and thus Svends project will be a bit on the tight side. The reason why I like the paradox is because it is compact, enough space for 2 to sail and sleep, no keel that can get in the way when one is exploring estuaries, rivers, and dams. But it can still take some pounding at sea, where I will do most of my sailing. I will be able to launch and sail on my own if needed and with no halyards, I can raise the main by myself. All in all this is the best option for my currently.

I would like to know from you who have build a Paradox the following:

1. Completion time (would like to get on the water before I am grey)
2. Basic Material needs (work in the charity industry, so budget is important)
3. Will it be able to occasionally cruise/race in the Wednesday round the can races? (phrf rating, handicap rating for paradox?)
4. If there is a picture of two people stretched out on the floor of the cabin

Thanks for all the help to date
