I have a similar story. On summer, I was 18, I got a job in a machine shop. I was told after my first day on the job that tomarrow I would be doing "DEBURRING". I thought to myself this must be a process invented by some old French inventer by the name DE Burr. Later I learned that to deburr is really just removing the sharp little knife edges thrown up on the metal workpieces by drill or milling etc. To remove the burrs. Steve Yahn

About a week ago when I received the plans, I was quickly confused by space nails. I found the translation to bronze nails to my language but space nails, I found no reference!

I looked at catalogs, old type of nails, maybe the name of these nails changed after Matt made the plans and I think I was not far from doing a search on the NASA site... when I realized "space nails" only means about separating the nails, not some spacecraft nails. 

Possibly not extreme like this but do you have other stories about obvious things you realized during construction or the understanding of plans?

Thank you
