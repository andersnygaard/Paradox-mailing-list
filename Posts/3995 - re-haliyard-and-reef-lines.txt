Al,
I'm doing the same, but I still hope to have an easy system for dispensing water - probably from the starboard side locker forward of bulkhead 2.  I'll expect I'll have a plastic water container fitted in the side storage bin.

That's quite a good idea, that space isn't much use for anything else. You might need to watch the trim and have something heavy to move up there as you use the water, with it being so far forward.

Hoping for calm nights

Thanks Al.  How much do you have to keep an eye on trim?  I thought Paradox was a heavy boat, and provided the main ballast was in the correct places, a little here, or a little there, wouldn't make a lot of difference, but you have the experience and I appreciate your input.

Bill.
