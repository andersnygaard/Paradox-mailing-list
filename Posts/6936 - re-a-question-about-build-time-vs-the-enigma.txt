Subject: Re: A question about build time vs the Enigma.

I wonder if Matt could be presuaded to draw up the plans for stitch and glue construction?  I think that would reduce the build time but there is always that debate that S&amp;G isnt as strong as chine log construction.  In S&amp;G the basic hull shape could be built very quickly and maybe that would be your motivation to keep going once you get to all the tedious small parts!
