You cannot even trust marine plywood any more in the USA as standards have been lowered since 2000.

April 3, 2000 - Waiting for wood delivery for weekend.


April 8, 2000 - I can't believe how bad wood has gotten. Unbelievable. The AA grade Marine plywood they sent me is filled with voids and plugs and putty. One sheet has 12 fills. I complained and they said look around, that is what is available. So I did... and found that he is close to right. His stock was probably the left overs in the stack... but industry standards now allow up to 20!!!! fill plugs per side. Amazing... and each sheet is about $45. The 3/8 inch ply is proving so tough to get that I will keep his stuff... sigh. The half inch only goes on the bottom and will be covered with fiberglass fabric... so the fill plugs shouldn't be a big deal.. .. I am not sure though.
Many plans now allow for the use of exterior A-C grade plywood as it too has the same standards now, except it comes uncoated. In some ways this is an advantage as you can more easily see where the plugs are voids are.

Glen-L recommends encapsulating all wood with epoxy anyway http://glen-l.com/ lots of FREE info under Boatbuilding Resources in the left column.
