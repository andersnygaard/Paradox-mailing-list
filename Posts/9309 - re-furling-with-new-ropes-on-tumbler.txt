I don't think I could last more than a week in a Paradox and that would include getting out for daily walks. I know when I go on holiday it takes me about three days to unwind. Perhaps once you're in the zone, it all becomes normal and you don't notice it? I certainly enjoy getting out of the weather in the cabin after being on a long walk along the shore of where ever I'm sailing. It's just the hassle of moving stuff around, particularly bedding, that gets a bit tedious.

Then plan a very long trip perhaps?

I have an offer of a motor home following me on land and so, hop to the next port, rest, then hop to the next safe haven and so on. So I'm not a year aboard that tiny space.

As it happens, I think I probably would have been sailing when you wrote this, but a bit too busy to be looking at my phone!

Hope somewhere around the world someone is reading this from the cabin of a paradox.
