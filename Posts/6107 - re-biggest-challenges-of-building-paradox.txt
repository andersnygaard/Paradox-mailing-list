Subject: Re: Biggest challenges of building Paradox

Cathy,
That's geographically closer than any other builder I know!  My first build and main love is a Core Sound 20 (B&amp;B Yacht Designs), to which I added a cabin last winter.  I also have a Piccup pram and recently completed a Birder 2 (two person kayak--another B&amp;B).  Having said that, I remain a rank amateur.  I do most of my posting at messing-about.com.

Cathy, keep in mind that Jim Michalak, though an experienced
designer, has little experience with the type of open water
cruising that Paradox is designed for.  He is quite frank about
this in his account of designing Robbsboat.  As for worrying
about mistakes, that's what epoxy is for!  My own build (not a
Paradox) is structurally sound and pretty good-looking -- thanks
more to epoxy than any skills I have.  I am in Brockton, by the
way; where abouts are you located?

Cathy
PS: I'm in Canton, just a bit northwest. What are you building?
