I shall be using the 'ball joint' as per plan.  The oar lock (in the UK 'rollock') is used for sculling, just as Matt does in the video clip.  The action of yulohing is different and the ball joint helps that action.  I tried using Al's yuloh at the Beale Boat show and I made a hopeless attempt at it, the reason being that I know how to scull and do it instinctively, just like a swimmer never forgets how to swim.  I'll just have to learn the technique of yulohing.

> The yuloh plan is on Sheet #12, on the right-hand side. Don't make the same mistake I did by not putting a curve into the shaft.  The drawing shows a 30mm longitudinal concave curve, but the but Sheet #3 measures 50mm.  I'm inclined to go for the larger curve, because the yuloh will fit the deck better and it should be higher gear for when in use.
