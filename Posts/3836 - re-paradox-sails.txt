You could also control the luff position of the sail during reefing by the taper of the boom.
The bigger the diameter of the outboard end of the boom the further away from the roller drum the sail will be when reefed. Fine tuned with a plane or spokeshave.
To add material one could try self adhesive draught excluder by wrapping it locally around the boom. This could also be used to get rid of bagging or creases that won't go away when reefing
I have thought that it would be possible to make a boom out of 3 or 4 lengths of 1" plastic water pipe using plywood spacers to control the booms shape. 
Weigh about the same as a wooden boom but look bloody orible! But not so much if the sail was fitted with sleeves.

The way the sail rolls onto the drum is dependent on the taper of the sail and the angle at the tack. The Mk 1 sail has a tack angle of nearly 90 degrees so it furls pretty much on top of itself. The Mk 2 has an angle greater than 90 degrees so wants to move forward on the boom as it rolls up.

I don't think that trying to control the sail with some sort of fence would work, it would just jamb up. As Derek found, you can't fight it, you have to position the sail on the boom so that it has room to do what it wants, that way you don't get any arguments from it.

As for the line falling off the drum, this system differs from a simple headsail furling gear in that the furling line is never left slack. In 3 seasons use I have never had even a suggestion that the line wants to come off the drum. On the other hand, the topping lift (the only bit of my rig *I* designed) does quite often foul up.
