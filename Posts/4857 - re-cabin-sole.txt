Hi James.

I used 1/4" Gaboon Ply for NOLI for the sides and 3/8" for the bottom.
The 1/4" ply weighs only 16 lbs. This one of the reasons to use Marine grade over exterior ply.
Before I glassed her all over NOLI, 3 layers on the bottom, I could quite easily lift her by the bow or stern with one hand, now it take's 2.
By the way. A VW Golf can take 220 lbs on its (VW)roof rack.
As they always understate these figures, NOLI empty should be able to be roof racked  :-o
I will stick with a trailer any day.
