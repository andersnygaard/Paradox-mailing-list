On our way back home after this year's Bahamas trip, Mindy and I got to spend a few days visiting Glen and his wife. We had a great time swapping cruising stories, exchanging building ideas and simply enjoying each other's company. ZOE of course is just as beautiful as in the posted pictures, and Glen got to finally see Little Cruiser in person. (see attached photo). Hopefully, someday we'll get to go cruising together...
