Subject: Re: Plans/manual for sale?

Too bad something could not be arranged to have the plans offered as a "Package" along with Mr. Elliot's CD building manual. Then perhaps a royalty cheque could be issued to Matt and the Elliot family maybe once or twice a year.

A further option would be to have it sold through Duckworks, taking the stress off Dave and Mindy who are often out sailing anyway. http://www.duckworksbbs.com/plans.htm

Seems to me Duckworks only charges about a 12% distribution fee, base on my experience with Michalak plans. The advantage to me is that folks interested in the design would get them quicker and more reliably. I feel some folks get discouraged by the hassle of trying to obtain plans.

Just a thought.
