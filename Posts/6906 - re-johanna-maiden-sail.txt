My trailer is just a bog standard roller coaster powerboat trailer. This is the one I bought: http://www.degraafftrailers.co.uk/swing-beam-Boat-Trailer-SB700-2ADJ.html

What I had to do was tie together (using steel studding and tube) the pairs of adjacent pairs of rollers so that they all rotate as one unit regardless of where the boat is on the trailer. I've also added a couple of extra rollers on the rear pair of rollers so that the boat easily aligns. You can see the front ones tied together here http://paradoxbuild.webs.com/P6110040.jpg The rear are similar but with an extra roller in the centre. 

I've had her on and off the trailer 3 times now without any difficulty. Last weekend at Ridge wharf I didn't even dip the hubs and she loaded and unloaded single-handed using just the winch. Over the winter I'll get some proper full width supports welded up to accommodate 4 pairs of rollers up front and 6 pairs on the rear arms. Hope that makes sense.
