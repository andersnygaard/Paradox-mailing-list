I just use lots of turns of the reefing line on the drum to increase the diameter and it works ok. I like the idea of the wood donut better because the tack lashing holes could be drilled through the donut instead of the boom. Andrew Graham

I'm thinking about something I read somewhere about the spool on the 
front of the boom. To make the furling action work better there is the 
suggestion to build-up the diameter above that of the boom itself. This 
will result in less line tension needed to roll up the sail. But just 
how to build it up is what I'd like to learn from you guys with 
finished boats. A wooden doughnut, split in half and then glued or 
screwed on, is what i'm looking at. It has lots of fiberglass right now 
for strength. There must be some way to do what Matt does, and thats 
the way I want to go too. Steve Yahn
