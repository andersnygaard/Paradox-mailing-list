I'm going to paint the whole boat white, inside and out to make it as light as possible, although I suppose not too much inside painting will be necessary since most of it will be covered with insulation.

My plan was to mount permanently wired LED's to the forward face of bulkhead's 1 & 2 and to the aft face of bulkhead 4 and have them all separately switched from the switchboard. There will be another LED mounted on the underside of the cabin hatch. Permanent lighting will be a treat after the last boat where I had to use a torch for everything.

Still not sure about the need for a light on the front of bulkhead 1. Will I go in there often enough to justify having it illuminated?  I can see the sense in storing your pillow up there, James. It should stay nice and dry and you don't want weight in the bow of the boat. The forepeak could be the equivalent of a blanket box in a caravan, which would also serve to further dampen any bow slapping.
