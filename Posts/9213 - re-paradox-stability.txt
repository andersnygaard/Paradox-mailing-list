Nick,
Thanks for sharing your experience. I'm glad to know that you weathered the experience with only minor injuries and loss of possessions. It's good to know that a properly ballasted Paradox can take care of itself.

If I understand your description, you broached when going over a reef, then were carried sideways either on your side or your deck for 5-10 seconds before the wave passed you by, and then you rolled back up. 

Do you think the square chine and/or chine runner of a Paradox makes it more apt to trip when hit by a wave from the side?

You said that you were knocked down far enough for the sail to be in the water. When you were being pushed sideways did the sail just sort of skim the surface of the water? I would think that if the sail had gone very far beneath the surface it would have filled with water, acting like a parachute, and rolled you clear over? Maybe the buoyant mast kept the sail from filling, and prevented you from rolling over?

However, if you did come close to inverting, then Paradox's quick righting would be even more impressive.

A.S.
