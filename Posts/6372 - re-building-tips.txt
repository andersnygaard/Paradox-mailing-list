AHHHH Okay.. I was imagining the Chinese Yuloh I saw in SE Asia and they are not on a pin. They simply rest in a notch of the transom. I think at very least someone could put a leash on it so that if it falls over it can be hauled in.

When I first started using the yuloh it would often jump off the pin. 

To reduce this I fitted an arrangement on the principal of that 

described by Dave on Little Cruiser.



I fixed a loop of bungee around the shaft just below the pivot. A 

line was fixed to this which went down the transom to a fairlead then 

back up onto the deck where it could be fixed to a cleat. Tightening 

this line holds the yuloh onto the pin.



The inboard end of the line is permanently fastened on deck and the 

line is long enough that the yuloh may be correctly stowed on deck. 

The yuloh is, therefore, always attached to the boat.



I have, I think, 3 times lost the yuloh overboard so am very glad I 

adopted this system. 



The line is attached to the bungee with a small snap hook so the 

yuloh can easily be removed for travelling.



Your idea of using the seat as a paddle is inspired, another backup 

in case of catastrophe.
