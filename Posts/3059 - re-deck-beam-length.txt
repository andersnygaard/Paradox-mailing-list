Subject: Re: Deck Beam Length

I made all mine the same length and I'm pretty certain that I cut from across a sheet of ply; so all four foot. I then cut them to length as I fitted them. The widest bit of the boat is across bulkhead three, I think, and there isn't a beam there.

That's reassuring - I've cut mine from a sheet of plywood too.  I'm ready to apply epoxy to the first deck beam.  Probably do that tomorrow.

I couldn't finish it today, because I took a chap out to test sail my Virgo Voyager, with a view to buying her.

Bill.
