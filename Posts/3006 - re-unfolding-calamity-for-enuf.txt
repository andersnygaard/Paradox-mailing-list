Hey Derek,

Sit down in the most comfy chair you own, pour yourself a G&amp;T and watch something inane on the Telly... like a Blair speech. There's no reason to panic.

Wheel the boat out from the shop and get the sun on the upturned hull for the entire day. The purpose is to let the solar energy heat the surface of the hull and do a nice post-cure on the epoxy until it sets completely. You can help the heat build-up with a wrapping of black plastic sheeting as you would find at the local home center. This is the roll of stuff that is sold to kill all the weeds in your garden. The black absorbs the optimal heat from the sun and contains in under the plastic where it further heats the hull.

Most commercial boatbuilding epoxies can nicely do with a post cure of 200 degrees F for about 2 hours, so don't worry a lot about the excess heat issue.

You can check the progress simply by lifting the plastic at intervals and attempting to push your fingernail or a screwdriver tip into the surface. If it meets substantial resistance uniformly around the hull surface, you are in there and can remove the plastic and put that bad boy back in the shop for another day of aggravation.

The epoxy could have become contaminated in some fashion or it wasn't mixed sufficiently or it has come from a new batch that has bad chemistry in the can. The boy is alright, even if he did mix the stuff incorrectly. It's something that happens to all of us at some point in our goofy adventure building these things. Tell him he's in good company and take him to lunch. Check the epoxy mix ratio and quality by doing a small batch on something that is scrap and see how it turns out.
