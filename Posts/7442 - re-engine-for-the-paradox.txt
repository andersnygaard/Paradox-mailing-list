Subject: Re: Engine for the Paradox

Could we not ballast the Paradox with deep cycle batteries instead of just lead, then install a solar panel on the foredeck to charge the batteries?

With a couple of hundred kilograms of batteries (how much lead are you all carrying?), the trolling motor would have quite a range, and then the batteries could be charged by the solar panel in between uses.

This would be much simpler than carrying petrol and running a petrol engine to turn a generator to charge the batteries to run an electric motor...  :-)  (and all the maintenance of each of those parts.)
