Thank you Bill, I suspected as much, but I'm a plans guy only at this time, so actual info is much appreciated at this stage of the project. A simple rope step that allows easier access to the rudder step is a great idea, fitting well within my interpretation of the philosophy underlying the Paradox concept.

After falling off the foredeck into the water I had to use the rudder step in earnest! I had forgotten to wear my buoyancy aid and I was wearing 2 sweaters and an anorak - that's no so bad when you are in the water, although swimming becomes difficult, but when you try lifting yourself on the rudder step you find your knee is almost level with your head as you reach for the top of the rudder stock. A great effort is required to lift your own weight plus the weight of the water absorbed into the sweaters and anorak. I could just do it.

Without the step, getting back into Paradox would be more tricky. A loop of rope that could be dropped below the step would make the job much easier.

Bill.
