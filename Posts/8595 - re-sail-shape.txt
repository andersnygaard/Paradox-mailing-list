5mm wall thickness would be too heavy, Nick. Mine is 50 x 1.5mm and is plenty strong enough. The stiffness is about right too. When you fully hoist the sail it takes a slight curve, which increases a little when the wind blows harder.....

I think that mine is 6262 or possibly 6082     t6 temper.

Just like Pete says, it's best to keep weight aloft to the minimum
