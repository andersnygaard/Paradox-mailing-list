Subject: Re: New guy question about interior finish

Thanks for the quick responses. FYI, I'm in Milwaukee Wisconsin, USA and do most of my sailing on Lake Michigan.

The application guide for cetol implies that it should go on over bare wood. I haven't used it before, so I'll try it for at least some of the interior wood surfaces.

Thanks again for the responses.
