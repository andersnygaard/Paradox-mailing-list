Subject: Re: Colour Schemes

Derek,

The epoxy needs to be shielded from the rays of the sun to protect its vulnerability to the Ultraviolet component of the visible light spectrum. You will need to coat the epoxy with varnish that has UV inhibitors or paint. Paint has the opacity to shield the UV from the epoxy.

As for colors: take a look at the traditional boats in your area and then select a color that is complimentary in the color scheme just to offer an alternative and keep your self visible.

These would be the colors on a color wheel that reside opposite the standard, accepted colors of the area. For example: The compliment of blue is orange. The result will be phenomenal. If you pick a color that is similar to the prevailing color of the water or landscape in y0our sailing grounds, you will be harder to see. A white sail goes a long way towards visibility, though it isn't necessarily a good thing.
