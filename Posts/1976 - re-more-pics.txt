Ok, I hope this helps everyone. It seems that Yahoo has limited the size of pictures in the photo section to 400 pixels and kept the full size for those who want to order prints (does anyone ever do this?) and that is why you can't get access to the larger pictures.

I have taken the liberty to reduce the size of the two new pictures to 640x480 resolution and posted them in the files section in the ParaPlastic folder. If you want to see more detail, save the image to your computer and enlarge it with your image program. these images are still very good quality at 200% enlargement.

If still more detail is wanted I would ask that you contact the author and ask that he e-mail you a hi-res image. In this way we will keep the file sizes to a manageable one.

One more request is that if you post images to the files section please reduce them to a least 800x600 and preferably 640x480. If you do not have the capability to do this then myself or one of the other members will be glade to help out. Just keep the pictures coming.

Thanks Paul for bringing this to my attention and to everyone for being patient.
