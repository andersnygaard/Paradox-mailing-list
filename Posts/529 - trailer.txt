Hi All,

Glen,

I am rebuilding my trailer, as I have it now, there is 24 3/4 inches from the ground to the bottom of the boat. Do you think I have it low enough for the ramps around the Gulf Coast area? If I go with Pontoon Tires I should be able to get another 3 inches. I also have a tilt trailer.

Thanks
David
