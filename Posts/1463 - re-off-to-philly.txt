Hi Derek,

My apologies. As a co-moderator - my note was meant to confirm with 
Glen that I had received his instructions.

The last comment was a feeble attempt at humour. I have no beef with 
Don or anyone else for that matter. Obviously I must be more careful 
with peoples sensitivities as the internet does not always get the 
message out with a person's true intentions and may be misconstrued.

Cheers, Nels
