I'm deep in study-and-learn phase right now.  I have a pile of plans from Jim Michalak plus the Paradox plans and the Bolger Tortoise plans, and I've been reading everything I can find on the subject of boats and boating.

One thing has come through very clearly -- the simpler the boat, the cheaper it will be to maintain it.  This is definitely an argue in favor of building, since you know you can readily fix it yourself.  (Which is one reason I tend to build most of my own ham radio equipment.  My QRP amp has gone through three sets of final power transistors, and if it weren't for the fact that I stockpile them in quantity and can readily replace them myself...)

There's no question that the season would be longer in a site-inside boat.  I am currently flirting with the idea of taking the Paradox sit-inside concept and applying it to a PDRacer hull.  This would give me a boat that can be car-topped, and yet comfortably be sailed in the cold and rain.  Those of you who boat in Texas instead of New England may not understand. :-)
