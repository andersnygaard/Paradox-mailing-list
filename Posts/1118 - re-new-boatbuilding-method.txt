Dear Glen. 

Urethane foam is very common, it has many aplications in the construction and insulation idustry. Urethane is sold in any store where they sell fiberglass. Its comes in two liquid parts, Isocianato and Polyol. When are combined they expand through a chemical process, which in less than 15 minutes transform in to rigid foam.

You can buy or make yourself urethane foam plates. My advice is to buy it in the refrigeration supplier industry and you can save a lot of work for a few dollars.  However if you can?t found them, you can build them easily, without sophisticated machines.

Best Regards 
Antonio Bordeu.
