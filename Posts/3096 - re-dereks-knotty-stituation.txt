Subject: Re: Derek's Knotty Stituation

On the phone there was much sucking of teeth and the uspoken suggestion that because I bought the timber last year it was out of guarantee, or the knots had grown/come loose since.

Now that it is all in printable form they are being slower with their answers or suggestions.

I have suggested in my email that if I suffered a boom breakage that put me in danger they would definitely hear from me again.
I am hoping that what ever the reply is it will at least be well thought out.

And what was their answer?

Get Lost ... Come on in ... We don't know nothin' about no knots
