Subject: Appox build time, plans, cost??

Hello all,

I suppose this is answered somewhere but I can't find the info. Does anyone have an approximate build time for a Paradox? I have the basic stitch and glue building skills. I've looked at the few plan pages I've found on-line and and my guess is about 300hrs to get  a basic sailing boat. 

Also what is an estimated build materials cost, East Coast USA? Can anyone supply me a materials list?

Next, where can I buy plans? i tried the contact in the FAQ section of this site and the link doesn't work. 

Thanks
Edward
