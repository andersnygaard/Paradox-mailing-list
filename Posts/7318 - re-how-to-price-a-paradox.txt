Like all used and/or homebuilts, It is worth what someone will pay for it. Folks rarely recover the actual worth in time or materials, but such builds are undertaken as a labor of love (so to speak). And naturally, boats with a reputation and long track record (such as Zoe, my old boat) fetch more.

Seems to me there were two recent sales, one in Texas and one in Washington - were they not in the 2k to 3k range?

I have struggled with the value of TARDIS.  How much do I as for her in a sale?  I need help here.  I have put a $3000 price on her.  Is that realistic?  Too much, too little?  I would like to hear from all you readers out there.
