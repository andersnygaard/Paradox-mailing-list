I used the full amount of glass fibre cloth and a lot of resin on my hulls bottom
Double bias cloth, it’s stiff, thick and hard to work, I hired a boatbuilder to help me, or rather I helped him. It’s a peculiar cloth and you need some help or great advice to get it flat and free from bubbles and imperfections.
The bottom is 19 mm marine ply, and the glass cloth and west system epoxy made it so very tough. It has two layers of double bias cloth and resin and a coat of antifoul over undercoat. I’ve hit a few things, and run aground slowly twice, no damage at all, none but a little mark in the paint, my boat gets more damage on the road towing it on a trailer, than In the sea sailing.
And your right, putting runners under the boat may effect its handling?
I had the best time building it, I hope you enjoy that as much as I did.

The fun is not over when it’s built either, learning to sail it well is a fun job too.

White paint helps to find things easier than when they are hidden in the resin wood coloured shelves, you can just see some pipe work, that’s connected to the tank under the mid-floor.
The hook hanging over the boat helped turn over to seal the bottom and lower the ballast lead into the bilges.

My water tank was welded white plastic made by a man who makes tanks for off-road vehicles, it’s strong and can be removed, just, but it’s a big job. Remember no clear pipe on the water system, keep the light out of it, so no algae can grow, flush it each trip and always have clean water to fill it. The make it clean keep it clean principle.
The bosuns chair here was scrapped, it’s too hard, the upholstery strapping chair describes elsewhere on the blog is my new chair and I sit mostly in a reinforced kiddies bean bag, it’s also part of my bedding at night.
