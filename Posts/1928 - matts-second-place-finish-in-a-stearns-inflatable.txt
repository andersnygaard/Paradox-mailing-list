Subject: Matt's second place finish in a Stearns' inflatable

I looked at the site and see Matt wrote an interesting article on placing second in a West Marine Stearns' inflatable kayak of all things. Is there anything he can't place well in? Did anyone see this article before, I don't remember it mentioned?
