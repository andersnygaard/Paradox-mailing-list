Subject: Re: Charcoal Stove

The flowerpot guy doesn't know much science.  A candle gives off heat-
no argument there.  But there's no point in "concentrating" it 
or "radiating" it.  The rate at which you generate heat is governed 
by how fast the candle uses fuel, and how efficiently it burns that 
fuel.  Trouble is, a candle isn't all that efficient because it also 
give off partially-burned fuel (which is why it glows--that glow is 
soot particles heated to high temps).  You don't want to breathe 
that.  It also gives off a fair amount of water, which you probably 
also don't want.  Whatever your source of heat, it would be a good 
idea to vent it, either with a dedicated chimney or by cracking the 
hatch, since most burning produces noxious gases.  I'm planning on 
adding a kerosene wick stove with a simple copper pipe for venting it-
this mainly for cooking indoors in cold.  

Storing heat is a different matter.  A brick or whatnot would work, 
but in terms of simple ability to store the most heat in the smallest 
package, it's hard to beat plain water.  Since I have a drafty cabin 
that's virtually impossible to heat, I favor filling a hot water 
bottle from the tea kettle and putting it down my sleeping bag.  I 
got the idea from Charles Stock, who's been sailing 3 seasons for 
decades.
