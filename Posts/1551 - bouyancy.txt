Subject: Bouyancy

Hi,

Can somebody help me out with these questions, please?

What exactly is meant by buoyancy for a Paradox? Is it that if full of water it will float with the deck level with the sea surface?

When you build in a particular material how do you work out how much foam you need for buoyancy? Do different types of foam give different levels of buoyancy?

Cheers,
Derek
