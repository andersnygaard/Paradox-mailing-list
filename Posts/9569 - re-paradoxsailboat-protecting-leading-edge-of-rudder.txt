I wrapped the leading edge with Teflon rub rail

I had an old piece of half round bronze that was on the bow of my former
thistle dinghy. I screwed it to the leading edge and bottom of the rudder
and filled voids with thickened epoxy. I had problems with both hitting the
bottom and forgetting to raise the rudder before pulling the boat up the
ramp.

Hello Fellow Paradoxians;

I am interested to ideas from others on protecting the leading edge of
the rudder. Too often it become the default depth finder.

Please share any ideas you have or taken to militate against damage to
the leading edge of the rudder usually caused by hitting rocks, or other
hidden objects.

Much obliged,
Deric
