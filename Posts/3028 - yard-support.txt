Subject: Yard support

The geometry of the sail means that when reefing the yard moves aft and there is little to keep it close to the mast (on stbd tack). At a recent boat rally I was having a look at a Welsford Houdini. This boat had a lugsail which could be sailed reefed much like Paradox, but there is a traveller on the mast which keeps the yard close to the mast at all times. 

Do you think that Paradox would benefit from a similar arrangement?

It would mean, with the Mk.1 sail, that the boom would have to lift as the sail was reefed, which may cause a problem.

Ideas anyone?
