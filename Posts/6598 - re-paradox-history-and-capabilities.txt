I was trying to create conditions as close to real sailing conditions as I could, though I noticed afterwards that I had forgotten to lower the rudder. I reasoned that in the sort of weather where there was a danger of a knock-down I would long before have retreated below with the hatch shut.

As it was, once the boat was well over, I was not sitting on the bottom but sprawled against the side bins. If you look carefully at the video you may notice that I squirmed around a bit to see the effect. My helpers did not report any significant effect on the mast-head load.

As an entirely separate issue, it should be noted that afterwards nothing had been displaced from It's storage position. This is with the as-designed bins and some shock cord retainers on the shelves. Even the kettle was still on the stove! (though it wasn't lit)

Hoping for calm nights
