Topping Lift

It seems to me that builders and users of Paradox have preferences when it comes to employing a topping lift. At the moment I am undecided whether to have one. Matt, guru, and accomplished Paradox aficionado, even the designer, dispenses with one on his original and proven vessel.

Although the boat is a complicated little beast made of many parts, essentially her concept is one of simplicity; for example, she has no standing rigging, neither does she have a foresail and being conceived as a minimal cruiser she has a yuloh for alternative propulsion.

I'm in favour of keeping things simple; therefore my natural inclination would be to follow Matt's lead by doing without a topping lift, but what are the advantages of this minimal approach, or in fact, would it be disadvantageous not to have a topping lift?
