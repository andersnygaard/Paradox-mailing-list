Hey Everyone,

I'm leaving tomorrow morning for the Apalachicola Bay and St George Sound area to scout it out. I plan on leaving my truck in Carrabelle Beach where I will launch "Zoe". That is on the eastern side of the sound which is about 30 miles long. I will probably be anchoring around St George Island state park. If anyone is in the area for the weekend and wants to check out a Paradox and maybe go for a sail try to get an e-mail off to be before 7:00 tomorrow morning and we will try to meet up. If we don't hook up by e-mail, like I said I will be around the state park in the afternoon on Sat for sure and maybe Fri evening as well.

PS David if you can get down it would be great but I know this is very short notice. Just looks like the weather is going to be great for the next few days, maybe a little chilly, but clear and breezy. I will be able to tell you more about the place when I return.
