Subject: Re: Paradox Trailer Bolt

Hi , I have a U bolt through my bow
Remember if it's placed too high it forces the boat nose down as you winch it , and can make loading onto the trailer difficult
I was towed by the coast guard for three hours in pounding seas that shook the boat violently all the way in and it never worried the U bolt or the bow

Hello Paradoxians,

One of the features "The Edge" does not have is the U-bolt or eye bolt typical on boats at the bow used to hoist the boat onto its trailer.

I have looked at many pictures of other paradox boats and notice many have the bolt. I often wondered why Don Elliott never had one installed on his boat. In order for me to get the boat on the trailer, I hook the end of the cable (rope) line around the cleats at the bow. It does pull the boat onto the trailer but it does force the bow down under the rubber block as well as not pull the boat straight to the V shape rubber block, and so, I spend more time messing with the set up than needed.

Anyone have thoughts of where to place the trailer bolt? 6 inches from deck of bow or other measurement?

Any comments of what not to do? It seems like a basic set up, and why bother asking for sharing of ideas right? Well if I am to drill a hole in the boat, I would like to drill one hole.

I may be the only paradox boat owner without the trailer eyebolt / u -bolt on the bow. It seems like a have to have item to me.

Fairwinds,
