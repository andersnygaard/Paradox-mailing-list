I've found that this tiller arrangement works pretty well on Little Cruiser so I'm not sure if reengineering the steering arrangements on Paradox is worth the trouble. The only suggestion that I might make if you are at all concerned about sealing the transom opening completely is to use a vinyl "boot" that goes around the tiller and is attached to the transom.  This is what we have done on Little Cruiser.
