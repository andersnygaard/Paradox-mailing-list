Subject: Re: A proposal, a real one

DC:

I'm a tech writer (despite the many typos you may have seen in my posts). I would contribute editorial services and book building experience to the manual you propose. Since I'm a totally incompetent boat builder, and lack the lexicon of an experienced one, I would love to have a manual that clarifies esoteric building terminology, provides a procedural schedule for building Paradox, and explains difficult tasks (such as rolling bevels) to inexperienced woodworkers.

Other useful items for the manual might be a bill of materials, an errata section, and directions for sailmakers.

Lemme know if you would like my help.
