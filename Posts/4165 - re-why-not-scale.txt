If you have a Mac, a "Mac-ized" version of Openoffice is available at www.neoofice.org with a very nice Aqua interface.

Though it's in Beta (03, I think) it is very stable and translates all the .doc and .xlt files I've thrown at it perfectly.

Allowed me to mothball my windoze machine and I didn't need to pay for Microsoft bloatware.
