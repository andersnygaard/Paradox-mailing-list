I will hold off on posting any more of my updated plans until I get everything worked out. I need to make a couple changes to the cabin supports and will add in the window sizes.

If I ever get the "final" designs drawn up, I plan to have a PDF file to share with the complete plans but there is still a lot of editing to do before that is ready. We should be able to delete all my wrong drawings to clean up your Gorfnik album too.

As I see it, we still have the cabin top, leeboards, and rudder assembly to go. I am real curious how you control the rudder from inside. I assume it is with ropes like the Paradox.

Keep posting when you have time but put your boating time first. Gorfnik and Paradox probably extend the boating season a bit but ...
