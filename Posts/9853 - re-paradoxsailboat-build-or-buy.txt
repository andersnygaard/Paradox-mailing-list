Morning Nick,

Congratulations on a lovely looking Paradox build. Some questions

There appears to be 3 pipes leading into the water tank under floor near the vent box.
Are these for filling. How many litres does the water tank hold and is it easy to remove?

There also seems t9 be a box where the removable seat would be, is this correct?

When lying down what is the length of sleeping area?

By the way, I’ve read somewhere a wheelbarrow inner tube acts as a very good cushion.

Where to you keep the petrol can for the out board motor?

What is the all up weight of the trailer and the Patadox.?

Last what is the make and  length of the jet ski trailer?

All the best
Tony

 The boat is in good condition on a modified jet ski trailer
All in good order
The sail was professionally made
The mast was made by a ship Wright at his workshop in Mt. Barker SA
It’s anti fouled on the bottom and has good quality fittings , Ronson brand pulleys
The boat is constructed as per the plan without modification
The water tank is removeable and made from PVC , again made professionally by Abber Tanks in Queensland , I have several of his tanks and they all are sturdy and well made
The windows need renewing they are crazed but intact
The anchor is a big expensive job with its own custom roller , it will hold in any ground , I tried three types of anchor and this one will hold under any condition , it’s over sized and I’ve slept confidently in the boat at anchor . I tend to sleep ashore , pull it up on a beach and sleep till the tide changes , it’s an adventurous capable fun boat , made very tough .
I made sure each joint was 100% glued , no gaps . The bottom of the hull has two layers of double bias thick as hell fibreglass cloth on it , and is made with 19 mm marine ply , the whole boat was made with marine ply , some Kapur and some Oregon as well , it’s tough as hell . The mast is a bids mouth hollow round mast made from hoop pine .
There is bouyancy foam used throughout the build in the fore deck side deck and transom and rear and front compartment floor , by my calculations it would float if swamped .
I’ve rolled it on purpose and it came up easily with no action on my part but to lay there waiting , it came up fast . Some months later I then got rolled at sea by a breaking wave that caught me broadside , it came up fast once the sail dumped its load of water . I have supreme confidence in its ability to keep me safe .
There is a large expensive off shore lit compass in the gap between the mast box and the port side hull . All shelves etc are there as per the plan . It cost me $8500 to build five years ago and took eight months to complete . It has a Honda 2.5 hp outboard and the Yuloh oar , though I e never used the Yuloh they are useless at sea , in calm water they are fine , if you have the knack to use them .
This boat is a genuine great built hardy example of a fun machine that I have sailed a lot , I can no longer sail much , I had an accident and can no longer enjoy sailing as I once did .
Paradoxes are lively to sail , always moving , they need practice to get the best out of them . I have made two other boats before this one and had the ship Wright help on the harder bits on all my boats .
Hope this is useful info
Nick

I started out wanting to build a Paradox when I found someone here had one for sale, and now I'm considering buying one instead of building one. Does anyone else know of any Paradox's for sale?  I bought the Paradox Builders Manual by Don Elliott and he said he thought it would take the average Builder four months to build and he said the wood cost him $200 (but that was 20 years ago). The guy that's selling one said he thought the total materials might be $2000 but he said I should ask the group here. Has anyone here kept track of what the total materials cost is these days? And any estimate of how long it would take the average builder to complete? These numbers would help me decide to build or buy. I will also need a trailer if I build, so if anyone has one for sale or can help me find one I sure appreciate it. Thank you.
