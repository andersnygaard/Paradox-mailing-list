At lunchtime today I flicked through a daily tabloid to see what was going on in the big bad world. 

And there it was; a sail emblem for Paradox!

I am of course talking about the story of unusual stone sculptures being left randomly at adresses in Yorkshire.

Each sculpture carries a tag, clearly written by the same person, saying: 'Twinkle, twinkle like a star, does love blaze less from afar?' 

On the reverse side is an ancient symbol - the Chi Rho cross - with letters arranged around it to spell the word 'paradox'. 

I suspect we have a Paradox lover out there who worships the boat in an almost religious context!
I'll be keeping my eyes out for a boat with an unusual carved figurehead.......
