Congrats on your progress Bengt. Here is a website to look at.

The man "Dynamite Payson" built boats like Paradox using only 
polyester resin and ring nails for joinery and seam taping and 
covered the bottoms with glass and polyester. Many he only covered 
the seam joints. I have seen his work and it is great!

He started doing that about 30 years ago and a lot of his boats are 
still around. However he now recommends using epoxy if you can afford 
it. If polyester is only 1/4 of the cost, it is worth looking at, as 
it probably has improved in the last 40 years. There is also a 
vinylester resin that is used in kayak building but I am not sure how 
useful it is for the homebuilder. I know it is stronger than 
Polyester. But you definitely cannot put polyester over top of epoxy 
although you can put epoxy over polyester.

If I was working on a tight budget I would consider using poly rather 
than leaving the bottom unprotected. But you have to decide and live 
with the decision. Oh also, if the boat is in the water most of the 
time, polyester is not the best choice.

What kind of plywood are you using? You might be able to get away 
with just glassing the bottom and using several layers of paint on 
the rest. Maybe consult with Sven Yrvind and see what he thinks. What 
area of Sweden are you in? I just got back from there in July. I 
visited Oslo first and then went up to Finland and back down as far 
as Lykeskil. That is an incredible area for boating. But lots of 
rocks!

Good luck, Nels
