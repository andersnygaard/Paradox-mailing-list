Kjell, couldn't get the web site up. thanks for the info.


Proaconstrictor, others,

If you want to read more about the Divinycell and sandwich theory, there is an interesting handbook to download at http://www.diabgroup.com/DIAB/filecabinet.nsf/LookupFiles/DIAB Sandwich Handbook/$file/DIAB Sandwich Handbook.pdf
interesting, that is, if you've got a PhD in physics (I don't).

It occurs to me that my postings have a slight Sweden-chauvinistic odour. Please forgive me. That is due to Sven Yrvind's thrive to be in full control of every detail, I think. (When he decided to have a inboard motor in one of his earlier Bris, he took a job at the norwegian manufacturer, to learn every screw). He wants to penetrate every chemical formula and get a personal relation to his suppliers, which limits the geographical radius.In this way he also gets respect and may recruit sponsors. At least, this is my interpretation. Anyhow, I am sure that, if you might be interesting of "the Bris material", you will find a compatible brand in a store near you.

sincerely,
Kjell Karlsson
