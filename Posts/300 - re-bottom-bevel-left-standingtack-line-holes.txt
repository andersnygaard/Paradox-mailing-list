If I remember the plans correctly the two holes for the tack line are about a 1/4" in diameter and a few inches deep.

How do you coat a hole like that without filling the hole up with epoxy . . . or at least making the hole too small to get a line through?

I coat every hole I drill with at least two coats of epoxy and usually three. If the hole is in plywood I will treat as follows. 
After coating the first time with straight epoxy and allowing the end grain to soak up all it can, I mix up a thickened batch with cabasill 
and coat the edge. This will act as an armor coating.
