Great Stuff Glen,

For those of us who are more recent members I am hoping you will be able to post some photos or even a sketch of HM. I am wondering how it would compare with the lines you have in the files, with Little Cruiser, Paradox and Jesse Cooper? Of course there is a lot more to a design than just the profiles. But a lot of people would be interested in how this hull shape does in open water, in the larger sizes. 

Cheers, Nels
