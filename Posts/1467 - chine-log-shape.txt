Subject: Chine Log shape

One thing that has puzzled me on the plans is the shape of the Chine Log shown on the bottom of sheet 5. I see the sheer clamp above it, looks like it will tuck in to the top right corner of bulkhead 3 shown on the same page just to the left of it. Why is the shape of the chine log as shown not flat on the bottom? Even if it is rotated 90 degrees to the right and it is supposed to tuck into the left corner, the flare of the sides is not near 16 degrees, only a few. Am I looking at this wrong?

Thanks again,
Paul
