Hi All,

I just got through sanding the paint off the bottom, It looks good except a place around blk # 3, the ply looked dark so i ground the glass off, the ply feels damp, no rot just damp. My plan is to grind the glass off all around it and let it dry, then lay the roving.

What do you Guys think ?
