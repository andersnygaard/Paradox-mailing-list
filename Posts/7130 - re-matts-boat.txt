Hello Folks,

I just had to comment on my observation regarding the word choice of "wizard" in describing Matt. Nat Herreshoff was also called the Wizard - for short - or the Wizard of Bristol during his time.

I think it would be super if there was a museum someday that had all of Matt's designs and boats, tools, and history on display.

Great Regards to Matt.

Best,
Deric

Nels, Trying to get into Matt's head is presumptuous but weather is a roll of the dice even in Florida on the first of March. It could be 35 deg and raining or 80 deg and sun. So, what do you prepare for? Obviously, for the worse case which is cold and rain. An important part of finishing this event is the condition of the crew, which can be the biggest component in finishing. The boat will not go farther than the crew. Gary "Lugnut" showed/taught me that. Also, knowing the course is important. Extrapolating water, wind conditions from the chart is faulty at best and some first hand knowledge can supply important information. He found a great place to anchor at 11 pm when our brains were beginning to fail. The spot provided cover from the wind shift expected to reach gale force and we were rested and ready to go at daybreak after the front passed. That in retrospect was more important than the boat or sailing talent. There is a standard mantra WWWD among watertribers. What would Wizard Do? He is the Wizard of the course, not counting his other talents.
