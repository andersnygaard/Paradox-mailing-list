My original design sketch, for a much larger 25' sloop,  had a heat shield that when open acted as a reflector and when closed covered the glass to protect it and to dim the light produced. The glass chimney would vent into a metal flue that would pass through the cabin top.   An aside on alcohol and kerosene appliances: I read a hint attributed to the "Pardey's" about adding a little denatured alcohol to your kerosene to ruduce the oder put out by a lamp. Apparently if you get the right mixture of air and vapors in an enclosed vessel combustion can occur.  From my experience this is lots of fun in an enclosed space.

Brian,

I was thinking along the lines of a bulkhead mounted oil lamp with a brass funnel and flue above. I've seen this set up vented into a dorade box on deck. I'm not sure if there's actually enough room on a Paradox main bulkhead, or how best to mount and fabricate a 1" charlie nobel. When and if I build one of these boats I will be trying to sort this out with an Aladin mantle lamp.
