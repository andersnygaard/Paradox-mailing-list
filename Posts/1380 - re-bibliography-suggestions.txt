I would strongly recommend any of Dynamite Payson's books.

I had the honor of meeting the man some years ago - I just dropped in 
unexpectedly to purchase a set of "Cartopper" plans and was invited 
to spend the entire afternoon with him and Amy and his son.

I would say he is the American equivalent of Percy Blanchford. He 
gives full value for any and everything he offers, and has great 
respect for the home boat builder.
