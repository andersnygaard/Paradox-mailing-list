Subject: Gorfnik on wrong forum


Hi Pete,

I agree with you that Gorfnik details should not have been posted in this group. My intent at first was simply to advise that I had succeeded in building a simpler boat which was inspired by the Paradox design and shares many of its advantages.

I will remove all photos except a few and advise folks who are interested to check out the end of the build sequence and cruise results on the Microcruising group.

Sorry to have overly intruded the Paradox group, which I appreciate immensely since I do also sail a Paradox.

Best regards,

André-François Bourbeau
