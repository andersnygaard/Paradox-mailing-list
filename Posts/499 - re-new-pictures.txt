Very nice! I like the removable rear window. I have been toying with something like that myself.

Is the trailer a standard job, or was it built/modified for Whisper? I have been giving much thought to the trailer as I want to be able to launch/recover from a slip without getting the hubs wet, and also launch/recover onto a flat beach (when the tide is out). Can you do this with your trailer?
