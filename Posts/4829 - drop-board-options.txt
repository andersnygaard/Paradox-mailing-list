Subject: Drop board options

I created a folder in the photo section with the above title. It has three photos with captions of one way of doing it. This drop board is maybe a "compromise". You have to lift it almost halfway up before it comes out. I have another very light plywood board with a bug screen for summer weather. Not nearly as user friendly as it doesn't have the delrin runners.

Feel free to add your own ideas to the file. One I know of is to have a screened insert with a sliding shutter. Another a shielded vent intended for attic ventilation in a building:-)
