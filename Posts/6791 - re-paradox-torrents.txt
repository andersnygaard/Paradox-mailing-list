The PHRF racing around here has a 20 foot minimum length, so no race.
I didn't time my build because it's playtime for me and I didn't want to spoil it. I didn't watch the expense either because I had no budget. I just spent my pocket money slow and carefull. I found out sailing with my wife on board that there was no place for her to sit and be in the breeze too. on the fore deck made the boat tippy. I widened my cabin sole as far as I could. Look at "Ironsides" photos.
Good luck
