Oh, You have me worried now Derek since I am a microlight flyer. 

But it's never happened to me, ever . Variations in lift caused by being in the lee of obstructions while landing yes; but complete loss of lift never. There is always some lift as long as the aircraft is travelling forward through the air......may not be quite enough to hold you up though....;-(

The nearest I got to that while sailing was while trying to sail through Poole lifting bridge thirty odd years ago.  Completely lost the breeze while while under the bridge and started to go backwards due to the tide.

I had to get through somehow - I had no engine - so managed to scrounge a tow through.  Once through the bridge itself found a breeze and sailed out alongside Poole quay with applomb. 

Happy days. Probably against all the regulations to sail through there now, eh?

Jim Hall
