Hi Jim.

Open up Google Earth, download free if you don't have it, then type in Ramsgate,UK and it opens up bang on the marina.
You will be able to follow the rest of Bills trip and others from then on.
There is a new update download that will show even greater detail.
The detail is such that you can see people or their shadows! Let alone cars and boats and scale them off.
SUPER.
