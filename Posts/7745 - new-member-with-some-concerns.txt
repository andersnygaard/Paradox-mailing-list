Subject: New Member With Some Concerns

I'm interested in the Paradox, but am concerned about getting in and out of the cockpit due to bad knees and shoulders -- too much young and dumb is finally catching up with me. I will make a mockup to check these issues, but I need some information that isn't on the study plans.

Getting up from the floor is a major ordeal. It's quite practical from a 9" footstool, and may be doable from something lower. I haven't tested my limits yet. My long torso means that anything higher than about an inch will require modifications to the cabin.

Raising the roof or lowering the sole have been discussed. A third alternative would be to create a footwell immediately in front of the seat. This well could be covered with a panel for sleeping.

Can anyone tell me the distance from the sole to the hull in this area? It looks as though it might be as much as 6 inches. If so, that would be good news.

It would also be helpful to know the height of the grab handles and the distance from the handles to the aft cabin bulkhead.
