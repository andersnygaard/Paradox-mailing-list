First, visit http://home.triad.rr.com/lcruise/paradox1.htm.

I can give you a very simplified idea of what the chine runners do.

Imagine a disc, the diameter of a tennis ball, mounted square on to 
a fluid flow. It will experience a force because the fluid that hits the 
disc stops, and transfers its momentum to the disc.

Now imagine a tennis ball cut in half with the open side towards the 
fluid flow. Due to the hemispherical shape the fluid enters the ball 
(or cup) and is deflected back out. This reversal of flow transfers 
twice the momentum to the cup than was transferred to the disc so 
it experiences twice the force.

You can see this in operation in a rotating-cup anemometer.

The chine runner extensions behave a bit like the cup and cause 
the water to be deflected back, rather than just slowing it down as 
ordinary chines would.

This is obviously a gross simplification, but I hope it helps you to 
understand the concept.
