Morning Derek.

Scarfing 3 pieces of wood together is a skilled job. Just think what you are trying to do and the amount of extra time over and above just making the spar from the new piece of wood. If joining three pieces of wood together there will be a good chance of the spar having a kink in it.
Joining timber together as you intend to do is not done by a mortise and tenon joint. The timber must be joined with a scarf joint (I won't go into birdmouth scarf's) of at least 8 to 1. So if the spar is 2" thick, this will give you a scarf of 16" in length. If any of the 4 scarf's are not finished flat or out by a fraction of a degree, the spar when glued will have a kink in it. Add to that you intend to make it from 3 pieces, it will be highly likely this will happen. Make the boom from the new piece of wood. Imagine sailing your new Paradox, which you are justly proud of having made a fine job, only to have to look down a kinked boom every time you go sailing because it is always stuck in your line of site. It would drive me up the wall, and a new one would be on my workbench being made PDQ.
