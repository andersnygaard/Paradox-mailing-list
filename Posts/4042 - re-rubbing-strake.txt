Al,
I just checked them out.
With Robbins Elite the basic sheets (from waht I can tell) would cost 
me =A3548.
Clarkswood Far Eastern comes out at =A3252.
That's =A3300 cheaper!
I'm tempted by that. It's obviously up to the job and most of it will 
be layered in glass and epoxy anyway.

Anyway, I went and got some US dollars today and have sent off for the  
plans. I just need to see if theres anyway of wriggling out of 
decorating the kitchen and hallway now.....
