A mistake I keep on making is to assume that everyone is sailing in my home waters. If the waters were clear and open then an echo sounder would probably be superfluous. Where I sail the water is often the consistency of a good Brown Windsor Soup (though without the temperature or flavour). With narrow channels flanked by gently shelving mud banks the choice (without a sounder) is short tacks or risk grounding. To make headway against a contrary tide neither is satisfactory.

I tend to agree about the electrics, but we do like our toys, don't we?

Now a petrol outboard on my Paradox would be quite dangerous. Others I have seen keep the fuel on deck. I have made 2 lengthy trips and on both of them the conditions were such that anything stored on deck would have been washed off (even the white PVC tape I used to mark out the sheer was washed off at the bows). The idea of storing fuel below decks doesn't bear thinking about, so no petrol outboard for me.

Sorry if my comment on the depth sounder came over in the wrong tone,
I was not having a go at anyone.

I was just question whether a boat of this size really requires so
many electronic gizmo's?. It is a value judgement. I have enough
problems talking to outboard motors!!.

All the best for your future sailing.
