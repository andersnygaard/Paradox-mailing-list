Subject: Welcome to Paradoxbuilders2

I've started this group to serve as an overflow for photos and files specific to the Paradoxbuilders group, the Paradox design, and other works by Matt Layden.

Please continue to utilize the available photos and files storage at Paradoxbuilders. Please keep the discussion at Paradoxbuilders.

I hope that everyone will feel at ease to contribute.
