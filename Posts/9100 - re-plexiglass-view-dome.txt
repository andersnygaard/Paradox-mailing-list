The view from the inside is very good and very necessary. I find that the view from the hatch is obscured by the sail especially on the lee side. So it is very necessary to steer from inside while looking through the windows. I do this a lot not just because of the view but also because I am out of the blazing sun and weather and the additional bonus is the sound of the water around the hull.
