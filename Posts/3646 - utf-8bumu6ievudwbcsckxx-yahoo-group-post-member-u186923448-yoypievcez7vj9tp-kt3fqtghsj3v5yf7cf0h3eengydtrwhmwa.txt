The rain is holding me up too.  I managed to bevel the aft end of the 
bottom piece and I was hoping to do the forward end today, but it'll 
have to 
wait until the sun comes out.  Then I'll need at least 4 days to let 
the epoxy set thoroughly.  Getting the temperature for this out of 
doors is 
dependent upon the weather, and doing it in the garage may not be 
possible.  Even if I was able to do it in the garage, the boat would 
have to be left outside.  It's all a juggling act.
