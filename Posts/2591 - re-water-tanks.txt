Subject: Re: water tanks

On Little Cruiser we don't use the water tanks as designed because of the reasons you have given. However, we still use the space to hold cans as well as fresh water but in their own individual containers. The benefit of using this system is that when you use water up you can then utilize the missing space to hold other items. This helps in redistributing ballast better, and we think that it is a lot safer to have your water in many different containers in case of contamination or leakage. Finally, we'd suggest that you build the tanks as described but just to make the top removeable. You can add a rubber (closed cell window/door foam) to make it water proof. This is what we have done, and it has worked very nicely.
