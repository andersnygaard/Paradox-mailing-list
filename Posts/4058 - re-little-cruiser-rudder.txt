Subject: Re: Little Cruiser rudder

Paradox is like no other boat I know, but she sails well and is balanced well with the existing design. The rudder is used in conjunction with the chine runners to provide lateral resistance, in place of the traditional keel or centreboard. You'll note that the centre of effort on Paradox is more aft than is usual on most sailing boats - hence the leech of the sail overhangs the transom. Any changes to Matt's design is likely to put things out of balance. As she is, she is just right and finely tuned.

Regarding the pintle and gudgeon fittings, whatever you end up with, they should be subtantial. I've gone for bronze on all rudder fittings made exactly according to plan.

I appreciate my boat is not finished and that I have not sailed her, but I have had the priviledge of sailing Al's Paradox on two occasions and I can vouch she's a super boat to sail.
