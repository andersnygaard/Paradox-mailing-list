I have a question for the accomplished paradox builders. How did y'all go about scarphing the 1/2" (12mm) side panels? Did you scarph full panels?

I cut out the other components on the sheets and then scarfed what was left.

To save time I stacked all 6 pieces that need scarfing and cut the chamfer on them all in one go.

Hoping for calm nights
