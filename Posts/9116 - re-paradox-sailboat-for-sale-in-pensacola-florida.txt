Bummer! Hopefully it will get good use. I don't think there are plans out there for any of Matt's other designes.

The paradox was sold over a week ago.

I am hunting for an Elusion or a Enigma.... the lighter the better. I'd be willing to pay for someone to do much of the work.

Is the paradox still for sale? I'm interested. At the very least I'd want to come take a look. I've been playing around with the idea of building for a while now. Even bought plans and building guide. But this may be a better option.
