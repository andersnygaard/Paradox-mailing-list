Hello All,

I am very interested in building a Paradox however I have a problem ....

To get the completed boat out of my workshop it will need to pass between two buildings - the gap is 49" at its narrowest.

The specifications for Paradox state that the beam is 4'1/2" - i.e. 48.5".

My question to the group is whether 48.5" is in fact the maximum width of the completed boat ? If not what is the width ?

If so, I should be able to juggle it out of the workshop.

Otherwise, what is the height from the bottom of the hull to the top of the cabin - if less than the width I might be able to roll it on its side and get it out this way .......

Thanks,

Steve
