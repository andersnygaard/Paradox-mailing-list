Hi Jeff,
There are a few web sites you might try. 
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Hensnest/ look in Hedwig's folder for one 
of me under single reef in the gulf. Also give http://peephens.org/ a 
try. I will have some more on my site soon.

Hi G;len.
I have always been intrigued with the PEEP HEN design but have never been
able to find a photo of one sailing. Motoring with the sail just flapping
does not count.
How well do they sail and could you post any photos of one sailingl?
