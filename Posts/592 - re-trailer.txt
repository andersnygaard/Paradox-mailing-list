Hi Larry.

Thank you for the invite to the gathering at Cedar Key. It was my intention to make it this year with my Paradox "Zoe" but completely forgot about it until I received the latest issue of Messing About in Boats and saw the coverage of the event. I will do my best to be there next year. Are there any other Mess Abouts in the upcoming months in this area? David Beard and I are trying to get together some time soon so we can compare "Whisper" and "Zoe" while under sail.

I am only a two hour drive from Cedar Key and did my sea trials of "Zoe" from there to Clearwater. I'm looking forward to going back over for some more sailing.
