Dave, 

I once had a naval architect tell me that if you scaled a small boat up 10% or so, it would have very little effect on the character of the boat, whether it was just length, or length and beam.

I built two sharpies with that in mind and was pleased with the results.

I have since read in a Kayak building book I have somewhere of a formula (related to a sine wave, I think) that relates how to spread out the stations of a design to ensure consistent flow around a hull. I'll try to hunt that up.

I think you could scale up a Paradox to little cruiser size with no problem.
