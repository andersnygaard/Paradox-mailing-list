Hi Dave,

The paint I used was Awlgrip, 1qt, and I got three coats on with a little
left over. It was rolled and tipped. Roll the paint on vertically (no more
then about 6sq ft at a time) and then tip with a foam brush horizontally. I
always keep about 4 extra brushes in my pockets incase I get a blowout or
the brush gets soggy. Move quickly and put it on thin. Always brush into the
last area you brushed and not the other way around. This will work well for
enamels also but I have found that Awlgrip is the cheapest paint to buy
because it holds up so well (10 yrs) and the gloss doesn't fade, and it goes
so far. A 1 qt kit (paint, H3002 converter and T0031 reducer) will give you
53 oz of paint.

Yes I have used the HVLP outfits and love them but I would not recommend
spraying Awlgrip or any other two part polyurethane paint because when
atomized they are very poisonous, so mush so that the the person spraying
should be wearing a full face mask and breathing an oxygen rich mixture.

Hope this helps, let us know how they come out

Glen
