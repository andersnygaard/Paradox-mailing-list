Hi Jeff.

Dont panic.

I think we can all work this out some how.

What if one of us, that is someone that has a set of plans, photo copies their set and sends it to you and you send a check to Dave and Mindy less the cost of copying and post(I know, copyright). But hey. This is urgent!!!!!!!!

Here is the link to Dave and Mindies Yahoo site just in case you are not a member. http://groups.yahoo.com/group/microcruising/?yguid=67242575 and here is there other main site. http://www.microcruising.com/. The last message posted by Dave was just over two weeks ago. Perhap they have gone sail-a-bout.

Oh, welcome aboard.
