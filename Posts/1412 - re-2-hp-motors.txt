Hi again Nels.

Heavy boats tend to "carry" farther than light boats. Still, I would hesitate to speculate on how the Paradox design would perform under a pair of oars, let alone, how they would be stowed, or used. 

John Letcher (Leather?) wrote quite a lot about the viability of oars, aboard displacement sailboats. He used oars as his sole means of auxiliary power on a few boats. I wonder though, does he still?

I find sculling to be very relaxing. A rhythm exists, but the work is constant. If rowing is like a treadmill, then sculling must be like an elliptical trainer. I'm looking forward to using my "real" yuloh, as opposed to the regular oars I have used for the purpose in the past.
