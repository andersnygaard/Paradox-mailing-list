That's how I see it. Today I've been putting a longitudinal curve into the my yuloh by inserting a wedge. I may need to do another at the handle end. I want at least a 50m bend, perhaps more.

I'm not sure how to make the socket in the shaft. I had the ball made for me. I suppose the next job is to put that in place. Some people advocate setting the ball aft of the transom at a slight angle tilted away from the stern, but I think if there is sufficient longitudinal curve, the designed position would be best.

I am wandering if the mainsheet ever gets snagged on the ball. I understand that the sheet sometimes gets caught between the top of the rudder stock and the transom.

One or two people have outboard motors attached to the transome and for sure, the sheet will get caught on the motor. I notice Al has fitted his electric outboard on the port side so that the sheet does not get snagged.

Bill.
