Subject: Acrylic-Latex Paint

How well does this hold up on boats? Is there anything special about a primer? Is gloss or satin better? I'd like to hear of your experiences. I'm shure it will resist fading being acrylic. Will it harden hard enought to walk on, like for the deck? I have always used oil based paints for boats, like my dad did. I'm leary a bit. Thanks, Steve Yahn
