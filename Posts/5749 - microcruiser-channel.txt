I thought maybe some of you might be interested. We have just launched a new internet TV channel called the Microcruiser Channel. We already have a ton of videos of boat building, cruising, and even a whole series on sail making. There are a lot of new programs in the works. To watch all you have to do is visit our website at www.microcruiser.com.
