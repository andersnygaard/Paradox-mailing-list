There we go! I knew some of you had to be up to something. Great overheads and stills, Pete. The English countryside and rivers look so idyllic in summer.

A few questions:

1. Is the mast crutch set-up for a boom tent arrangement?

2. I'm guessing you went ashore for the shower and toilet? Toileting is something we never mention, but it is an issue. I've only been far enough offshore once to bucket and chuck it. The rest of the time I hold on or if I must, it's into a sealed container (which only has the capacity to be used once!) that I empty into a toilet on shore.

3. Are the solar panels for the Torqueedo? I notice that it changes to a Tohatsu in later pictures. Did the Torqueedo not make the cut?

This is all very inspiring! Even my wife is looking at these pictures and saying what about buying an old fiberglass river cruiser when we visit the UK?

Thanks for sharing,

Rob.
