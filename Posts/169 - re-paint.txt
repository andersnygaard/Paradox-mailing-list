Hi,

You might want to look at this article. It is on Dave Carnell's site. According to this the water based paint is not only acceptable, it is superior.

Hi David
I once used ext house paint on an old brown tri and got very good service out of it. It held up for the three years we lived aboard her and was sure easy to patch up dings and scratches. Of course it doesn't hold a gloss for as long and it is a bit of a bummer to remove should you decide to repaint with something other then latex in the future. I don't know if you can even find oil based house paints any more but that would be better and last longer then latex. Also West Marine's SEA GLOSS is pretty cheap for the quality. When I painted "Zoe" I only used a qt of awlgrip so you shouldn't need much. If you roll and tip the secret is to put on very thin coats (3), you will get a very smooth surface and reduce the risk of runs. Every one who has seen "Zoe" thinks the paint was sprayed on (would have been a lot faster). figure one coat a day to roll and tip. Hope this helps. By the way while on my test sail I jury rigged a topping lift to help in the roller furling dept, worked great. Have you had any luck with your furling?
