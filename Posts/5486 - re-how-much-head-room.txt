Subject: Re: How much head room?

Hello Bryan.   You may also want to look at the Michalak Robbsboat. It has dimensions very close to the paradox, in fact it is a dumbed down paradox clone. It could be built more quickly, and much cheaper.  It has 42" of "headroom".  Now, it's not as fancy as the paradox, or as pretty, but very close none the less.
