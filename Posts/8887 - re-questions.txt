Hi,

I built a paradox.

The space you're seeing on the picture of the bulkhead might be because it's tapered. The boat gets narrower as you get to the bow end, so to get a flat surface to glue properly, the bulkhead side must be smaller toward the front. So think of what it will look like from above, not as it's drawn from behind. It might make sense then?

Remember nearly all bulkhead edges, except I think the top edge (where the deck will glue onto) will have a taper, or bevel if you like, they are not right angled looking from above the boat.
