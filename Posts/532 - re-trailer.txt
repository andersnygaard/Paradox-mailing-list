Hey Dave,
        
My hull bottom is 15 inches from the ground and I was fearful that I would not be able to get "Zoe" out of the water at low tide when over at Apalachicola. Any thing you can do to lower "Whisper" on her trailer will be worth doing. There were some other boat ramps in the area where you could launch and retrieve her but not at the park at low water, at least not at the one that I used, I did not inspect the other but was told it was a little deeper. I think you would be ok at Cedar Key also as their ramp is pretty steep.

Tailwinds 
Glen

Hi All,

Glen,I am rebuilding my trailer, as I have it now, there is 24 3/4 inches from the ground to the bottom of the boat. Do you think I have it low enough for the ramps around the Gulf Coast area? If I go with 
Pontoon Tires I should be able to get another 3 inches. I also have a tilt trailer.

Thanks

David
