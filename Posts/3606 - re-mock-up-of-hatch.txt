Subject: Re: Mock up of Hatch

Looks like a good idea Derek. I'm sure that you have checked the boom clearence and considered the effect of the extra windage. If you have got it wrong, and it doesn't work out well, it's only a hatch and you could always substitute a normal one 

How's your hand  now? Are you able to work again?

I've opened a new album in photos named MoreEnuf and put in a picture of a cardboard 
mock up hatch.

I'd like to be able to use the seat even with the hatch closed (stiff knees) and also use the 
outboard with the hatch closed but the rear window open. 
The forward sloping face will be Lexan and there will be windows in each side.
I've decided on sliding (although there is still time to change my mind yet again) and the 
slider fittings will be inside the hatch.
I'd appreciate any comments before I commit myself to cutting ply tomorrow morning.
Thanks  ...  Derek
