Subject: Bulkhead question!

Hello,

I am ready to assemble Bulkhead #1.

Are the cleats and deck beam nailed on? In Caseys book it says hammer and drill will get sacrificed! If those parts are nailed together THEN epoxy coated, how will tools get epoxied?

I am waiting on my Ring nail order to come in. It seems to me nailing the deck beam on may split the laminates apart.

For the 19mm floor timber, is it critical to be 19mm? I don't have a plane and have 25/30mm boards, I suppose if it is indeed critical, I can plane it down by hand.

Thanks,
Erik
