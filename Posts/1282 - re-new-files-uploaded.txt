Very nice pump installation, Glen.

Having lived with boats with limber holes, and without, I have taken the perhaps unorthodox course of eliminating them aboard my boat. I know there are folks out there who believe that every boat must have limber holes. I think that some boats must have them, while others benefit from closed bilge spaces.

Aboard a boat with compartmentalized bilge spaces, keeping them separate allows a leak to be discovered before the cabin sole starts floating. When the leak is discovered, remedies may be attempted before the dangers of free surface effect come into play. In the mean time, stores and equipment in other bilge spaces are less likely to become damaged. 

In my case, I'll have a sponge/towel for regular water intrusion, a portable pump like a cylindrical Beckson, and a pump like yours for the unlikely event that the cabin sole becomes awash due to a roll with the hatch open, or some other catastrophic event. I like the Henderson pumps, though I'm not sure if one would fit...

Thanks for the photos!
