Subject: How do I rig my sail for windward ability
Date: Wed, 28 Apr 2010 05:11:29 -0000

Hello Everyone,

I'm interested in others' experience setting the lug sail for windward sailing. My paradox, Small Fry, has Matt's more recent version of the sail (slightly higher peak and shorter foot). In flat water and light to moderate wind I can point to about 55 to 60 degrees from the wind by the compass. My actual course would be worse due to leeway. In choppy conditions and more wind my windward ability pretty much dwindles to zero. For example, I once spent two days non-stop trying to beat to windward with winds about 20 to 25 knots and seas around 2 meters... and the result? Well, I ended up about 3nm in the wrong direction, at which time I headed back to port.

So, I'm wondering if perhaps I just don't know how to sail effectively. Maybe I've rigged the sail poorly. What windward experiences are others having?

Thanks,
Geoff.
