OMG! Don't you know that flat bottomed boats are only for protected bodies of water and not for the ocean.  Maybe there's time for you to attach a big lead keel to the boat to make sure it stays upright. Just kidding. I know that you will have a safe passage and a great time.  Portugal will be so nice to visit.  I lived there for several years in the early 1970's when I was a kid. The Portuguese people are very friendly, and the country is so beautiful.  Take care of yourself Glen and wear a safety harness while on watch.
