Subject: Re: Double Rudders

Thanks Jeff,

The original question about the possibility of two rudders centred around the proposal that a self-steering vane such at VectaVane could be mounted centrally between the rudders.  Additionally allowing a light outboard to take it's place.

It would not be a waste of time if a windvane could be mounted between them, especially if the windvane could be exchanged for an outboard motor.

I am not sure the majority of Paradox owners store their spars within the hull.  It seems practical to store them as on Petite Lady - thats above the cabin while on her road trailer.  Then there's no reason for a hatch, unless one wants additional ventilation.

In actual fact the rudder could be mounted on the extrem edge of the transom taking the line of the transom.  I agree with you here about the linkage. It would need to be worked out and that was part of the reason for my question.

I'm  surprised at this, because VectaVane is obviously one of the better gears suited to smaller boats.  Not only are they lighter than other windvane systems, but they are cheaper!

That may be for short periods and when the wind and sea are stable, but not otherwise - according the accounts I have read.  A windvane or an autohelm will do a more reliable job.

I belive some of that time was spent while hoven-to.


I am still of the opinion that there could be great benefit to those who use Paradox as a coastal cruiser by using a suitable windvane system.  It's a matter of sorting out how it can be done.

Sven seems to have worked out a system with his 'special' rudder setup.  Perhaps that's the answer for Paradox?

Cheers,
Bill.
