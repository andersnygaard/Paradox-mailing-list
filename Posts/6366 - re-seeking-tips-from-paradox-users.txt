Subject: Re: Seeking Tips from Paradox users

Hi all,

I read many of the articles concerning the Paradox. One subject has not been mentioned (as best I recall) The yulloh. I propose having the last 50 cm made of some elastic material so as to better copy fishtailing. It would effectively use the whole extent of each stroke. I have yet to find the right stuff, but how about it? G i l

It might work, but you would be making an entirely different beast to 
the Paradox yuloh. If the Paradox used a slalom stroke it might be 
considered an evolutionary change. As designed it uses a falling leaf 
stroke so the blade has to behave more like a wing. Flexible wings 
are not, generally, a good thing.
