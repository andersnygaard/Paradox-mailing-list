Lots of great info,

With the proper tools and jigs I'm sure it's "fun". Creating the jigs is an art in itself. Taper cutting has long been a task I consider fun and challenging. And as Bill has stated, irrigation pipe is the fast, cheap, strong alternative. Lots of ways to arrive at the same destination.

Thanks for the input!
