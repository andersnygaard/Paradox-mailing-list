Subject: Re: The Classic Paradox Boat "Zoe" Destroyed in Transport

I've only just seen this news. Holy Crap! No way! While I was building Small Fry I must have looked at Zoe pics a thousand times helping me to think through the process ahead, or just to get some inspiration when my motivation was at a low level. Zoe was the vision which helped make sense of very many hours doing sometimes tedious jobs on bits of wood which would one day result in a new Paradox. I can't believe she's gone... that really really really really really really really sux!
