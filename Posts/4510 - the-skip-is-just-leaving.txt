Well, I've not been idle. Completely cleared the garage and put contents amassed over 20-odd years into a 8 cu. metre skip. Ordered ply and Douglas Fir from Robbins in the end - the most expensive quote of the lot but the quality is dependable. Thanks for the tips on quality, Nels.

Guess first job is to start making jigs for laminating the beams while we wait for wood to arrive. Getting quite excited.
