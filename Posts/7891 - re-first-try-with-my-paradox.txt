Hi,

On one of my first trips out I had exactly the same problem with getting the topping lift and the sheet wrapped up with the sail. And, of course, it happened when I had gone out in wind that was really too strong. It resulted in my being knocked down, with water coming in where the hatch was not quite shut. The boat shrugged it off however and carried on as if nothing had happened.

Sean has covered most of the things to watch out for to prevent it happening again. Have the topping lift tight and make sure the fitting on the end of the boom can swivel freely.

One mod I made, after my knock-down, apart from spacing the tang out from the end of the boom, was to put the join in the topping lift as high as possible so the pull on the end of the boom was as vertical as possible.

I have never had that problem again.

Interestingly my knock-down gave me great confidence in the boat. Even though I got things wrong the boat looked after me. I am certain if I had behaved the same with a conventional open dinghy I would have taken a serious swim and possibly lost the boat, as It was I got my sleeve wet.
