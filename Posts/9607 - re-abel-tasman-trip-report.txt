Dear Paradox Sailboat Group,

I wanted to clarify my previous post. When I mentioned the effects of sail tracks, I did not mean to say that they have no effect at all. Rather, I meant to convey that their effect is minimal. Just to be clear, I will not be removing them from my boat in response to anyone's request. However, I personally would not bother adding them to any new boat build of a different type.

Thank you for understanding.

Best regards,

[Your Name]
