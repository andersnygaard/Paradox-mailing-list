Subject: Re: Another UK Paradox!

Hello all,
Thought it was time I came out of the North London woodwork! Yes, 
another UK bloke wants to build this fine little craft.

I have the much-fingered plans; I have spent many hours absorbing your 
messages and gained much useful info, for which many thanks; I have a 
garage filled to the brim with junk; I have a shed filled to the brim 
with junk, I have tools. Wifey expects construction of a glass cabinet 
for her china to commence shortly - what better time then but to start 
immediately on building a Paradox? 

We are gathering quotes on plywood as I write. (I may have to buy 
sapele faced ply in order to pretend it's for her furniture...)

Expect the usual 'what does this mean' questions...
Yours, rather excitedly on finally making a start,
Ian L.


Well, that's really great. I'm the nearest if you want to have a 
look at a Paradox. Friday 8th June may be the launch date, but 
you'll be welcome any time when I'm at home.

Cheers,
Bill.
