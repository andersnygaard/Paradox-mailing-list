Hiya Al,

Still building... had to take a job recently as a burger flipper in a local cafe to be able to finish my boat... who woulda thought retirement would be so expensive? Only have one day a week to build now... oh well.

I have a question about "parking" a paradox. I brought up heaving to in one in a previous post and was giving the answer that it could be done by raising the rudder and sheeting in the main just as you have stated. My question is does this park the boat like the Pardys are talking about? Will it create a "water slick" before the oncoming waves thus creating a calming effect on the water? Or does the boat simply head to the wind and slow to a stop before slowly turning again? I have searched the net using keywords like "heaving to with a lug rig" and have not found an answer to this.

Thanks for your time,
Rod Cannon

Except that it couldn't be all that small. The boom overlaps the 
transom by quite a lot, so trimming this down to make room for a mast 
will reduce the main by a considerable amount.

With the existing rig Paradox may also be "parked" by simply sheeting 
in tight and raising the rudder.

Hoping for calm nights
