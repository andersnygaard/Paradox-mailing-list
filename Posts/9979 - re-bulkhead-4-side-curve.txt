Hi Erik,

I checked my cad drawings and I have no curvature on the outside of bulkhead 4.
I don't know if I understood the second question, but if you mean the radii of the cutouts, I think that you can be creative.
I will close bulkhead 1 and 4 and install hatches to add buoyancy.

Best regards,
Andreas
