Great ideas! I added that link to the File along with an illustration
of what is called a "Wileyport" named after the inventor.

I have one of those on the forward end of the cabin aft and well above
of the free flooding bow well. It consists of a rectangular opening
covered with insect screening. and two brackets inside that allow a
lexan window to be placed either vertically against the opening or on
an angle with the top open for airflow and yet protecting water from
splashing inside. It has two wedges that secure it with friction when
open.

There is also one installed at the stern ahead of the free-flooding
well in my Micro. Both are usually left open for air circulation even
when the winter cover is installed.

Bolger uses these a lot in his designs.
