Looking at the chine runners, and this would be my next step after bottom goes on.

Would it be better to finish the hull and glass it to seal it, then apply the chine runners to the sealed hull, like sacrificial rub rails, so that if by chance they get damaged that the hull bottom is seperate and will not allow water to wick into the hull bottom they could be epoxied on, then a light FG taping?
