Hi David and hi all.

Sorry about my prolonged absence, which i put down to three things:

1.  work,
2.  no money
3.  moving house

moving pretty far so it has taken sometime to get the computer up and running and the workshop rebuilt. Previously my workshop was a fair way from my place, but now i have space underneath the new house to build my boat.

Have just bought the remaining timber, epoxy and glass to finish her and will start (for the second time) hopefully next weekend... 

Just a few points - I intend on putting two clear deckplates on each side of the vent trunk (same as the water tank/transom plates), and flyscreens on the transom vent, deck vent and on the main hatch - I hate mosquitos, no-see-ums etc. ... any bug...

Anyhoo, glad to be back, I'll give you an update and maybe a photo to my progress. (currently, "Walden" consists of bulkheads, and scarfed panels)
