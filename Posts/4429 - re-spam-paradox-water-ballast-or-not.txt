Al, if your problem is the same as mine was, not being able to get the lids tight enough or once tight enough not being able to remove them, I solved the problem by making a tool out of a 10 inch 1 X 2 with 5/8" dowel rods about 2" long set into the 1X at the correct distance apart to fit into the finger holes in the plates. Now I have no problem tightening or loosening them.

Hi all,

I had Little Jim out last weekend (F5-6, quite exciting) and noticed that the bottom of the main locker got a bit damp. I have traced this to a failure of the screw-in inspection cover of one of the ballast tanks. I have continually had trouble with these leaking, and had tried replacing the other one only a month ago with limited success. So I have decided to abandon the water ballast and fit permanent lead ballast instead. I will leave 10kg as water ballast, in 2 litre bottles, so that I can fine tune the trim.

Hoping for calm nights

Al,
