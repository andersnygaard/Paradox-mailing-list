Subject: Re: Paradox tacking difficulties

Hi Jim,

That's exactly what I tried to refer to - maybe you need to move center of effort, or sail towards aft, to create more weather helm? (Some chinese junk rigged boat have their forward most mast tilted forward, to be able to move center of effort of the sail back, for tacking.)

You say the head of the sail is not significantly shorter, which is true, but the sail is also tilted forward. So when reefing - you furl away the lower part which is placed more aft, and keep up the part that is more forward; creating so more lee helm, which doesn't help tacking. Maybe, due to large rudder, the lee helm is not noticable in normal sailing conditions, but comes up when heavily reefed (a bit MORE lee helm) and needed to tack.

That would also make sense why Petite Lady's aft part of the chine runners were cut off.

The subject interests me, because there is another paradox about to get to stage of forming chine runners; and I consider whether these should be moved a bit more forward...

Eerik
