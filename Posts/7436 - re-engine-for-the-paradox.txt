Subject: Re: Engine for the Paradox


I use a 2.3 hp Honda and find it more than enough. The lighter the engine the better as extra weight aft is not desirable.

The problem is mounting it so that the mainsheet doen't get caught up when you tack or gybe.
I've altered the lead of the mainsheet so that it goes through the aft deck instead of the transom but it still can get tangled around the engine if I don't pay attention , as Alastair can attest.

Best
