It is nice to see someone building small boats and I wish Mukti all the best in his venture. Unfortunately he is up against a number of other boats which are not incredibly different and can be bought used for a tenth the price. Even these can be difficult to sell. I predict a lot of boats will soon be on the market after the summer we have had in the UK.

Cheers
