Hi Folks,

I sent the payment out today, cant wait to get started. My name is Jack, and Im from Rhode Island USA  I am a carpenter/tradesman boat builder mr fix it type person. heres a link to my web site, http://members.cox.net/alex29 real simple but there are a few pics of my boat I built in 6 weeks. I use it for diving locally but dream of cruising also but dont want a production boat and do not want a large boat. Paradox seems to fit the bill, and if not alot of fun just the same. not looking to cross oceans just scoot along the coast.
