I have to agree, That tack strop looks like a work of art Steve.
Are you making them to order yet?
Put me down for one :-)

Nels, the luff tension is maintained by the tension on the furling 
line (once the halyard is belayed). The tack strop only sets the 
height of the boom. Look at the plans, I think Matt says something 
like "make fast to cleat and forget it" 


Installed my fore deck today, and as usual took 10 times longer than 
my estimate! Hope to get the rest of the decking installed tomorrow.
