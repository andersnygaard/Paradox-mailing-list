Subject: Timber (or lumber!)

I was off work, and rang my local timber yard enquiring after Douglas Fir. The guy said no problem, call in and we'll sort you out. So I drove over to the yard (about 8 miles) and of course different guy says, "we don't carry that in stock, but we can order it in in a couple of weeks for you"!

So I returned home empty handed, and decided to order from Robbins in Bristol. I made out a pretty comprehensive list for all the cleats, floor joists, chine, sheer and stem. I asked for a quote for planed timber. When the girl got back to me she quoted =A3450. This was double what I'd estimated myself.

In retrospect I probably don't need planed, and looking at Bill's photos, I'm sure you've just used sawn timber for those parts. As the majority will not be on view, i think planning is throwing money away for nothing. What do others think?

I recaculated the cost with just sawn timber, and I can cut most parts myself out of three 2.5 metre boards, and it works out at about =A3150 for the same wood. That's an appreciable difference (to my wallet). Anyway I'll have to wait till Tuesday now to order anything so i can ponder over the weekend about what to do.

As for Progress on "JoHanna" I now have 2 deck beams finished and a third is "cooking" in the kitchen to keep it warm, as I type. Should have all 7 finished by Wednesday. I have marked out the rudder blades tonight and first thing tommorrow I will have the 2 rear side panels, Bulkhead 3, 2 rudder blades to cut out.

Without the interior joinery bits, I may grind to a halt quicker than i thought! I may have go at scarfing a bit of scrap ply together before I try it for real on my side panels. This fills me with fear and trepidation and I'll probably need a week just to do one panel! We'll have to see how it turns out.!

More later
