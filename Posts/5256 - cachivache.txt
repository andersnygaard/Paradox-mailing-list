Thanks to the valuable collaboration of the group he started the construction of the "CACHIVACHE" (The southern most Paradox in the world) To avoid surprises, (Patagonian sea is bravo), he reinforced panels with angle iron and stainless steel bolts In addition he laminated panels on both sides with fiberglass. In a few days add in the folder "CACHIVACHE" the first images. 

Thank you all.
