Subject: Re: Mainsheet and outboard

Hi Jeff,

Thanks for the help - that's much as I was thinking but a lot better drawn.
It has also made me think that I could have the rear mooring cleats welded onto the horse.

I don't understand the reference to the mainsheet angle (technical bit!) Is that very important that it should be the same and where is it measured?

I did also think I might run the mainsheet in through the top of the rear deck above the tiller baffle so any surplus water coming off the sheet can run right back out again. Is that a good idea, or not?

Cheers,
Derek
