Subject: Paradox or Canal Boat?
To: paradoxbuilders@yahoogroups.com

I extended the cabin/berth to be ~12 feet long, this makes the boat ~21 feet long. Since I extended the image without keeping a curvature to the hull in the center, it looks more like a canal boat.

My goal in this exercise is simply to carry more people and maybe a bit more cargo.

Tell me why this wouldn't work, or maybe tell me how it could!

Thoughts? Comments? Flames?
