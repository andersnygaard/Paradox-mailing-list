I meant to mention that if it has reasonably straight grain and tight knots it could work - especially if you make them a bit larger.

You could always make a test joint and test for strength, but it is hard to judge that way - just how stiff the joint will be - against flexing over the length of the boat. Matt says to avoid oak, teak, maple, birch and poplar, either because of poor gluing qualities or poor rot resistance.
