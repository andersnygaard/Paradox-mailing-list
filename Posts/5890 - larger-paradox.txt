Subject: larger paradox

Of course dry weight is less than actual displacement....as displacement assumes crew, stores, water ballast etc.

Anyone know what the estimated dry weight of Paradox is when built per plan (displacement of 1410 lb) vrs. the larger version (displacement of 2321 lbs)

This would give a better idea of tow ability.
