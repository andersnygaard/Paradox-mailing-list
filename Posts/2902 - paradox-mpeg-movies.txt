Hi All,

I have a new mpeg movie but the group does not have room here for me to upload it. So I posted it on my website.

Go to the photo section and the torrent file is there. Also, if anybody would like to serve it, that's fine with me too.

Here's the info on the mpeg,

We are heading south out of Narragansett bay for the ocean, motoring. 2 adults. A powerboat comes close, this happens a lot to us and we wanted to get a movie of one to show how well this boat handles this situation. we take the wake from the side. The bridge is the Jamestown Verranzano bridge, west passage, Narragansett bay Rhode Island.
