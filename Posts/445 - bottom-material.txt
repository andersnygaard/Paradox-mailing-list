I was cruising the local home depot this weekend and noticed that pressure treated wood is around twice as heavy as untreated.

Any thought on making the bottom and possibly the chine logs out of pressure treated on the Paradox? The chine runners would also be good candidates.

Seems like it would put additional weight were it would do the most good and also limit future rot possibilities.
