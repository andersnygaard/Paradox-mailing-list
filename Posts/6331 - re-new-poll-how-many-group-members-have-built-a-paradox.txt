Subject: Re: new poll - How many group members have built a Paradox?

Hi Bruce!

I voted in your poll. I have not bought the plans yet, but I have downloaded lots of stuff since before the passing of the late Don Elliott.

here is something I did which some of you might like to do. I enlarged Don's drawing of Paradox (the one showing tha guy seated and interior arrangement) to 11x17 and framed it. if your printer cannot print that large, print 8.5x11 and take it to a copy center and enlarge it to 11x17  That's what I did. I like how it turned out and now I intend to do another and water color it.

Andrew

I think it would be interesting to know how many of you have built the Paradox already, so I started a new poll "How many group members have built a Paradox?" 

I joined this group about a year ago, and bought the plans in March'09. I can't help being obsessed about this design, and I have built two models so far, using just paper, scissors, and scotch tape. (I printed the plywood layouts from plan #6, and cut them out, then taped them together). I've read many of the prior messages and obtained Don Elliot's booklet, both the PDF from his widow, and the hard copy from MAIB. Even though I think I'll build a 16' outrigger sailing canoe first, I plan on making the Paradox after that.
