Dave, 

I appreciate the pictures.

Note the little end plate on the rudder cheek plate.  It can only be on the port side since the swing up rudder is on the other side.  Interesting little feature.  I thought is was just the light but I enlarged the picture and am fairly sure it is a plate. johninbastrop

Paradox has a similar feature, it is a step for reboarding after going for a swim

Hoping for calm nights
