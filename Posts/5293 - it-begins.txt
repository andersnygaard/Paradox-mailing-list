Subject: It begins

Well, I can't control the urge to get out on the water sooo.. today I begin to build my Paradox almost 3 months ahead of schedule.  I'm going shopping for materials.  I'm a little confused about the epoxy, as system three has changed the way they do things.  I downloaded "The epoxy Book" from them.  I'm confused as to what to buy from them.  I assume I need their general epoxy and hardeners but it gets a little difficult after that.  Gonna have to do more reading on this.

I have decided I can't wait till next year.. I'm gonna be on the water before the new year!
Wish me Luck,
Rod
