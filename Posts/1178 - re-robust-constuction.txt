Phew..... much as I would like to think that was a description of me 
I am afraid it is not. I did *just want to sail* with the proviso that I 
could sail distances while staying warm and dry (a hang over from 
my motor boating years). I had been looking for a number of years, 
then saw Paradox and said "that's it". I had little desire to deviate 
in any way from the plans.

The one modification I would make if I were building again would be 
to the roof. If the whole roof could be removed (concertina; rollover 
like a desktop; soft top?) then a second seat could be mounted 
forward and two people could sit with their heads outside. The 
sleeping problem can be fairly easily overcome, but it is a bit of a 
nuisance, when two up, that one person must stay below.

As designed the Paradox rudder has nothing to stop it swinging 
forward until it hits the bottom of the transom. If you want to use a 
bungee downhaul then you will have to build in a stop of some sort. 
Presumably once the bungee is no longer pulling down the rudder 
would not need any help as it would just float up.

I still prefer the KISS principle.

Hoping for calm nights
