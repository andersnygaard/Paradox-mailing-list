Subject: Bulkhead question
Date: Thu, 20 Dec 2001 17:20:56 -0000

This may seem like a silly question, but it is causing me a bit of confusion. Do the floor members which attach to the bottom of the bulkheads (forward or aft) require the same side and bottom bevels as do the bulkheads themselves?
 
It is not quite clear to me and any clarification would be greatly appreciated. Thanks,
