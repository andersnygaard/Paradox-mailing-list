Subject: Re: Engine for the Paradox

Yes - I realize Paradox is not like a canoe or kayak. My intention was to suggest, there are alternatives to just brute power in order to make progress.

I have a 5 HP Honda 4-stroke and seems to me too big and heavy for a Paradox but each person has to decide for themselves depending on their personal sailing area. No right or wrong intended. My Honda has the Optional 3 amp charging system
