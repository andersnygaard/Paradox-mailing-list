Subject: Sailmaking-Leach detail

When I was making Little Cruiser's sail several years ago, Matt sent me a drawing to show how he makes his leach tablings. I thought this picture might be helpful since it's hard to visualize exactly what is going on solely by his descriptions of the process. Of course, the exact dimensions are slightly different from what he recommends for Paradox. You can see this illustration in the files section under the "New Sail Plan" folder.
