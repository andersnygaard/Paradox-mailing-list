Subject: where to get inexpensive plexiglass or Lexan

One of the many things I admire about Paradox is the great lighting and visibility from the steering station. I'd like to incorporate plenty of light in the design I'm working on, but buying large amounts of plexiglass from a store like West or BoatUs is very expensive. Does anyone know a cheaper source for glazing material?
