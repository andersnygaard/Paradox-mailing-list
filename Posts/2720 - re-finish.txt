Subject: Re: Finish

Perhaps this is not a matter of aesthetics but instead a natural progression from not doing the groundwork correctly in the first place. It becomes easier to just cover up the underlying surface with more paint rather than scrape it all off and re-do it correctly.

This is why I believe taking the time to do it correctly at the beginning pays a lot of dividends later on - meaning less messy work and more sailing enjoyment. 

The interesting thing about water is that once it gains egress, even in tiny tiny amounts it seems to be almost impossible to keep out but if it is kept out in the first place it stays out for a long time. Then the only other major factor is sun damage.

The glass and epoxy is mostly just a matrix to prevent water from getting into the wood. It substitutes for several layers of paint and sealer. If one does not finish it properly then you would have been just as well off to not bother with it in the first place.
