Hi All,

   I'm trying to determine the water line for Bottom Painting, I'm doing ok except for the transom, it does not show water line on the prints. Am I missing something? Do I put Bottom paint up to the line on the prints? 

David

WEST CCP (CoPolymer Plus) I have used this paint since it came out and have always been pleased with it. It is great for the waters I sail in and can be taken out of the water with out affecting it's usefulness. I use it on my catamaran as well, which sits in the water year round and I can get 18 to 24 months between haulouts.
