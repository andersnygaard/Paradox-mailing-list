Hello

Mark, just the allergy go away by itself. Had only one cream against itchiness without cortisone. Did 10 times as a rash, according to the 8 times it was becoming weaker

Andre, I have increased by 20% in plan everything (length, width, height) only material thickness I have changed according to my discretion. The insulation I have on 50mm increased. All bulkheads are on plan position (+20%).

if you would like more data, I write it in here at times.
