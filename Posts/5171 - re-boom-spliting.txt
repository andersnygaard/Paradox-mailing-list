Subject: Re: Boom spliting

I drilled a larger hole, filled it with epoxy/fibres and then drilled and tapped for the bolt I was using (8mm). No problems so far.

I would agree with Andrew's comment about rounding the end off, I ended up fitting a 10mm spacer to get the same effect.

In my recent trip with Bill I was impressed by how much the boom and yard bent when sailing hard.

Hoping for calm nights
