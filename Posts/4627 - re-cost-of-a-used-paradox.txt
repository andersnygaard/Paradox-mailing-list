Subject: Re: Cost of a Used Paradox?

Jeri,

Considering that the materials run about $2,500.00 and the labor is rather intensive and lengthy, one might consider the value in accordance with what one would pay a professional to build the same boat. Depending upon the quality of work and the current condition of the boat that might affect the value considerably. The fact that the Paradox is not a production boat and is rare to begin with, one could expect the price to reflect the availability. The bottom line is that any boat is worth what someone is willing to pay for it, or what the owner is willing to sell it for.
