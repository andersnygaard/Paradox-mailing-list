Hi Don,

Thanks for the info. Here are my thoughts:

1. I'll move the butt of Blkd #2 back to 100mm off the centerline as Matt indicated.

2. I'll double check the layout of the side panel. If there's not enough clearance for the transom, I'll either rotate the panel or swap the transom and bulkhead section.

3. I'll buy an extra half sheet to make the rudder cheeks.

4. I'll mark the side panels to avoid confusion during assembly.

5. Thanks for your offer to give tips on finishing the end bits. I'll definitely take you up on that once the hull is done.

Take care,

Al
