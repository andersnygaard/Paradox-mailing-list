You didn't miss anything Dave, I just don't trust electronics (I'm a retired electronics tech) for example the brand new Autohelm only lasted three days on the trip across the Atlantic with Chris. I normally carry at least two auto pilots on my tri and would have a vane on it but mutihulls accelerate to fast for wind vanes to keep up. (as speed increases apparent wind moves forward) I love the simplistic approach of a wind vane and the fact that it doesn't draw any current.
