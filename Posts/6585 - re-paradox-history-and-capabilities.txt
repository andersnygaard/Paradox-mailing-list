Subject: Re: Paradox history and capabilities

Got it, Paradox was designed for coastal cruising but has some respectable open-water capabilities.  After some reflection, I believe I would have more than my fill of adventure "merely" coastal cruising. It is comforting to know a boat can take a beating if necessary.  The consideration that concerns me now is construction time. At 59 years old I'm hesitant to start a 5-year project e.g. Wee Seal (I spend forever over analyzing every aspect of a project). The Paradox looks to be about 1-year of work, more or less.  The ability to trailer and beach the Paradox is extremely attractive.  Hey Al, thank you very much for your advice.
