Graeme,
I watched Matt apply the "Illusion" letters to the transom at the park. Standing there watching him, It reminded me of one of Don's cartoons. This kind of boat was Don's love and would have been pleased with the reality.

Elusion: clever escape; evasion; the act of eluding.

Mr Don Elliot's unfinished last small boat scheme: "Illusion".

Wished well: Wanda
