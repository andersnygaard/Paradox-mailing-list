Subject: Re: Sail rigging

This is the dogs breakfast at the top of the other mast I own
Each Block is staggered to miss the others when the sail is fully up
There are throat and peak haulyards here

It's awful looking, but it does NOT bind
An earlier rig of this mast had me stuck inbound to the marina with the sail locked fast UP
I threw the anchor out to slow my approach 
(I nearly collided with a big expensive cruiser)
Then scrambled like a monkey on a slippery pole up the mast and hung from the sail till it furled.

It must have been hilarious for onlookers 
I was bruised and sore and more than a bit embarrassed

The blocks had bound the ropes with pressure
The sail was laced too tight
Now she sails as planned
And it's easy to raise, lower and trim

Good luck with yours,
Nick Bell
