A stripped out Paradox without ballast or water should be 550 to 650 lbs. A little heavy for the roof of a car. Actually, I'd say that Enigma is a little heavy as well. I'd say the limit should be 75 - 80 lbs, a little more perhaps if it is two boats. I regularly carry close to that amount in two kayaks. Two boats, each about 40 lbs is easy to lift up but one boat of 80 lbs or more is a bit of a job. The more difficult the loading and unloading the less likely you are to go boating.

A lot of roof racks have load limits of around 120-150 pounds especially for vehicles without rain gutters.

A long narrow boat is a lot easier to load than a short wide one. I have a 17-foot royalex canoe that weighs 72 lb and has a portage yoke amidships. So I can carry it up to the side of the vehicle and rest the bow on the forward rack, then get out from under the yoke and pick up the stern and swing it over onto the rear rack. I also have a 16 ft. kevlar canoe that weighs 45 lb and that one gets about 100 times more use. 

An added advantage is that a person can carry a pack at the same time when portaging the lighter one. The advantage of the heavier one is - you might be able to run the rapids instead of portaging.
