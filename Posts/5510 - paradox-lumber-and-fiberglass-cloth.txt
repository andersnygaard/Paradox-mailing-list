Subject: Paradox lumber and fiberglass cloth

Anyone have a list of the non plywood lumber, and the amount of fiberglass cloth needed to complete paradox. I cannot start building for a few months because of a recent surgery but want to get everything together and also put more thought into whether the stock size paradox will be large enough for me.
