Thanks Alan

My ideas include something sliding under the roll top so that if I am in rougher weather with 
the likelihood of a wave dumping on me there will be support for the fabric. I was thinking 
either ply or polycarbonate.
Comments by Jim Hall, however, regarding being able to sit on the seat with the top closed 
have set me thinking again.
