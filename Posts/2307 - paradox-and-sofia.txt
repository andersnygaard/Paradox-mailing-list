Subject: Paradox and Sofia

Fall is usually the time I start dreaming of boats and which one to start building in winter. This is usually a kayak, so I figure any real boat I build may well end up being a two year project. 

I put some additional files into Paul's Files showing Paradox side by side with Sofia, designed by Rolf Eliasson and Christer Lundberg, evolved from Sven Yrvind's Bris boats. 

So, I am trying to figure out which to build. I hope this isn't off topic, if so let me know and I'll remove the files. After seeing Jack's Paradox, I was surprised at how small it was, as I was hoping it would fit my wife and I. Of course I haven't seen a later Bris boat, so I don't know how roomy they are for two people either. I assume the bow centerboard in Sofia would still take up quite a bit of room. The hull is supposed to be two inch thick divinycell, but as I have no plans of crossing an ocean, I may opt for half inch foam, and conventional fiberglass.

But as I haven't built anything other than a kayak, a Paradox may be better as the construction is much simpler, full plans exist, and I could always leave the wife behind.

Anyone have any suggestions.

Paul
