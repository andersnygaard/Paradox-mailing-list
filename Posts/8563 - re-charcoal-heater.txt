Yeah ... Sorry. Not a Paradox but the same heater idea should work for it since it is similar in size to a Paradox main cabin.

I hadn't thought of the stove pipe catching on anything. I won't know until I actually get this thing out on the water.

The picture was a little hard to make out exactly the shape so here's another one.

The pipe doesn't go past the side deck so it MIGHT be OK.
