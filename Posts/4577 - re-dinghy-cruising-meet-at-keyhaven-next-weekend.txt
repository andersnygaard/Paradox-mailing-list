Subject: Re: Dinghy Cruising Meet at Keyhaven next weekend

Hi,

I don't know about Bill, but he is, at this moment, making his way from Exmouth to Essex so I don't expect he will be coming back again next weekend. We have just completed a fortnight of not sailing to Scilly (a long story), so my boating freedom has now been reduced till i work off some family commitments. My next outing will probably be the Cobnor week (Aug 18th)

P.S. Isn't it Paradoxen?

Hoping for calm nights

Al,
Yeovil, England.
