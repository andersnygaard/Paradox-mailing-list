Subject: Re: How heavy is a fully loaded and ballasted Paradox?

I wonder if he will be able to take some shortcuts through shallow water??

Incidentally, Matt has entered Paradox in the WaterTribe Everglades Challenge 2003 Fort Desoto to Key Largo ~260 miles. He is registered in class 4/open/experimental class. It should be interesting to see how he does. You can read more about this event as well as the competitors at http://www.watertribe.com/FloridaEverglades/.

Hoping to be sailing soon !!!   Dave
