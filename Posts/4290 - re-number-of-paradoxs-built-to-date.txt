David,
   
Ah Hah!  Elvis country!  My days off are on Friday and Saturday, when would be a good time for you to let me see your boat?  We live about a two hour drive from both Mobile Bay and Pensacola Bay.  All we have locally is a very narrow river with tall trees on each side. I'd be glad to have you come to my house, or I would be glad to drive to Tupelo to get a good look at your boat.  What works best for you?
