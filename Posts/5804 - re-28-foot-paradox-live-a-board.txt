Subject: Re: 28 FOOT PARADOX LIVE A BOARD

It's going to work just fine. Confidence and some boldness are needed. I once got a book from the library on naval archetecture. In the first chapter first sentance it said this. "Boats are generally boat shaped. They may vary from place to place because of local conditions and intended use. Have a look around at the boats in your part of the world and see what has worked well in the past."
Many nice boats were designed by eye only, and by unschooled men too.
You may adjust the ballast to correct any trouble after you have some time in her. If you can build a boat you can fix anything wrong with it. Your boat will be unique and whatever performance you get will be what the next builder will compare too. The length to width ratio at 3 1/2 to 1 is sweet and slippery. It will be fine. Buck up! no need for butterflys.
