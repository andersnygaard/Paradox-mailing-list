Hi Rob

Yes the Paradox is very sturdy which is re-assuring when you're bouncing along a gravel bottom ...
Also the weight improves the comfort level - a heavy displacement gives you a nice steady ride in rough conditions 
And you can keep on adding to the inventory aboard without killing the performance.

Best
Jim
