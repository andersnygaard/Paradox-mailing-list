Subject: Re: The Unreachables

Me again.. I have written to a few boat building micro cruiser groups.. I am trying to reach Dave and Mindy Bolduc, their contact email address  in the contact section of microcruising.com, being: mbolduc@triad.rr.com sends me to timewarner cable, whatever that is. I am no techguru so I don't know why this happens.

Your query has been answered several times!
mbolduc@triad.rr.com is an email address just like surfgarden@yahoo.com is!
Notice the @ separating the username and the domain name?
It might just be a clue.
Use it as such and miracles will happen.
Dave is currently cruising the Bahamas in Enigma and so you may have to wait for a reply.
If you're finding this hard, wait until you try and understand sheet #12 of the plans...
