Today I was wondering what a 16 inch propeller might look like on the tiny transome of a paradox. I hung the 16 inch diameter prop from a rope on the transome to see the general proportions involved. I fill in the missing "Frankenstein-outboard-motor" which will hold the propeller, with imagination. I took pictures and posted them under Ironsides photos

Not for shallow water usage, then. What would you do with it when it is stowed?

I see you have left off the boarding step from the rudder. Why did you do that? I find the step very usefull when setting off from a beach.
