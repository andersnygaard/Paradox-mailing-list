Subject: Re: Living ability for 2

The Paradox will carry 2 without any problem but in the standard form the second person has to be down below, which is not good on a nice summer day.

I have given some thought to this and my best solution would be to replace the plywood cabin roof, and hatch, with canvas. Then, with the roof removed a second seat could be inserted at bulkhead 3 so that the crew would sit in front of the skipper.

This would, of course, reduce the ultimate seaworthiness, but it would still probably be safer than any open dinghy.
