No postings for days 'n days! Did I fall off or is there a building frenzy going on?

Couple of minor items:

My neighbor had a pet cockatoo, which keeled over in the cage. He took it to the vet, the vet took a brief look at the bird and said, "It's dead."

The neighbor said he'd like a second opinion, so the vet called in his pet siamese. The cat took a look, pawed the bird once and said, "Yep. Bird's dead, allright."

The neighbor said "I just can't accept the opinion of a stupid feline," so the vet called his labrador retriever. The dog walked over, sniffed around the bird carefully, licked its wings and tail feathers, sat down and said, "That, sirs, is one dead bird."

The neighbor finally gave up and asked for the bill. The vet handed him an invoice for $328.00. The neighbor screamed in surprise and asked why the bill was so high. Vet said, "$8.00 for my opinion, $320.00 for the cat scan and lab report."

I also came across "Jamestown Distributors" and in case I'm not the last to know here it is:

I've been snooping around the woodenboat forum, and there's heaps of people there with great ideas and help about building boats. One of the things I discovered is that lots of people say favorable things about some of those cheap "off brand" epoxies like from Raka (www.raka.com) and Fiberglass Epoxy Products (http://www.epoxyproducts.com/marine.html). Considering the price differential, that's very reassuring information to me!

If you're all snoozing, sorry to wake you up :)
