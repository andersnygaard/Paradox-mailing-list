Hi Jeff,

Yes I'll be building at home. I'm currently fabricating in the garage, but when the time comes the full assembly will be done in my Car port which is currently enclosed on three sides but which I intend to fully enclose in the next few months. This should give me a reasonable dry area, although it may not be particularly warm.
