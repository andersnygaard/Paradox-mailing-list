Many paint stores have a device that can scan and match any color you bring to them; therefore, they should have no trouble making up a batch of your "Photoshop Special Green." 

As for the use of house paints, I prefer the oil based ones because I think they are harder and more abrasion resistance. However, many people have had plenty of success using latex ones. Incidentally, for "Little Cruiser" we have always used Red Devil Brand one part polyurethane semi gloss enamel, which is no longer available. Fortunately, we bought up a large stock of it at sale price when it was discontinued. 

I think for your boat, any nice oil based paint will do nicely, and it won't cost you an arm or a leg like a marine version.
