Subject: Re: Top to water ballast tank

You have coated the underside of the top, haven't you?

I put on masses of thickened glue, and then reached in through the access hatches and spread the squeezed-out glue into a fillet with my thumb (inside disposable gloves). That seems to have been quite successful as I have had no leaks there (the inspection hatches on the other hand .......)

Hoping for calm nights
