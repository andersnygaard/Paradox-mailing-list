Hi Al.

That's what I meant by not thinking twice on using brass screws.
That's why I used them on NOLI everywhere as well as glue.
Do you know what type of ply Bill used?
I only laminated three parts on NOLI and they were the top forward part of the coach roof, the front of its windscreen and the hatch top.
The windscreen and the coach roof were made from three layers while the hatch top was made from two laminations of ply
If bronze nails are to be used, why not just fit them just below the waterline and anything above could be brass screws.
Save a bit on dosh.
1 1/4" X 8 brass screws from Screwfix are =A36.26 for 200.

In stainless A2 they work out cheaper, =A35.36 per 200, but I have no experience with using them.

A friend whom worked as a boatbuilder for a company I use to contract draw/illustrate for, built one of their boats, 21 foot, for himself and used the same screws that went into the production boats.
Those screws were simply steel plated. His only concession was to paint the heads with Polyester resin before fitting the rubber rubbing strip.
That was about 28 years ago and they are still in there.
He uses the boat all year round for fishing, and it only comes out for about two weeks for a clean up and bottom paint.
But he did build it stronger than the production boats.
