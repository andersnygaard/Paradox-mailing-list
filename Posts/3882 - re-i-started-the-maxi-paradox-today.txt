Just a thought.
Looking at Matt's video again and using the line of the swell 
rolling in, ENIGMA seems to be sailing at about 45 degree's to the 
wind.
In a cruising boat this is very acceptable. 
There are production cruisers still being made that just achieve 
this.

One can also notice the buildings on shore as reference points. Seems 
he tacks effortlessly while continuing to shoot the video.

What a great little boat!
