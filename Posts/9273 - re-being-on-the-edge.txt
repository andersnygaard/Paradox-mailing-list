Hi Deric,

How coincidental, I've just re-fitted a topping lift this week.

Yes, it can tangle. That's why I removed it a few months ago. I've tried a lift on the tumbler thimble too. If you can keep it from jamming, it works after a fashion. I see one boat has lazyjacks too, I wonder if that's another tangle waiting to happen.

I've re-fitted my boat for this sailing season, including moving the ballast forward, adding a topping lift, re-varnishing the exterior wood, flattening the rudder blade where it contacts the upper rudder, it was a bit wobbly, the blade was too foil shaped on its upper surface. Refitting an under floor water tank and its plumbing.

Placing a locking cleat on deck to hold the anchor line that's made fast to a cleat. I have 30 feet of line on the anchor variously wrapped around fittings on deck so it's always ready. It can be quickly set by releasing the cleat, then the boat should, after the anchor digs in, skew into wind on the anchor and leave the boom more central for complete furling. I've tried it five times at home and all five times, with the topping lift, the sail has furled first time, albeit, as you do, bit by bit. Don't try and do one long pull to furl. I have the topping lift rope end cleated inside near where I sit.

I've grounded mine too, on a shell grit island in an estuary. Pushed it off, climbed on board only to be blown back onto the same island while scrambling aboard (more than once). I finally dragged the boat around so the wind would push me away from the island. It must have looked comical (Mr. Bean goes sailing).
