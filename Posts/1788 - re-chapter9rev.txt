Hi Kjell,

Thanks for the translation revision!
This chapter 9 must be one of the strongest, most convincing and cleverest texts ever written about Paradox.
Sven wonders if we have any questions? Yes! I always wanted to know why Sven decided not to use the chinerunner and heavy displacement paradox concept in his latest project. Now, after reading this chapter, this question just begs for an answer!
The answer is perhaps in the following chapters of the book?
Do you know when an english edition will be available?

Best regards,
Bert.
