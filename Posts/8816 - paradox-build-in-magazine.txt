Subject: Paradox Build in magazine

Hello everyone,

I publish Barnacle Bill Magazine, we are planning to cover a couple of in house builds in 2017 and one of those will be a Paradox. This will be done in a domestic situation in a garage in the UK and there will be no cheating (pros/very expensive tools etc..)
I have a set of plans and have Don's excellent manual from Wanda. The build will either start in January or June - we will also be building a Michalak ScramPram and have to complete a Storer Oz Goose first. 

I would be very interested in corresponding with Paradox sailors and builders form around the world as we do this and also am very interested in gathering opinions and adventures to introduce the design to new potential micro cruising enthusiasts. It would be great if we could publish info on several Paradox's and their owners in different parts of the world, their views on the boat, tips, mods and also comments on handling etc.

One thing I have found in our sector is that boats can go through generational popularity. A group of folk retire and start to build a good design, the design inspires others and more folk build the boat. But then age catches up with us and the knowledge accrued in the build and in the boat design itself can be lost to posterity. Some boats deserve immortality and it is my firm belief that the Paradox is one of those, given its popularity, its clever design and the chine log system. Groups like this and constant enthusiasm for the design ensures immortality. Publishing does as well and as our copy is logged at the British Library as a mater of statutory requirement, it will be preserved for as long as that institution stands.

Please drop me a line if you are interested in taking part.
I will also be on here asking for a lot of help!
cheers

Richard
