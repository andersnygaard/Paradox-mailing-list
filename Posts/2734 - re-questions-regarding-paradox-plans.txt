I'm going through the paradox plans, trying to develop a comprehensive parts list for myself. I'm up to page 7 and I have a backlog of questions that I hope people here can answer for me.:

- The term "P&amp;S" are used throughout the plans; but what does it mean?

port ansd starbord

- How many yards of 38" wide woven roving (three layers on bottom) and 50" 6.0 oz fiberglass matte (one layer everywhere else) to order?  I estimated 28 yards and 20 yards respectively, with plenty of extra scrap.  Enough?  *Way* too much?

I used Biax, so I dont know

- As far as I can tell, the length of the mast, boom and yard are not given in the plans-- Especially if using the new sail that Matt designed.

I used 1 by 4 inch doug fir porch flooring, clear, 16 footers, work in metric it is easier.

- Is a continuous/piano hinge used on stateroom sole hatch, just like the cabin sole hatches,  or standard hinges?

I used piano hinge, your going to be standing on that door.

- How are the shelves mounted (I'm assuming) the bin sides?

- I don't at all understand how the "metal angle" shown on page 5 is to be used, or attached.  Can someone please go into further detail of this?  What length angle to get, and is that 1"x1" angle iron?

I cannot for the life of me remmeber this one.

There seems to be lots of plywood parts listed in the plans that are not shown on the "10 sheets" of plywood.  In other words, am I going to need to buy more plywood to make the following parts:

- 9mm ply for stateroom bin side
- 9mm ply for stateroom "divider"
- 12mm ply for "breast hook" piece
- 12mm ply for two deck scabs
- 12mm ply for vent trunk baffle
- 18mm ply for vent trunk sides/front
- ??mm ply for aft bin dividers (Also, what mm ply is used?)

yea, lots of that are missing, alot of interior is left to the users discretion...

Well that's it for now. Thanks for any help.
Good luck!!!!
