Hi Denny.

NOLI is basically the same size and layout as PARADOX..
The depth of her hull came from me wanting to get each hull side out of a sheet of 1/4" ply. As it was the hull panels and transom came out of two sheets and the bottom 3/8" out of one.

Hi Jeff,
You didn't really get the bottom out of just one sheet did you?
Or was it one of the longer (12'?) sheets?
I've been working on a scaled-down idea, and have managed to get down to 5 (metric) sheets total, including decks and rudder, for what amounts to a fat canoe with a lid. I'm trying for a protected day-sailer rather than a full 'cruiser'.

Cheers,
Alan.
