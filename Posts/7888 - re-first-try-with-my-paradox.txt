Subject: Re: First try with my Paradox

Hi Andre,

The experts are all asleep (I'm in NZ, they're in your part of the world) and I'm about to start my build, so I can't comment directly, but I can see from the plans that the roller furling aspect of Paradox's rig could easily jam, particularly if it isn't built EXACTLY to plan.

The plans don't have a topping lift, yet a lot of people seem to add them. I think that's because you have to be very coordinated to use the rig with only a non-geared halyard and boom furling line.

One thing I've wondered about is placing a block on top of the yard and an attachment point just below the masthead sheave, so that you have a two 2 one purchase rather than the current one 2 one. That would mean you have to release twice as much halyard for the same degree of fall, which might make it easier to lower the yard and furl at the same time.

Has anybody tried that?

Cheers,

Rob.
