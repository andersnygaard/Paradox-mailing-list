Top bloke is Alastair:

Absolutely agreed. Alastair has been sailing his Paradox for about 10 years now, and very actively, so would have more experience than any other member of this group as far as I know. Also an engineer by profession which helps him have a grasp of problems and possible solutions. 

It's pity that his sail is the old type, so different from mine.

I prefer to have just a small hole to pass the rope through than a cut out. Would look neater and it's simpler. With the extra thickness that's been added there, chafe is not a concern.

The problem is knowing exactly where to put the hole. I need someone who uses the new type sail to measure the distance for me....-please.

Best

Jim
