I concur with DC Jeff, I've used some very old epoxy with no problems but have noticed that the resin sometimes crystallizes near the bottom of the can. If this happens, just boil some water and put the can in the pot (off the stove) and stir. The West people did some tests on ten year old epoxy and found that there was no loss of strength but that the hardener made mixing a bit more difficult because it had thickened, as DC mentioned (never tried to heat it up to see if that would thin it any). Heating epoxy reminds me of once when it was very cold and I only needed to glue up a small joint I mixed a small amount and decided to give the mixture a little heat up in the wife's microwave, I set the dial for 15 seconds to see what would happen, big mistake, it exothermed so fast that it almost filled the microwave before I could get it out. Lucky for me the wife was at work.
