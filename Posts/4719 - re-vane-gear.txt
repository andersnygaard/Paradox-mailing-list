Yea, thanks James. I had one of those on my Hunter 19 when it was first produced in the UK by a chap who lived at Highbridge in the West Country. It was known as the QME, made by Quantock Marine Enterprizes. They sold hundreds because they were cheap, but unless your boat was exceptionally well balanced they would not work.

With Paradox, the sail and sheet would snag the vane, unless the whole system could be mounted well astern of the sail. The QME was quite heavy because of the enormous lead weight.

Cheers,
Bill.
