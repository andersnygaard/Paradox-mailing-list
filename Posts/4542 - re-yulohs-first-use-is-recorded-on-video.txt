Noli is coming on well, but my heart goes out to you with this awful spell of wet and windy weather - just what you don't want when sheathing out of doors.  I found I needed a lot of space for doing the external GRP.  I could not have done it within the restriction of my garage.

Your skiff is very attractive and it's a compliment that we have similar colour schemes.
