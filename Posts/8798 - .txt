Subject: The Great Loop

After seriously considering the Great loop in my Paradox I have to agree with Navkram. The only reason for doing it would be bragging rights, and at my age I don't need bragging rights so much anymore. Yes, take the same time and energy to sail the best cruising grounds in North America instead. I have had the privilege to cruise my Paradox in beautiful places like Florida's St-John's river, Ontario's Thousand Islands Park, the Saguenay Fjord and so on, which leaves a person wanting more. Not sure I want to be one of the "fools" and attempt the Great loop grind. Would rather do the Bahamas and the Sea of Cortez. BUT, there is something to be said for the adventure and torture of completing such a challenge. Why do people bake themselves in the Texas 200? Not for pure enjoyment, that's for sure! Suffering is healthy, in some strange way. As a survival expert, I know. Darkness to appreciate daylight.

Cheers!
