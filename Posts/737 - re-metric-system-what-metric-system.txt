Subject: Re: Metric system? what metric system?

I finally found a cm/inch tape measure, a nice Stanley MaxSteel. I had to look at a couple of different places before finding one. "Whaddya want one a them for?" the hardware store clerk said, eyeing me like I was some kind of commie pinko.

Its going to be a little odd working with metric. First of all, all the materials are nominally english system here. I say nominally because due to some strange grading or classification system, a 2"x4" board is actually more like 1-5/8"x3-1/2". Apparently producers are allowed to sell boards minus about a 1/2" inch of what they specificy. Probably the minimum building codes and lumber grading standards allow.

This is not going to be too hard though. I'll take the tape to the lumberyard and measure actual dimensions in cm, and then I can order wood from real dimensions instead of this approximate stuff. Anything in inches is just approximate, in cm is plus or minus 2mm, thats my goal.

2 inch sawn is sawn to about 2 inches. 2 inch planed is sawn to 2 inches and then has some more planed off.

The sizes on paradox are mm values for inch sizes, after all Matt was buying in inches as well.

Most of the wood, as distinct from plywood, can vary in size several mm without making a significant difference to the final construction.
