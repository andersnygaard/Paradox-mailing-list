Subject: Re: Stem Help

Greg,
The stem is actually quite simple as long as you read the correct dimensions off the plan! I made cardboard templates of each station which gives a visual clue of what to aim for as you plane merrily away. I actually really enjoyed making the stem, even if I did make a rather fundamental mistake at the time.
