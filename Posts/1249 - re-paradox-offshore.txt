The two boats are as different as chalk and cheese. 

Paradox is designed for coastal cruising with shallow water 
capability, but also she is sufficiently able to make the occasional 
short off-shore passage.  She is less than 16 ft LOA.

Didi Mini is primarily a 21 ft ocean racer with a huge sail area and 
fixed deep fin keel.

No doubt Paradox would be capable of crossing an ocean, but she was 
not designed for that purpose.

I am posing to an earlier thread because it seemed the best suited. 
I have just spent 
an evening reading and scanning all of the posts on this forum. I 
am very happy to 
have found this group.

I would really like to know the "offshore" capabilities of this 
design. I wonder if 
applying a limited use of kevlar/carbon fiber composites could 
improve the strength 
of 
key componets, ie. mast, rudder fittings. 

I have been considering a Dix Designed Mini Transat 650  
http://www.dixdesign.com/
didimini.htm . It is a fast boat capable of transatlantic 
crossings, but it is a much more 
involved building project and is much more of a single purpose 
design--racer. 
Something about the Paradox just does it for me.

Any ideas or suggestions? I have ordered Don's articles and will 
send for the Paradox 
plans from Dave tomorrow.

Thanks for the bandwidth, Freddie

ps. Does anyone have a Paradox within 200 miles or so of Annapolis, 
MD? Or actually, 
does anyone have one near a city serviced by SouthWest Airlines? I 
would be willing to 
fly out for a weekend to study a Paradox.
