Hello Derek,

For what you are doing that will work just fine. Sounds like great fun.

You might think about building the water tanks as shown except with open hatch lids (oval shaped to maintain some strength), allowing you to store those bladders and other things.

Paradox, you will find, is a very versatile cruiser; it's true, good things do come in small packages.
