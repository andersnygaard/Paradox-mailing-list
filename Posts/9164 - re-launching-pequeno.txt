Hi André-François,
 
I think we were probably sailing at the same time... on opposite sides of the globe! Glad to see another Paradox launched. There's been a few new ones lately and Deric can't be far away getting one of the very first back on the water. Couple of comments below.
 
Cheers,
 
Rob.
 

I’m very pleased with the interior layout. Like in my other Paradox «Iota», I did not install the internal water tanks. Seems to me to be too much trouble filling and refilling these and too much maintenance to my taste.

After building the ballast tanks, I'm inclined to agree. It's just more mucking around with no real benefit. I've started filling them at home and towing with them full. I only empty them before I retrieve and when I'm in a hurry sometimes I don't bother with that either. As designed, the tanks were for the Bahamas, but I don't do that kind of sailing and in NZ there's fresh water everywhere.

I also installed two additional 16 inch square below-the-floor compartments just in front of the two larger ones on the plan. I find that access to these larger ones is a bit inconvenient in that you have to get off the seat to get into them, whereas my two additional ones are immediately accessible. 

This too is a good idea. It is a bit of a hassle getting into those compartments. The biggest hassle of all though is making up the bed and putting it away again with the hatch closed. I have to move so much gear around backwards and forwards from the state-room that I'm ready for that lie-down, despite not being tired beforehand!
