The real answer is, of course, to buy some decent covers, not the 
$2.50 ones from the boat jumble. However they do have an O ring 
so tightening them more than finger tight will probably fix it.

That said, it really isn't a problem. I have a bit of campers sleeping 
mat (for my knees) over that bit of the floor and I have noticed that 
the underside gets wet. A wipe with a sponge fixes it. Far more 
water than that comes in on my feet when I launch from a beach.

As for hours to build, heaven knows. Mine took 18 months of not-
very-hard evening and weekend work. If I were to build another I 
would reckon on 1 year. An experienced builder with all the gear, 
working full time, could probably do it in a couple of months.

Hoping for calm nights
