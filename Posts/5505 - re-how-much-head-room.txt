I love Robbsboat and almost built one instead of the paradox. At one time it came down to which one; black skimmer, robbsboat, or paradox. Black skimmer was x out cause of size and I only chose paradox over robbsboat because of a fluke. I read Don Elliott's story about Matt and became all teary eyed. heh... really it was the fact that I could find more info via the net on the Paradox and felt that as a beginner there was alot of support and people who had built them. Had I more experiance I may have made a diffirent choice.

As an afterthought I am glad I chose Paradox cause I come from Kansas originally and believe you me...... some of us do need to know how to wipe our butts on the ocean!! I mean... there are no corncobs out there, right ..!?!?!!

LOL,
Rod
