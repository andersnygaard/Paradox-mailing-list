go to my side to see a boat i am building in a nne car garage


Hello,

I built Little Jim in my garage (and a UK garage is probably smaller than a US one). I built it on a wheeled dolly so I could push it out for easier access.

My previous experience was an 8 foot pram dinghy about 25 years ago. I think you would have to be very ham fisted to get it wrong, but it is not a quick build. I took 18 months, others have taken several years.

It is a splendid boat for living aboard for weeks, or months, at a time but it is only good for single handing. If you want company on board you would probably be better looking elsewhere.

There is masses of storage on board for one person, I now regularly carry my bicycle simply because the space was there and was not being used.

Hoping for calm nights

Al,        
Yeovil, England.
