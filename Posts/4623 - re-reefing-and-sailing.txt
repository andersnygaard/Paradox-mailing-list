Hi Robert.

My Paradox is not finished yet. I can tell you what I do with my anchor on another tiny boat. I have a plastic bucket which holds the whole anchor kit. Put it where you like. In reading your letter It seems you don't have the plans. Much is given in them which may answer your questions. I thought I read somewhere that Matt holds the haliyard and reef line both at the same time and slips the haliyard out as he pulls hard on the reef line. In this way the boom hovers in mid air while rolling up. Always keeping tension on both. I may be wrong, I have not done it. I want to know if the yuloh works better with more blade area. More thrust maybe? Any way, good luck.
