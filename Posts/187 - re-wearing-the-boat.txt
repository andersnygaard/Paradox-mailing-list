made a mockup of the cabin on Paradox from some spare cardboard boxes and stuff lying around my place. I did this to get an idea of the size/utilisation. Now, I am 6 feet tall and weigh 210 pounds and I found the space fine. 

Good to know.  Some others on other sites have recommended against this boat for me.  I am as tall as you are.. but I have had a couple more servings of pretzels and beer than you.  I don't mind a little tight... and this is my boat to go alone in.   But I do want safe!
