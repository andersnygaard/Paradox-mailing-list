Thanks for that, I hadn't thought of doing it that way. I was locked into the idea of a roller that rolled on both the boat and the ground and had been trying to solve the problem of sinking in soft sand. Just show it is good to stand back from a problem and look at it in a different way.

PS I see Matt isn't home yet, must be close now.

Hi Al,

I have made a very crude sketch of the rollers and it is attached. The rollers are 6 inch long 2=94 diameter boat rollers mounted on trestles made from 2 X stock mounted on 2X4=92s. Matt carried both rollers in the bilge compartment on the starboard side, which is to say they were made to stow in that area. They worked great (He had two sets) and would move one from the stern as the weight went on to the forward one. I think the overall length was about 30 inches and the width about 12 =96 14 inches.

He also had a line attached to each one long enough that he could tie it to a cleat so that it would not drift off in the surf until he could retrieve it.
