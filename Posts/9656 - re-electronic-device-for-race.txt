Okay, I am retracting my offer to donate for the 2021 races or any of the other races I spoke of. I was not trying to throw money around, but I just had a dream of seeing Paradox boats race, and I was hoping that the money might make that happen. There are too many variables that make it not practical or possible. I will work on gaining more knowledge about sailing and these wonderful little boats so that maybe I can figure out how to make this happen in the future.
