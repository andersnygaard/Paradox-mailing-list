Thank you all for your advice. Enjoyed hearing from you.

The towing story was an educational read as well. It will be a winter project to add the u bolt. I am not happy with aligning the bow up of the boat to the trailer with using the cleats. The eyebolt or u bolt will make it easier.

Anyone looking together to sail our paradox near east coast of USA, feel free to write me.

Fairwinds,
