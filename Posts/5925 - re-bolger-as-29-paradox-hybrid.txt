Subject: Re: Bolger as-29 paradox hybrid

Hello to all following this thread. 

I think chine runners wold work well on an AS29, or really any of the Bolger "square boats". I have the plans to the AS29, and 39, plus a few other more obscure Bolger squareboats. They all (with minor deviations) follow the same pattern. The two real differences I see between the Bolger sharpie, and Mat's Paradox is the bow. Bolger prefers a raised bow (out of the water), and Matt's (and many) others sharpie is roughly at the surface. The other is the rocker, the Paradox has the rocker peak aft. 

One thing I don't understand is the differences between the two, other than the well known standard arguments. I suspect they differ in performance only around the edges, being basically the same thing (IE small differences). So, or if so, the Bolger sharpie is close enough it seems to me (completely uninformed) that CR's would work on an AS.  

Now, the real fun would be to see someone do it. From a performance perspective, someone else said possibly the combo of a small CB and CR's works best. Different "tools" to use based on the circumstances. It would be very nice to hear more information from the Hogfish designer, or to see more Bolgeresque sharpies being built.

From a boat purchasing perspective, I might see a squareish very low draft larger boat a few times a year, if that. If one wanted to buy a larger (AS29-39) boat, and wanted shoal draft, your basically limited to a MAC26 or a Hunter Motorsailor.

If a more informed person could better describe the differences between the Bolger and ML sharpies, please do so.
