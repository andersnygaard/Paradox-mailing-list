Setting in the last chine log and filleting in the rear section before closing in the hull bottom, yup, bottom is going on over the next two days. 

When I had her upright I cut out the decking and the upper cockpit, of course im always messing with the original design and thinking how it could be "better suited to my wants needs and desires after reading the plans and researching the various options available to today's fashion minded boatbuilder with today's space aged materials" I would like to extend the cabin forward over the "forward stateroom" and then hop up a step in the rear for the hatch and where the capt sits, bringing him a bit higher to allow just a tad bigger seat and a bit more headroom, still just looking at it and wondering if it can be so..... or the pexiglass dome over the "forward stateroom" ala Nels. However, Nels I know what boat you are thinking about putting it in :) Flame away on reasons to be or not to be...
