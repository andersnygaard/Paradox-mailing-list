Subject: TARDIS for sale

I have the opportunity to go sailing for an extended period of time. I have decided to sell TARDIS rather than have her sit gathering dust while I sail around the world. If anyone is interested in her, give me a call at 832.859.8416. I will be leaving the first week in Jan, but have someone that can show her if she doesn't sell before I leave.
