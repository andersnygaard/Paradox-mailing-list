Collected my Sapele today.
4.45 metres of 250 by 40 mm at =A3105 including VAT.
I also carried away about =A330 worth of free offcuts suitable for turning. Each offcut is a different species.
Lastly, if any UK firemen want to know where the government/Army store their Green Goddesses contact me off group.
