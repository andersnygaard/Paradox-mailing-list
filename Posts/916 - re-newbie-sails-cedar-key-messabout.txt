Usually great sailing. Wind in the morning can be up to 20 knots. Then by 2 pm is nearly calm. Comes up again in evening sometimes. Depends on the prevailing weather. Generally we have great weather. Hope you can make it David. Good news: no fishing turnement this year! I'll be staying at Gulfside Motel. Most of the others are right next door at the Island place, or scattered in the few other hotels or the rv camp outside of town. Most everybody leaves their boats on the Island Place beach at low tide. I'll be sailing a white Seapearl trimaran anchored out by Atsena Otie. Hope we can have two paradoxes!
