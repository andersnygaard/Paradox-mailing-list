I tried the thermarest cushions as well but found they were too 
narrow for my liking and too wide to put two abreast to cover the 
whole cabin sole. With my new cushions I can fill in the entire sole 
and take a nap at will while sailing off shore. They were cut out in 
such a way that one covers the water tanks and two cover the storage 
compartments aft and allow you to put them forward when not needed or 
just lift one to access the compartment below.

I like your idea about covering the inner tube with sunbrella DC, and 
will do mine as well. I have found that often when you get up to move 
the darn thing sticks to your bottom, the cover would prevent that 
and be much more comfortable.
