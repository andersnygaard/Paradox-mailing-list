Matt,
The chine runners on PARADOX should work at any angle of heel as their main job is to stop water breaking away from the sides and going under the hull. It is the action of water running along the hull sides and under the hull that is the main cause of leeway. By fitting the chine runners, they act as a fence, keeping the water running along the hull sides. I would like to see PARADOX and LITTLE CRUISER, with her centerboard raised, sailing together on a reach, just to see how much difference the chine runners make, or has Dave and Matt tried this already?
