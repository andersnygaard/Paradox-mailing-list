Wow that was quick.  I should have added to make notes with references back to the specific sections as you read Don's book.  It is so informationally packed that you will spend a lot of time just trying to refind the details.  You can tell by reading it Don was a great guy.  Hard to not honour his efforts.  Enjoy and build safe.

Cheers Tom
