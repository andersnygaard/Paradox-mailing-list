Hi David

Yep. In the group photos as Enuf.
I've another to add now that the hull is the hull is the right way up and the imperfections 
on her bottom can no longer be seen :0)
It must be understood that any slight kink in a chine runner is down to photographic 
anomalies and not over exuberance in shaping!
