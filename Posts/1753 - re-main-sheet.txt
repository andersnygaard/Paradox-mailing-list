Hi All,

With Paradox There is a problem with the main sheet fouling on the rudder and rear cleats, This problem is compounded with an outboard. I am thinking about adding an arch (sch 40 Brass) to clear all obstructions on the rear deck. Any opinions?

David

Do you know what sort of loads it will have to withstand?
