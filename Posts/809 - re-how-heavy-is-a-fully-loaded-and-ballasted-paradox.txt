Dave, Dave,

Do a little experiment. Take a pound of sheet lead and form it into a hollow shape that will float. It will dispace the same amount of water as your pond of foam. The immersed volumes will be the same.

for a further discusion of this, see:

Duckworks Magazine - Columns - Chuck - Ballast: Boring or Beautiful 

Chuck's example is lead and feathers, rather than lead and foam, but the arguement is the same.
