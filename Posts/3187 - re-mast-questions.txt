At the top I brought the flex out just below the wooden plug. At the bottom I fitted a socket as low as I could so that I could reach it from inside.

Sorry for the delay, I've been away.

You could do that. I brought mine out on the aft of the mast and reach it from inside the boat (a bit of a contortionist trick actually)

I put it as low as I could and still have clearance for the plug to go in. It is a water resistant plug/socket so water splashing in shouldn't bother it. The socket fixes on from outside so I left some spare wire inside the mast to make the connection easy (and if I damage the wire at the top I can pull some more through without having to replace it all.)
