Hi Bill

Al's wiring comes out as a plug recessed in the end of the mast that is below deck. It might be an idea to contact him for a picture.
I've made a LED light enclosed in one of those balls that have washing machine powder in. I am going to string it up seperately when I feel it is needed.

Bill, you figured out the top routing from the pictures of Zoe. What I did at the bottom was to bring the flex out under deck level and connect it to a plug just under forward port deck. It has worked out fine, it's easy to connect and disconnect.
