Do you mean the whole section of the sail in front of the mast is fluttering, or just the leading edge? If the former then I have noticed that too, I tend to sail with the luff just occasionally fluttering as that seems to give the best performance.

Unexpectedly I seem to get best sailing performance on the port tack (sail against the mast) and also I never have trouble tacking from this position whereas on the starboard tack (sail in free air) I still occasionally get stuck going through the tack and have to have another go.

Mind you, I am sure my sail needs some attention. I have tried to take some photos of it while hard on the wind, and will post them, if they show anything, when the film is finished.

Hi All,
My sail set's great on all points except one. Anytime I'm on a starboard tack or any point where the boom and yard are against the mast. when I get my tell tales to fly right I get a little flutter on the leading edge of the sail. If I tighten the main sheet to stop the flutter my tell Tales are off a little. I cant tell much differience in speed, bit it seems when I get the fluttering to stop the sail is sheeted in too tight. Any ideas ?
