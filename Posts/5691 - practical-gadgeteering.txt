Today I was wondering what a 16 inch propeller might look like on the tiny transom of a paradox. I hung the 16 inch diameter prop from a rope on the transom to see the general proportions involved. I filled in the missing "Frankenstein-outboard-motor" which will hold the propeller, with imagination. I took pictures and posted them under Ironsides photos.
