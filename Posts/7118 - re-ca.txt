I don't believe Matt had to make any changes to Elusion's rig because the chine runners on the newest boat are similarly long to those on Paradox, and of course he is very familar with that design. I noticed this detail right away when I saw Elusion for the first time at Fort Desoto, Florida in 2010 and I had Enigma there for comparison on the same beach. Of course it could be just luck that he got it right, and I did notice that Swamp Thing also had her mast raked back somewhat too. However, I'm not sure if this was done later. Incidentally, I'm still working on getting Swamp Thing back on the water so that I can see how she sail compared to her sister ships. One thing I changed was to add 1/4" to the width of the chine runners. This modificatione was suggested to me by Matt, and I'm curious as to what improvements it will make to the original design.
