Subject: Re: Paradox database

Hi Mark,

You might want to add my name to your list. I would be interested in corresponding with any other Paradox builders owners in the Los Angeles, California area. Incidentally, I also completed a Selway-Fisher 50/50 sailing canoe so we appear to share the same taste.

Details of my Paradox are as follows:

She is 90% complete.
No name as of yet.
Follows plans exactly.
Being built in Los Angeles, CA.

I will be sure to send photos in due course. I estimate completion by this summer.

Regards,

Bill.

Many thanks, Mark. Your details have been added to the database and I'll be looking forward to seeing photos of your boat.

It's unlikely my Paradox will be finished this year, because I'll be away during July and August, the best months for building out of doors in the UK.

I just don't have room to build indoors.

I'd be interested in seeing any photos of your 50/50.

Cheers,
Bill.
