I was somewhat perturbed when I saw pictures showing about 15 or more clamps being used for building deck beams. How many do I actually need?

Here's a list of the tools Don recommends:

Could anyone take that list and delete from it the tools deemed not to be essential? Also, what in your opinion are the absolutely necessary tools?
