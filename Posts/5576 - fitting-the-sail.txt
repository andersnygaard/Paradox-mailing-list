Subject: Fitting the Sail

The sailrite kit is finished and all sewn per the dimensions and instructions provided by Sailrite. However the corner gromets and the depth of the sleeves created a mismatch with the yard which was per plan. I considered cutting and resewing the sail sleeves but didn't. By making the new yard 114 inches(or 2900 mm) the lead angle of the lashing from the holes in the yard to the grommets in the sail work properly with this particular sail, as sewn. I set up the mast for the first time and raised the sail to discover the problem. I'm really stunned that the seams and draft of the finished sail are as good as they seem to be, ( having never sewn a sail, or much of anything really ). I need to see some strong wind working in the sail before I can know if it is really satisfactory or successful. I put up a new picture of the sail. By looking closly one might see the new yard ends and the angle to the gommets. These grommets are aluminim and rivited on with six little rivets. They came with the sailkit.
