Hi folks,

There is a splendid article on the home page at Duckworks at the moment.
http://www.duckworksmagazine.com/00/DM2000/columns/slogging/03/dingo.htm
It sums up, much more eloquently than I ever could, my feelings about those who want to 'improve' on a design.

When I built my Paradox I too was tempted to make several modifications to the plans, but sanity prevailed and I built as drawn. I am very glad I did as I now see that *all* my proposed changes would have been for the worse.

Hoping for calm nights

Al,
Yeovil, England.
