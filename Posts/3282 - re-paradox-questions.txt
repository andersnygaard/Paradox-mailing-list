Al, I looked over your site and the little boat looks good. I have built some wood kayaks, but have never sailed. Now I have an empty space in my garage and no ongoing projects so I might start to build one of these boats. The only problem I have with this boat is the limited sleeping space. it looks like it would be fine for one person but i dont know about 2 people in that small of a space.

Hi,

It took me about 18 months. Look at www.as4jg.freeuk.com for building pictures.

There is a flat sleeping area 1.9m x 0.9m. A small mod to the access forward would give another ~0.5m legroom.

Hoping for calm nights
