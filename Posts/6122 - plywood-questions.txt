Hi,

I am thinking about building Paradox and I am at the stage of collecting info and selecting the proper materials. Some time ago (~2006), in this forum there was a discussion about using two 3/8 sheets (epoxied together)instead of 3/4 for the bottom and two 1/4 instead of 1/2 for the sides. The argument was that it would be stronger, and, most importantly, easier to work with (to bend).

So I was wondering if somebody actually tried that. Also, I'd like to hear from those who built their boats, if this approach, in their opinion, offers any advantage.

Please, mention what type/grade of plywood have you used and how difficult was it to bend it in shape.

Thanks,
Alexander
