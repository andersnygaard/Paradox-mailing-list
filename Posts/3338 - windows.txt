As I sat inside Enuf this morning with the wife throwing buckets of water at me - alright, the second bits a porky - I realised that it would be handy to be able to see out through the cabin sides.
I hummed and hawed for a bit and decided on routing out the window shapes and recesses. Of course a check of my router bits revealed that the thinner ones were only 8mm long and the ply is 9mm thick. So off to B&amp;Q where a 25.4 mm deep by 6.4mm (why can't they just say 1" by quarter inch on the packet) bit could only leave the building accompanied by thirty quids worth of other stuff that I didn't know I needed when I went in. I nearly bought myself a new band saw as well - only =A380 - my current one came out of a closing factory in the '70's and looks like it may be a Lend-Lease item from the first world war. I have to get the blades made for it and it is showing its age.
Anyway, the point of all this is that the cabin top never got cut today. I did, however, make the two hand grabs that support the centre beam from some oak salvaged from an old desk found in the basement of my daughter's tower block.
Two steps nforward and one step back!
