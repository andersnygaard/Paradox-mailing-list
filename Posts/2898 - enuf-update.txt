After finally getting the foredeck fitted I have spent the last couple of days fairing and 
sheathing the complete deck. It seems to be ok thanks especially to Rob Hewitt of UK Epoxies 
who always has the time to explain how to do things. Also, his products don't make me gag 
like West Systems and they are cheaper! 

Next Thursday I hope to turn her on her side and finish shaping the chine runners.

The interior is finished excepting the vent box and the electrics. I've decided to keep electrics 
to a minimum; mainly for charging batteries and running GPS, depth finder and radio. 
Paraffin (kerosene?) anchor lamp and candle lantern for internal lighting and heat.
How are the other builders getting on?
