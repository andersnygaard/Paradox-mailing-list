Hello,

The curvature of the yuloh is what makes it twist into the correct attitude at the end of each stroke. A traditional yuloh also had a rope from the end of the handle to the deck whch actually took most of the load. I believe Matt did not include the rope and perhaps with the small size of the Paradox it is not required. 
I have read the total curve should be between 7 and 10 degrees. I made up two yulohs years ago which confirms to me that angle seems about right. My yulohs worked well, on two very different displacement cruising boats. I would add though that a friend had a warped skulling oar which seemed to push at least as well with the added benefit that when let go the vertical blade dragged docilely behind the moving boat unlike the horizontal blade of the yuloh, which tried to plane sort of behind the boat. This is itself might not be that bad but trying to resume skulling/yulohing ,(getting the thing to dig into the water again) required a lot more effort.
