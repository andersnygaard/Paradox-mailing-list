Years ago, I worked in a boatyard and tanks were sometimes made of glass and epoxy with a wood form. After careful layup (with attention to mix, curing, etc), the completed tank was washed out, then steam cleaned, and that seemed to eliminate the epoxy odors. I'm sure the brand of epoxy mattered, but I don't recall what the type was. Besides, formulations have surely changed since then.
 
I know that there are commercially made glass and epoxy potable water tanks that no one has gone blind from...

I'm more than a little concerned about drinking water that has been in contact with epoxy, any thoughts on the pros and cons? And if cons, any solutions?
