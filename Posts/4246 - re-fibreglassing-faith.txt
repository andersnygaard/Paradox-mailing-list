Hi Bill.

I am hoping also to have NOLI in the water by June, but depending on to many things. I am at present working on the cabin top and hatch with the rudder blanks cut out and mast and spars also under way. So much to do and so little time. Due to a rush drawing job I only managed about two hours on the boat last week during all that fine weather. Was I p****d off. I will post a photo in my new NOLI folder. Have you sorted out the sail yet? And Al. How do you rate your sail?

I'm going to have get a move on, if 'Faith' is to be afloat by the beginning of June. I do have the advantage that I'm retired and if the weather is good for building and there are no other pressing demands, I'll be enjoying the fun of building.

Cheers,
Bill.
