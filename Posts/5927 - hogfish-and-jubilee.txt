Subject: Hogfish and Jubilee

There are some photos in the files here of these two designs.

Good views of the chine runners and rudder assembly on the 40' Jubilee. Unfortunately no visible details of a centerboard. I think both Bolger and Yrvind feel a bow-centerboard is necessary to maintain headway and balance when using such a large rudder area. (See the write-up in BWAOM re: Dart Dingy and Cartopper.)

Also may help when docking a 40' hull under power. (Bow rudder as well??)

Also Sven Yrvind continues to translate his website over to English.
