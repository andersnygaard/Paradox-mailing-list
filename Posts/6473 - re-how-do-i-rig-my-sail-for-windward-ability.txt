Subject: Re: How do I rig my sail for windward ability

Hello Bill,

There are no battens in the sail, probably just the photo makes it look that way. I was actually still sailing (in the Swan River) when that photo was taken by someone ashore.

Actually I do have an engine the same model as yours which I use on a dinghy, but I've not tried it on Small Fry. I've been enjoying seeing how far I can get with the yuloh. Initally I made do with the paddle you see in my interior photo, but eventually I got around to building the yuloh as per plan. I can get Small Fry moving nicely in windless conditions.

From what you've said about force 5 I'm probably getting similar results from Small Fry. My gut feeling is that the windward progress is limited more by the sail than by the hull design since, as you said, the paradox likes a bit of freedom. The few times I tried to point too high she just ends up losing all speed and stalling, sort of hove to I suppose.

When I built Small Fry I tried to stick to the plan as much as possible. The only serious changes I made were replacing the sliding hatch with a hinged hatch like Sven Yrvind's boats (though I did this in such a way that it would be easy to convert to the sliding hatch later). The other major change was setting the windows flush in frames. It took more work to build the frames than the original plan calls for, but I prefer the slightly more conventional result. It also cut down the window size slightly but not enough to interfere with good 360 degree vis.

By the way, when I was thinking about colours for Small Fry I was really quite impressed with your boat and thought seriously about using a similar scheme... obviously I didn't end up going that way but just thought you should know your work was inspiring to me when I was still building Small Fry.

Cheers,
Geoff.
