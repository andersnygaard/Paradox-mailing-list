My take on it comes from years of owning boats with chine runners. I've additionally owned many other boats so I've had some real chances to compare.

Chine runners are not excellent leeway prevention devices. At the same time, many cruiser type boats don't sail to WW well either. In the hands of someone who knows how to sail a paradox, they will sail to WW as well as any other heavy displacement cruising boat of similar size if not better under specific conditions.

I'll put it to you this way. There is more concrete evidence for chine runners working than there is for any of the gods existence. Not that facts will actually change any minds!

Ultimately, you take risks to gain outcomes, or you play it safe and stay back with the status quo crowd.

Hi Graeme,

The comments from me and Chris are in support of chine runners on Paradox. There have been other boats that used the chine runner concept with success. The designer Matt Layden also developed this design over a period of time on several different boats also with great success. My understanding is that Chine runners are designed to deal with the unique environment of the Bahamas where shallow draft sailing is required. If you are in an area where a shallow draft sailboat is not required then there are other designs that might be better suited.
