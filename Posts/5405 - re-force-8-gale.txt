I'm thinking it is the pipe that the tack strop feeds through - called a spacer pipe on the plans. Might get bent under stress?

The "swivel rod" is a part that I have wondered about. It is held in place inside the end of the boom by that single #10 stop screw?

The biggest concern in my view would be about keeping that roller furling assembly running flawlessly if going a long way in heavy weather. It will be interesting to see how Sven Yrvind goes about it as he is planning to use this rig on "Yrvind 1/2" which he is building. http://www.yrvind.com/present_project.html Will he go with wood or carbon fiber spars and maybe sealed bearings in the ends of the boom? Maybe a small storm tri-sail?
