Hi Phil.

I take it you are talking about fixing the ply panels to the gunwale.
I think Matt called for 1/2" ply for the sides due to using exterior ply which is weaker than marine.
If you are using marine ply I don't see why you cannot use 3/8" instead.
As for fixings, I would not think twice for using brass screws, after all the main thing that will be securing the ply to the gunwale is the glue.
If you are using epoxy for gluing and a filler it will act as a sealer as well.
The whole thing is covered in glass cloth anyway.
I bought a load of good quality brass screws from Screwfix. Less than half the price I could buy locally.
They also do them in stainless steel.
