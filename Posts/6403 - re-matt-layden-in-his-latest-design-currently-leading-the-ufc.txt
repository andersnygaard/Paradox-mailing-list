Mike, the St. Mary is flowing to the Atlantic, so they are or will be paddling up river against the current.  I am sure that it is flowing pretty good but I don't have that info.  After the 40 mile portage to the Suwannee they will be going down stream with the current.  There are some class #? rapids.  Again I am sure it is flowing but I don't know how much.  I think Matt has been able to sail up to about where he is now but will have to paddle now and the sail will be useless, in the way and have to come down.  There likely is better info on the Watertribe Discussion board.  I have not been able to check up today....yet.

I am paying close attention to the race myself. This has been fantastic. As of right now, 11PM Eastern Thurs Night it seems like Matt is ahead of the Manitou and Whitecaps on the river!

Does anyone have any info on that river, as in flow direction and so forth?

I was pondering whether the *slightly* ballasted displacement approach would allow a boat like Elusion to actually capitalize on favorable currents (though I imagine it would be a major detraction against current). 

Just pondering. I have been amazed as he has simply blown me away with the performance of this little boat of his. Perhaps its just his experience as a sailor (and ability to sail with so little sleep?).
