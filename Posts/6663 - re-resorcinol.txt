Thanks a lot rkg_82.

They both appear plenty strong.  Where I'm at, the summer gets pretty hot, plus some of my future trips will be to even hotter climates, so I suspect the resorcinol was a good choice for my future plans.

I'm very pleased so far, and definitely agree that a close, tight joint, clearly adds to the bond strength.  The first joint I had didn't sit as tight prior to the bond (poor scarph technique on my part), and it did make some cracking noises for quite a while (those noises have stopped, so I suspect those fragments are all loose now, and the better matching portion of the joints still remain).

I know one thing.  I can't get any of the boards apart, which I guess is the main thing.

Respectfully,
Okie Bob
