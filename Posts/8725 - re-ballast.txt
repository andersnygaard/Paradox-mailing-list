Before going for a junk rigged Paradox, I went through most of the questions raised here. For the sheeting - the paradox boom is reaching over the transom, but if you look at the sail, the leech line goes quite a bit inwards, so in the middle it is actually above the deck.

I have chosen a sailplan with vertical leech (more commonly used on conversions), versus fan type; to have CE as far back as possible; and to get a lower aspect ratio. I have also moved the mast a bit forward, to just in front of the bulkhead; and as in general the CE has moved a bit forward, for balancing I have moved chinerunners a bit forward as well.

Of course there are some advantages on the original lug sail; as well as would/will with junk rig. I will lose some advantages, such as easy lowering the reefed sail on deck side (as there will be batten barrels to loosen)...
