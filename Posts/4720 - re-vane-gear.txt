Thank you for that Glen.  Sorry to hear about your wife.  I hope 
you'll be able to sort out the light weather sailing.  Running in 
light winds has always been a problem for windvane systems.  When the 
tiller lines of Paradox are tensioned correctly they would contribute 
quite a bit of friction which would not help.

I'm edging toward an electronic system because of its simplicity and 
light weight, and as I do not intend to undertake long ocean 
passages, topping up the batteries should not be a problem.

Nevertheless, if you perfect you windvane gear I would be tempted to 
copy it.

Bill.
